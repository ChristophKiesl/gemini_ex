ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.  Substantially all of its operations are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE), a utility company.  Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned, non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), which was formed in 2016 and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at the Port of Tacoma, Washington.
Puget Energy is owned through a holding company structure by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings).  All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings. Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCIMC), the Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System (OMERS) and PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V. In July 2021, CPPIB entered into an agreement to sell its shares to Macquarie Washington Clean Energy Investment, L.P., and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board. The sale was approved by the Washington Commission and closed on February 22, 2022. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as “the Company.”
Corporate Strategy
Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.  Puget Energy’s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE, and be the clean energy provider of choice for its customers.
Customers and Revenue Overview
PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.  PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.

PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult. Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage and affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses. While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions. PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and corresponding higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and corresponding lower power costs in the third quarter of the year. While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers. For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report and Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

General Rate Case Filing
PSE filed a GRC which includes a three year multiyear rate plan with the Washington Commission on January 31, 2022, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 13.6% and 13.0% respectively in 2023; 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively in 2024; and 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively, in 2025. PSE requested a return on equity of 9.9% in all three rate years. PSE requested an overall rate of return of 7.39% in 2023; 7.44% in 2024; and 7.49% in 2025. The filing requests recovery of forecasted plant additions through 2022 as required by RCW 80.28.425 as well as forecasted plant additions through 2025, the final year of the multiyear rate plan. The next phase of the filing will be to establish a procedural calendar for the adjudication of the case. 
PSE filed a GRC with the Washington Commission on June 20, 2019, requesting an overall increase in electric and natural gas rates of 6.9% and 7.9% respectively. On July 8, 2020, the Washington Commission issued its order on PSE’s GRC. The ruling provided for a weighted cost of capital of 7.39% or 6.8% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.4%. The order also resulted in a combined net increase to electric of $29.5 million, or 1.6%, and to natural gas of $36.5 million, or 4.0%. However, the Washington Commission extended the amortization of certain regulatory assets, PSE’s electric decoupling deferral, and PSE’s purchased gas adjustment (PGA) deferral to mitigate the impact of the rate increase in response to the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced the electric revenue 
increase to approximately $0.9 million, or 0.05%, and the natural gas increase to $1.3 million, or 0.15%, and became effective October 15, 2020 and October 1, 2020, respectively.
On August 6, 2020, PSE filed a petition for judicial review with the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County challenging the portion of the final order that requires PSE to pass back to customers the reversal of plant-related excess deferred income taxes in a manner that may deviate from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) normalization and consistency rules.
On July 30, 2021, the IRS issued a private letter ruling (PLR) to PSE which concludes that the Washington Commission’s methodology for reversing plant-related excess deferred income taxes is an impermissible methodology under the IRS normalization and consistency rules. On September 28, 2021, the Washington Commission issued an order amending its order previously issued on July 8, 2020 to correct for items which were determined to be impermissible under IRS normalization and consistency rules as detailed in the PLR. To reflect the impact of the PLR, PSE has recorded a regulatory asset and additional revenues of $24.5 million in its operating results through December 31, 2021, of which $5.6 million was collected from customers. Therefore, the annualized overall rate impact for this element is an increase of $15.8 million, or 0.7%, for electric and $3.1 million, or 0.3%, for natural gas for a total of $18.9 million with rates effective October 1, 2021. This led to an overall annualized net increase to electric rates of $77.1 million, or 3.7%, an increase of $17.5 million above the $59.6 million granted in the revised final order. The order also led to an overall annualized net increase to natural gas rates of $45.3 million, or 5.9%, an increase of $2.4 million above the $42.9 million granted in the revised final order. The Washington Commission maintained adjustments that mitigated the impacts of the rate increases in response to the economic instability created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced the electric revenue increase to approximately $48.3 million, or 2.3%, and the natural gas increase to $4.9 million, or 0.6%. 
For additional information, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
Power Cost Only Rate Case 
A power cost only rate case (PCORC) is a limited-scope proceeding to reset power cost rates.  In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.  To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission is not required to but historically has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
On December 9, 2020, PSE filed its 2020 PCORC. The filing proposed an increase of $78.5 million (or an average of approximately 3.7%) in the Company's overall power supply costs with an anticipated effective date in June 2021. On February 2, 2021, PSE supplemented the PCORC to update its power costs, leading to a requested increase from $78.5 million to $88.0 million (or an average of approximately 4.1%). 
On March 2, 2021, the parties to the PCORC reached an unopposed multiparty settlement in principle. The settlement resulted in an estimated revenue increase of $65.3 million or 3.1%. A term of the settlement requires PSE to include in its next GRC (or another proceeding in 2022) the issue of whether the PCORC should continue, and further prohibits PSE from filing another PCORC before this issue is litigated. On June 1, 2021, the Washington Commission issued its Final Order approving and adopting the settlement and authorizing and requiring a power cost update through a compliance filing. 
On June 17, 2021, PSE filed a compliance filing with the Washington Commission with a revenue increase of $70.9 million or 3.3% due to the update on power costs with rates effective July 1, 2021. 
Decoupling Filings
While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs and fixed production costs from most residential, commercial and industrial customers to mitigate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer. As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels. PSE's energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism. The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption except for fixed production costs, which are held at the level of cost from the most recent rate proceeding and are not impacted by customer growth. Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period. For further details regarding decoupling filings, see Note 4, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 
Electric Rate Filings
Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism
PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the “power cost baseline” level of power costs. The “power cost baseline” levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions. Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
Effective January 1, 2017, the following graduated scale is used in the PCA mechanism:

 | Company's Share | Customers’ Share
Annual Power Cost Variability | Over | Under | Over | Under
Over or Under Collected by up to $17 million | 100% | 100% | —% | —% 
Over or Under Collected by between $17 million - $40 million | 35 | 50 | 65 | 50 
Over or Under Collected beyond $40 + million | 10 | 10 | 90 | 90 

Power Cost Adjustment Clause Filing
PSE updated its Schedule 95 rates in the Power Cost Adjustment Clause tariff to reflect the transition fee as required by Section 12 of the Microsoft Special Contract. Additionally, Schedule 95 rates also include portions of fixed power cost adjustments per the allowed decoupling rate re-allocation resulting from Microsoft becoming a transportation customer as well as small variable power cost adjustments.
Conservation Rider
The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates. 
Property Tax Tracker Mechanism
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year.
Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff
The Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff passes through to customers the benefits associated with the wind-related treasury grants. The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups. The filing is adjusted annually for new federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. Rates change annually on January 1. 
Low Income Program Tracker Tariff
The Low Income Tracker Tariff recovers changes in costs for the low income bill payment assistance program (as approved in Washington Commission Docket Nos. UE-011570 and UG-011571). The annual filing requests these changes through the existing low income program funding mechanism previously approved by the Washington Commission. The mechanism allows PSE to periodically adjust its electric and natural gas rates to reflect changes in actual sales and costs. Rates change annually on October 1. 
Residential Exchange Benefit
The residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE receives from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). Rates change biennially on October 1.
Natural Gas Rate Filings
Cost Recovery Mechanism
The purpose of the cost recovery mechanism (CRM) is to recover costs related to projects included in PSE's pipeline replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system. Rates change annually on November 1. 
Purchased Gas Adjustment 
PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest. PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances. A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism. Rates typically change annually on November 1, although out-of-cycle rate changes are allowed at other times of the year if needed.
Property Tax Tracker Mechanism
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year.
Conservation Rider
The natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year, as well as actual compared to the forecasted load set in rates.

Electric Supply
At December 31, 2021, PSE’s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,809 megawatts (MW).   In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments. When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.
The following table shows PSE’s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020:

Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts
During 2021, approximately 13.3% of PSE’s energy supply was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia).   PSE’s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
For the year ended, December 31, 2021, PSE's portion of the power output of the PUDs’ projects are set forth below:
 | | | Company’s Annual Share (Approximate)
Project | Contract Expiration Year | License Expiration Year | Percent of Output | | MW Capacity

Wanapum Development | 2052 | 2052 | 0.6 | | | 
Total | | | | | 697 | 

Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements
PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.  PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.  PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) for 300 MW of seasonal capacity exchange which currently has no set expiration. During and since emerging from its 2001-2004 and 2019-2020 bankruptcy proceedings, PG&E delivered on the energy exchange contract and has continued to meet the exchange contract through its current bankruptcy proceedings.
PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016. PSE has committed up to 450 MW of existing BPA transmission for the EIM market. Participation has resulted in reduced costs for PSE customers of approximately $20.7 million in year ended December 31, 2021, enhanced system reliability, integration of variable energy resources, and geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources. The calculated benefits represent the annual cost savings of the EIM dispatch compared with a counter-factual dispatch without the EIM. Benefits can take the form of cost savings or revenues or their combination. Benefits include greenhouse gases (GHG) revenue, transfer revenues and flexible ramping revenues.
PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE’s system.  These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use. Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.  PSE’s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.  Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE’s load is available for sale to third parties.  PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
In 2021, PSE had 4,897 MW and 595 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.  PSE’s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers
PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet electrical demand through gas-fired generation. Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as turbine fueling varies depending on market heat rates.  Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.  PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas.  PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE’s natural gas-fired generation resources.  
The following table presents the volumes of natural gas for power year ended inventory values:

Plymouth | 1,552 | 2,345 | 2,136

Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development
PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file an electric and natural gas integrated resource plan (IRP) every two years. Requests for proposals for generation resources are required to be filed with the Washington Commission prior to being issued. The final 2021 IRP and the 2021 Request for Proposals for All Resources (All-source RFP) were both filed on April 1, 2021. From the 2021 All-source RFP, Table 2, cumulative capacity need by year, the capacity shortfalls and surpluses are:

 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 
Projected MW shortfall/(surplus) | (230) | (350) | (306) | (257)

PSE projects its future energy needs will not exceed current resources in its supply portfolio until 2026 because of the addition of new resources from the 2018 RFP. With the expected elimination of Colstrip units 3 & 4 from PSE’s energy supply portfolio starting in 2026, which removes approximately 370 MW of capacity, and the expiration of PSE’s 380 MW coal-transition contract with TransAlta when the Centralia coal plant is retired at the end of 2025, the projected capacity shortfall will be 369 MW and increases to 527 MW by 2027, a large increase from the surplus capacity in 2025. The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2021 IRP. As part of the Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act (CETA), PSE must achieve sales with renewable or non-emitting resources of at least 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2045. PSE’s current transmission portfolio includes approximately 1,500 MW of firm transmission rights that deliver energy from the Mid‐Columbia trading hub to the PSE load center. The 2021 IRP included a market risk assessment that evaluated the ongoing availability of the short‐term power contracts associated with the transmission rights. The table above assumes all 1,500 MW of firm transmission is available to procure at market for meeting PSE’s peak need. The assessment in the IRP proposed a decrease to 500 MW by the year 2027. This would change the resource shortfall to 185 MW in 2023 and increasing to a 574 MW shortfall by 2025.

Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers
PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta).  PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas.  All of PSE’s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline, LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE’s service territory.  Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE’s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during periods of high demand or reduced supply.  Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.  Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity. Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE’s natural gas system.  Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE’s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.  PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and transportation capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
PSE’s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.  The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs.  Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE’s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE’s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
Natural Gas Storage Capacity
PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP’s pipeline to serve PSE’s natural gas customers.  The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE, and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period.  Combined with capacity contracted from NWP’s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility. Of this total, PSE designates 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity to serve natural gas customers. The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE’s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 640,600 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources. 
The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection. PSE holds 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,400 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of one year and has rights to extend such agreements.
LNG and Propane-Air Resources
LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.  Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
PSE holds a contract for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth for use of the PSE generation fleet.  PSE uses the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE’s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis. In addition, PSE holds 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity from Plymouth for the generation fleet. The balance of the LNG capacity is delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE’s generation fleet.
PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total storage capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
Tacoma LNG Facility
The Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma completed commissioning on February 1, 2022 and is expected to commence commercial operations in the first quarter of 2022. In December 2019, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) issued the air quality permit for the facility, and the Pollution Hearings Control Board of Washington State upheld the approval following extended litigation. When in-service, the Tacoma LNG facility will provide peak-shaving services to PSE’s natural gas customers, and provide LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market at a lower cost due to the facility's scale. Pursuant to an order by the Washington Commission, PSE will be allocated 43.0% of the capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility, and Puget LNG will be allocated the remaining 57.0% of the capital and operating costs. The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE will be subject to regulation by the Washington Commission.
Natural Gas Transportation Capacity
PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by Cascade Natural Gas Company (CNGC), NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Enbridge Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).  GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TC Energy Corporation companies.  PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
PSE holds approximately 542,900 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE’s service territory.  In addition, PSE holds approximately 447,100 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie to natural gas customers.  PSE holds approximately 202,900 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities.  In addition, PSE holds over 34,200 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities. PSE’s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 23 years.  However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts’ current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast’s pipeline is 135,800 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to four years.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast’s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 88,400 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to four years and an option for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract.  PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 79,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to four years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining term of two years. PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, with remaining term of two years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 40,600 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two years. PSE holds 259,000 Dth per day of firm capacity on CNGC to connect generating facilities to the pipeline grid with remaining terms of one year.
Capacity Release
The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.  Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.  The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.  PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.  PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.  Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE’s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
Energy Efficiency
PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.  PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices. PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms. However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales. To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2017 from the Washington Commission for continuation of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts.
Environment
PSE’s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.  See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE’s operations and costs.
Air and Climate Change Protection
PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip.  All of these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years.  This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants. PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants. These facilities also emit GHG, and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.  The Colstrip plant represents PSE’s most significant source of GHG emissions.
Species Protection
PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.  A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.  Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.  Prohibitions and permitting requirements set forth in these statutes and related regulations have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
Remediation
PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.  These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.  The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state).  PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip. These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any entity that generated and disposed of (or arranged for the disposal of) hazardous or other regulated substances at a contaminated site.
Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal
Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.  These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act (as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal) and hazardous or dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
Water Protection
PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products to regulated waters are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state), which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.  This includes most generation facilities (and all of those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
Mercury Emissions
Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.  Compliance, based on a rolling twelve-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement.
Siting New Facilities
In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.  These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation
Recent and future environmental laws and regulations have been and may be adopted at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations. PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets. Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental laws and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE’s operations and costs.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
PSE implements both short-term measures and long-term strategies designed to manage GHG emissions in a scientifically sound and responsible fashion. The Company has worked closely with federal, state and local governments on deep decarbonization, and the reduction and mitigation of GHG emissions. As a result, the Company intends and expects be net zero methane emissions by the end of 2022, coal free by 2025 and its electric system will be carbon neutral by 2030. Further, the Company has an aspirational goal to be beyond net zero by 2045 for electric supply, gas sales and operations. The Company is also helping Washington State address GHG emissions from the transportation sector by investing in electric vehicles and developing liquefied natural gas for maritime and commercial transportation. PSE also remains mindful of our customers' expectation of reliable, affordable service. The Company considers the cost of the decarbonization efforts to date, as well as future efforts, in its IRP process, and will continue to engage in climate and GHG policy development. 
PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting
PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington Department of Ecology including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations. Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time. Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE’s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
The most recent data indicate that PSE’s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2020 were 8.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.  Approximately 25.3% of PSE’s total GHG emissions (approximately 2.1 million metric tons) are associated with PSE’s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip. Compared to 2019, total emissions decreased appreciably, by 26.2%. This trend is due primarily to the retirement of Colstrip Units 1 and 3, totaling 307 MW of coal capacity, effective December 31, 2019. PSE’s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers’ needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
Executive Orders Addressing Environmental Issues
President Joseph Biden issued several executive orders in January 2021 that are likely to affect PSE’s environmental obligations. The new executive orders revoked several existing executive orders and established new federal environmental mandates, including rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change, which requires commitments to reduce GHG emissions, among other things.
Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules: New and Existing Power Plants
The EPA sets rules that apply to both new and existing power plants regarding GHGs. In 2015, the EPA set a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs. of CO2/megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology. New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs. of CO2/MWh. Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) was reaffirmed by the EPA in this rule as the “best system of emission reductions” (BSER). In 2018, due to the high cost and limited geographic availability of CCS, EPA issued a proposed rule that the BSER for newly constructed coal-fired units is the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle in combination with the best operating practices, but did not take action on a final rule nor has EPA proposed to amend the NSPS. In January 2021, EPA issued a framework for determining when standards are appropriate for GHG emissions from stationary source categories under Clean Air Act section 111(b)(1)(A). 
 In August 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, referred to as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants. The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to develop plans for meeting these goals. 
  In June 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP rule and finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act as a CPP rule replacement. The ACE rule established emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired plants. On January 19, 2021 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued an opinion vacating the ACE rule and remanding the rule back to the Agency for further consideration consistent with its opinion, after finding that the Agency had misinterpreted the Clean Air Act when adopting the ACE rule. In February 2021, the EPA issued a memorandum notifying states that it will not requires the submittal of plans to the EPA under Section 111(d) because the court vacated the ACE rule without reinstating the CPP. The ACE rule will be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court (West Virginia v. EPA) and oral argument is scheduled for February, 28, 2022. PSE joined a coalition of utilities defending the vacatur of the ACE rule along with EPA, as well as, a coalition of states that includes Washington State. PSE cannot predict either the outcome of this case or its impact on the ACE rule or the CPP rule. 
Washington Clean Air Rule
The Washington Clean Air Rule (CAR) was adopted in September 2016 in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from “covered entities” located within Washington State. Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE. The CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately 5.0% every three years. Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others. 
In September 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging the CAR. In September 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to the CAR in Thurston County Superior Court. In March 2018, the Thurston County Superior Court invalidated the CAR. The Washington Department of Ecology appealed the Superior Court decision in May 2018. As a result of the appeal, direct review to the Washington State Supreme Court was granted and oral argument was held on March 16, 2019. In January 2020, the Washington Supreme Court affirmed that CAR is not valid for “indirect emitters,” meaning it does not apply to the sale of natural gas for use by customers. The court ruled, however, that the rule can be severed and is valid for direct emitters including electric utilities with permitted air emission sources, but remanded the case back to the superior court to determine which parts of the rule survive. The remand is pending in the superior court. In light of the Supreme Court decision, the federal court litigation was dismissed on March 11, 2020. Notably, the Climate Commitment Act prohibits the Department of Ecology from adopting or enforcing a program that regulates greenhouse gas emissions from a stationary source except as provided in the Act, which could effectively preempt the Clean Air Rule.
Washington Climate Commitment Act 
In 2021, the Washington Legislature adopted the Climate Commitment Act, which establishes a GHG emissions cap-and-invest program that will take effect on January 1, 2023. The Washington Department of Ecology is currently developing regulations to implement the program, but in general, the program will require covered entities to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for covered emissions. 
The Climate Commitment Act will regulate PSE both as an electric utility and as a natural gas distribution utility. PSE will be required to obtain emission allowances or offset credits for GHG emissions associated with electricity generated or imported into the state if the emissions associated with this generation exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. As an electric utility subject to Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act, which is discussed below, PSE will receive some emission allowances at no cost through 2050 to mitigate impacts to ratepayers. The Department of Ecology is working on implementing regulations which are expected to be finalized later this year.
Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act
In May 2019, Washington State passed the Clean Energy Transformation Act that supports Washington's clean energy economy and transitioning to a clean, affordable, and reliable energy future. The Clean Energy Transition Act requires all electric utilities to eliminate coal-fired generation from their allocation of electricity by December 31, 2025; to be carbon-neutral by January 1, 2030, through a combination of non-emitting electric generation, renewable generation, and/or alternative compliance options; and makes it the state policy that, by 2045, 100% of electric generation and retail electricity sales will come from renewable or non-emitting resources. Clean energy implementation plans are required every four years from each investor-owned utility (IOU) and must propose interim targets for meeting the 2045 standard between 2030 and 2045, and describe an actionable plan that the IOU intends to pursue to meet the standard. The Washington Commission may approve, reject or recommend alterations to an IOU’s plan.
In order to meet these requirements, the Act clarifies the Washington Commission’s authority to consider and implement performance and incentive-based regulation, multi-year rate plans, and other flexible regulatory mechanisms where appropriate. The Act mandates that the Washington Commission accelerate depreciation schedules for coal-fired resources, including transmission lines, to December 31, 2025, or to allow IOUs to recover costs in rates for earlier closure of those facilities. IOUs will be allowed to earn a rate of return on certain Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and 36 months deferred accounting treatment for clean energy projects (including PPAs) identified in the utility’s clean energy implementation plan.
IOUs are considered to be in compliance when the cost of meeting the standard or an interim target within the four-year period between plans equals a 2% increase in the weather-adjusted sales revenue to customers from the previous year. If relying on the cost cap exemption, IOUs must demonstrate that they have maximized investments in renewable resources and non-emitting generation prior to using alternative compliance measures. 
The law requires additional rulemaking by several Washington agencies for its measures to be enacted and PSE is unable to predict outcomes at this time. The Company intends to seek recovery of any costs associated with the clean energy legislation through the regulatory process.
Regional Haze Rule
In January 2017, the EPA provided revisions to the Regional Haze Rule which were published in the Federal Register. Among other things, these revisions delayed new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021; however, the end date will remain 2028. In January 2018, the EPA announced that it would revisit certain aspects of these revisions and PSE is unable to predict the outcome. Challenges to the 2017 Regional Haze Revision Rule are being held in abeyance in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, pending resolution of EPA’s reconsideration of the rule.
Coal Combustion Residuals
In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 2015, which regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D. The CCR rule currently is self-implementing at a federal level, or can be implemented and enforced by a state. The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage. 
In addition to the EPA's CCR rule, the operator of Colstrip and the state of Montana in 2012 entered into an Administrative Order of Consent (AOC) that also addresses clean up and closure of CCR units at Colstrip. The CCR rule and the AOC require significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015. PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of ash material at Colstrip in 2003. Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO). In 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned certain provisions of the CCR rule in 2018 and remanded some of its provisions back to the EPA. As a result of that decision and certain other developments, EPA has continued to work on developing new rules regarding CCR, including a date of April 11, 2021, for facilities to stop placing coal ash into unlined surface impoundments. In addition, the EPA has proposed a federal permitting program for coal ash disposal units along with the Water Infrastructure Improvement for the Nation Act (WIIN Act). The WIIN Act allows states to develop a state program for the regulation of CCR in lieu of the federal CCR rule, and also authorizes EPA to develop a federal permitting program. Currently, Montana has not applied for a state permit program, and EPA has not yet finalized a federal permitting program. 
PCB Handling and Disposal
In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-containing equipment.  
The rule was scheduled to be published in July 2015, but due to the number of comments received by the EPA, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions. It was anticipated that the rule would be published in November 2017, but was placed on indefinite hold by the administration of President Donald Trump via executive order). The executive order was rescinded and it is expected that the new administration will revisit the ANPRM and PSE will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group and the American Gas Association to monitor developments. At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this rulemaking will have on its operations, if any.
Human Capital Resources
PSE is committed to maintaining a work environment free of violence or harassment or discrimination of any kind, including harassment based on race, color, gender, sex, sexual orientation, age, religion, creed, national origin, marital status, veteran status or disability. Violence and threatening behavior are not tolerated by the Company, and employees are expected to treat one another with mutual respect and dignity. PSE complies with all federal, state, and local employment laws and prohibit unlawful discrimination in the recruiting, hiring, compensating, promoting, transferring, training, downgrading, terminating, laying off, or recalling of any person based upon race, religion, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran or military status, the presence of a disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. 
Additional information regarding the Company’s human capital measures and objectives is contained in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report that can be found on the Company’s website, www.pse.com. The information on the Company’s website is not, and will not be deemed to be a part of this annual report on Form 10-K or incorporated into the Company’s other filings with the SEC. 
Employee Overview
At December 31, 2021, PSE had 3,185 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 970 PSE employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW) or the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA). The UA contract was ratified effective December 2021, and will expire September 30, 2025. The IBEW contract was ratified effective April 1, 2020, and will expire March 31, 2026.
Puget Energy does not have any employees. PSE's employees provide employment services to Puget Energy and charges for their related salaries and benefits at cost.
Safety
Our safety objective is our foundation: Nobody gets hurt today so that we will feel safe and secure and able to perform at our best. When we’re safe, we can achieve our people objective of being a great place to work, with engaged employees who live our values, embrace an ownership culture and are motivated to drive results for our company and our customers. 
Our workplace safety program puts significant emphasis on education and training. Topics cover not only safety around the equipment and conditions employees work in but also day-to-day issues such as ergonomics and overall wellness. This ensures compliance with all federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Washington State Division of Occupational Safety and Health rules to ensure PSE provides and remains a safe and healthy working environment for all employees. PSE vehicles, equipment, and construction practices meet all applicable regulations and codes for worker and public safety. An executive-level steering committee oversees employee safety performance and programs. Policies are outlined in a comprehensive manual, the “Yellow Book,” which is maintained by PSE’s Safety and Health Department. As a way of recognizing the importance of safety, the annual employee incentive is tied to performance on goals for safety training, education and performance.
Employee Benefits 
To attract employees that meet the needs of the Company’s skilled workforce, the Company offers employee benefits that are a component of the Company’s total compensation package. Employee benefits include medical, health and dental insurance, long-term disability insurance, accidental death insurance, and our 401(k) plan. Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 along with IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, have access to the 401(k) plan. The two contribution sources from PSE are below:
•401(k) Company Matching: non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees PSE will match 100% on the first 3.0% of pay contributed and 50.0% on the next 3.0% of pay contributed, such that an employee who contributes 6.0% of pay will receive 4.5% of pay in company match. Company matching will be immediately vested.
•Company Contribution: UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4.0% of eligible pay placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4.0% of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE’s Cash Balance retirement plan. Non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the 4.0% contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan. The Company's 4.0% contribution will vest after three years of service.
For additional details see Item 8 (for employees hired prior to January 1, 2014) and Item 11 of this report. 
Employee Development
The Company offers development opportunities to employees. Some of the programs are:
•Employee wellness program: PSE maintains a wellness program that offers a wide range of resources and tools at little or no cost to employees and their families, including company sponsored wellness events and ongoing health and wellness communications. The PSE program also includes resources and tools that focus on mental health and wellbeing.
•Employee engagement: PSE has been conducting the Great Place to Work® survey since 2001 in an ongoing effort to create a culture that supports company values and enables PSE to do its best work on behalf of its customers and communities. The Company also conducts periodic pulse surveys to engage employees on relevant topics and provide them with opportunities to inform decisions. 
•Professional development and tuition reimbursement: PSE provides its employees with tools and development resources to enhance their skills and careers at the Company. Employees are encouraged to discuss their professional development and identify interests during one-to-one discussions and annual performance reviews with their supervisors. Employees are provided with learning opportunities that support our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and create a more inclusive culture. Leadership development is critical to PSE’s success and we provide training and support to help leaders more effectively navigate and work in different ways including virtually or in a hybrid workplace. PSE has multiple training programs and modules designed to educate employees on an assortment of health and safety practices and certifications, corporate ethics and compliance, business management, employee relations, environmental awareness, community engagement, and regulatory compliance, and emergency preparation and response. PSE also offers employees a tuition reimbursement program for relevant education opportunities.
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI): PSE is committed to being our customers’ clean energy partner of choice and views DEI as an essential aspect of the Company's aspirations. As a result, PSE's employees are critical to creating an inclusive culture and the Company is committed to creating opportunities for engagement and learning from one another. PSE has nine active employee resource groups (ERGs) that are designed for inspiring engagement. ERGs are a benefit for its members and the Company as they create environments for integrating diverse perspectives, provide additional insight into how to solve problems, innovate, and meet customer needs. ERGs also help to build connections with local communities and business partners resulting in strengthened relationships. PSE joined a regional coalition of employers through the Washington Employers of Racial Equity (WERE) pledging our support for the Commitment to Progress. PSE also participates with other member companies of the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) to help shape DEI objectives. PSE currently is in the first phase, assess, of the 10-year process. The assess phase includes the following: (i) embedding the DEI assessment into functional work; (ii) gathering and analyzing data related to our community, customers, people and suppliers; (iii) gathering input from stakeholders; (iv) evaluating WERE and EEI commitments and DEI related efforts and (v) creating a task force to energize PSE ERGs to enhance employee engagement.
