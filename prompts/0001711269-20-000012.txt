Merger of Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central
Evergy was incorporated in 2017 as Monarch Energy Holding, Inc. (Monarch Energy), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy Incorporated (Great Plains Energy). Prior to the closing of the merger transactions, Monarch Energy changed its name to Evergy and did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 9, 2017, by and among Great Plains Energy, Evergy Kansas Central, Monarch Energy and King Energy, Inc. (King Energy), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Monarch Energy (Amended Merger Agreement).
On June 4, 2018, Evergy completed the mergers contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement. As a result of the mergers, Great Plains Energy merged into Evergy, with Evergy surviving the merger and King Energy merged into Evergy Kansas Central, with Evergy Kansas Central surviving the merger. Following the completion of these mergers, Evergy Kansas Central and the direct subsidiaries of Great Plains Energy, including Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West, became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Evergy.
The merger was structured as a merger of equals in a tax-free exchange of shares that involved no premium paid or received with respect to either Great Plains Energy or Evergy Kansas Central. As a result of the closing of the merger transaction, each outstanding share of Great Plains Energy common stock was converted into 0.5981 shares of Evergy common stock and each outstanding share of Evergy Kansas Central common stock was converted into 1 share of Evergy common stock.
Evergy Kansas Central was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger and thus, the predecessor of Evergy. Evergy had separate operations for the period beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger relate to Evergy. The results of Great Plains Energy's direct subsidiaries have been included in Evergy's results of operations from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter. 
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the merger.
Regulation
Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas operations are regulated by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and Evergy Metro's Missouri operations and Evergy Missouri West are regulated by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (MPSC), in each case with respect to retail rates, certain accounting matters, standards of service and, in certain cases, the issuance of securities, certification of facilities and 
8

service territories. The Evergy Companies are also subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to transmission, wholesale sales and rates and other matters. Evergy has an indirect 94% ownership interest in Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek), which is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with respect to licensing, operations and safety-related requirements. 
The table below summarizes the rate orders in effect for Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's retail rate jurisdictions.

 | Regulator | Allowed Return on Equity | Rate-Making Equity Ratio | Effective Date
Evergy Kansas Central (a) | KCC | 9.3% | 51.46% | September 2018
Evergy Metro - Kansas | KCC | 9.3% | 49.09% | December 2018 
Evergy Metro - Missouri | MPSC | (b) | (b) | December 2018 
Evergy Missouri West | MPSC | (b) | (b) | December 2018 

(a) The KCC establishes rates for Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South on a consolidated basis.
(b) Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's current MPSC rate order does not contain an allowed return on equity or rate-making equity ratio.
Evergy expects its 2020 Kansas and Missouri jurisdictional retail revenues to be approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, based on historical averages of Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's total retail revenues.
See Item 7 MD&A, Critical Accounting Policies section, and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters.
Competition 
Missouri and Kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model. As a result, the Evergy Companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies. If Missouri or Kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice, Evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations, which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a write-off of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. 
Evergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory. This competition primarily occurs within the SPP Integrated Marketplace, in which Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are participants. This marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum regional cost-effectiveness. 
The SPP Integrated Marketplace is similar to other Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) markets currently operating in other regions of the United States.
Power Supply
Evergy has 14,700 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable purchased power agreements. Evergy's owned generation and purchased power from others, as a percentage of total MWhs generated and purchased, was approximately 71% and 29%, respectively, over the last two years. Evergy purchases power to meet its customers' needs, to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards. Management believes Evergy will be able to meet its future purchased power needs due to the coordination of planning and operations in the SPP region and existing power purchase agreements; however, price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand. 
9

Evergy's total capacity by fuel type, including both owned generating capacity and purchased power agreements, is detailed in the table below.

Fuel Type | Estimated MW Capacity | Percent of Total Capacity
Coal | 5,903 | | 40 | %
Natural gas and oil | 3,988 | | 27 | 
Wind (a) | 3,642 | | 24 | 
Uranium | 1,104 | | 8 | 
Solar, landfill gas and hydroelectric (b) | 72 | | 1 | 
Total capacity | 14,709 | | 100 | %

(a) MWs are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility. Includes owned generating capacity of 579 MWs and long-term power purchase agreements of approximately 3,063 MWs of wind generation that expire in 2028 through 2048. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information.
(b) Includes a long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 60 MWs of hydroelectric generation that expires in 2023.
Evergy's projected peak summer demand for 2020 is approximately 10,367 MWs. Evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for the foreseeable future with its existing generation assets and power and capacity purchases. 
Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are members of the SPP. The SPP is a FERC-approved RTO with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply, adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region. As SPP members, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 12%. This net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership, capacity agreements, power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs. The reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the region's electric supply. 
Environmental Matters 
There have been, and management believes there will continue to be, policy, legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change, such as efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for low-carbon generation and energy efficiency. These efforts, and climate change itself, have the potential to adversely affect the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
The Evergy Companies have taken, and will continue to take, proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses. For example, the Evergy Companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events, including storms, which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change. In addition, the Evergy Companies have invested, and will continue to invest, in grid resiliency. Much of the Evergy Companies' infrastructure is aged, and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines, replacing aged infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems during severe weather. The Evergy Companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion.
Transforming Evergy's Generation Fleet
The Evergy Companies are committed to a long-term strategy to reduce carbon emissions in a cost-effective and reliable manner and are targeting to achieve an 80% reduction of carbon emissions by 2050 from 2005 levels. The trajectory and timing of reaching this goal could be impacted by political, legal and regulatory actions and technological matters. Public attention is currently focused on reducing GHG emissions and closing coal-fired generating units. Diversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits. In addition, the Evergy Companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the Evergy Companies to include in rates and avoid "stranding" assets by prematurely closing facilities. The Evergy Companies use an integrated resource plan, which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and 
10

demand for electricity, to inform the manner in which they supply electricity. The integrated resource plan considers forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response initiatives. Strategies that the Evergy Companies have pursued include:

• | retiring fossil fuel generation;


• | developing renewable energy facilities;


• | collaborating with regulators to offer customers the opportunity to procure electricity produced with renewable resources; and


• | investing in customer energy efficiency programs.

Since 2005, the Evergy Companies have added over 3,500 megawatts of renewables, while retiring more than 2,400 megawatts of fossil generation. The transition of their generation fleet has allowed the Evergy Companies to reduce carbon emissions by almost 40% since 2005. The Evergy Companies are also committed to transparency. On its website, www.evergy.com, Evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental, social and governance matters, including information related to emissions, waste and water. The contents of the website and report are not incorporated into this filing.
See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.
Fuel
The fuel sources for Evergy's owned generation and purchased power agreements are coal, wind and other renewable sources, uranium and natural gas and oil. The actual 2019 fuel mix and fuel cost in cents per net kilowatt hour (kWh) delivered are outlined in the following table.

 | | | | Fuel cost in cents per
 | Fuel Mix(a) | | net kWh delivered (b)
 | Actual | | Actual 
Fuel | 2019 | | 2019 
Coal | 50 | % | | $2.03 
Wind, hydroelectric, landfill gas and solar | 27 | | | 2.36 
Uranium | 18 | | | 0.60 
Natural gas and oil | 5 | | | 2.91 
Total | 100 | % | | $1.94 

(a) Fuel mix based on percent of net MWhs generated by owned resources and delivered under renewable purchased power agreements.
(b) Fuel cost in cents per net kWh delivered includes purchased power costs associated with renewable purchased power agreements.
Coal
During 2020, Evergy's generating units, including jointly-owned units, are projected to use approximately 17 million tons of coal. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have entered into coal-purchase contracts with various suppliers in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), the nation's principal supply region of low-sulfur coal, and with local suppliers. The coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 80% of the projected coal requirements for 2020 and approximately 10% for 2021. The remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through entering into additional contracts or spot market purchases. 
Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the PRB and local suppliers to their generating units. The transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for 2020 and approximately 75% for 2021. The contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs. 
11

Nuclear Fuel
Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro each owns 47% of Wolf Creek, which is Evergy's only nuclear generating unit. Wolf Creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor. This process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium, uranium enrichment and conversion services needed to operate Wolf Creek through 2027. The owners also have under contract all of the uranium fabrication required to operate Wolf Creek through September 2025.
Natural Gas
Evergy purchases natural gas for use in its generating units primarily through spot market purchases. From time to time, Evergy also may enter into contracts, including the use of derivatives, in an effort to manage the cost of natural gas. For additional information about our exposure to commodity price risks, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Evergy Kansas Central maintains natural gas transportation arrangements with Kansas Gas Service and Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline. The Kansas Gas Service arrangement has historically expired on April 30 of each year and is renegotiated for an additional one-year term. The Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline arrangement expires based on the generating unit being served with expiration dates from 2022 to 2030.
