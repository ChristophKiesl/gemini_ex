Refer to Note 3. Business Combinations for further information regarding acquisitions and dispositions.
Raw Materials
Principal materials used in our products for each business segment include electronic and electromechanical components, carbon steel, aluminum, stainless steel, wood and laminates, petroleum-based products, such as foams and plastics, and other materials, majority of our raw material components are available from multiple sources. 
Prices fluctuate for raw materials and sub-assemblies used in our products based on a number of factors beyond our control. Specifically, the fluctuating prices of certain raw materials, including metals, fuel, plastics and electronic components as well as the impact from incremental China tariff had a direct effect on our profitability. Although we generally have not engaged in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases, we have effectively mitigated a portion of the cost pressure through improved operational efficiencies and enhanced supplier management.
Most of our contracts with hospital GPOs and other customers for the sale of products in North America permit us to institute annual list price increases, although we may not always be able to raise prices sufficiently to offset all raw material cost inflation.
Competition
Across our business, we compete on the basis of clinical expertise, resulting product clinical utility and ability to produce favorable patient outcomes, as well as value, quality, customer service, innovation and breadth of product offerings. We evaluate our competition based on our segments. 
The following table displays our significant competitors with respect to each segment:

Additionally, we compete with a large number of smaller and regional manufacturers.
Regulatory Matters
FDA Regulation
We design, manufacture, install and distribute medical devices that are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and similar agencies in other countries. The regulations and standards of these agencies evolve over time and require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance. The FDA’s Quality System regulations and the regulatory equivalents internationally set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities. From time to time, the FDA performs routine inspections of our facilities and may inform us of certain deficiencies in our processes or facilities. In addition, there are certain state and local government requirements that must be complied with in the manufacturing and marketing of our products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information.
Environmental
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental and health and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in, or derived from our manufacturing processes. When necessary, we provide reserves in our financial statements for environmental matters. We do not expect the remediation costs for any environmental issues in which we are currently involved to exceed $1.0 million.
Health Care Regulations
In March 2010, comprehensive health care reform legislation in the United States was signed into law through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. The health care industry continues to undergo significant change, both in response to this law and in response to other legislative and regulatory actions. In addition to health care reform, Medicare, Medicaid and managed care organizations, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations, traditional indemnity insurers and third-party administrators are under 
increasing pressure to control costs and limit utilization, while improving quality and health care outcomes. These objectives are being advanced through a variety of reform initiatives including, but not limited to, accountable care organizations, value-based purchasing, bundling initiatives and competitive bidding programs. We are also subject to a number of other regulations around the world related to the sale and distribution of health care products. The potential impact of these regulations to our business is discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in this Form 10-K.
Product Development
We pursue development of new products and product improvements internally. We maintain professional working relationships with various medical professionals who assist in product research and development. New and improved products play a critical role in our sales growth. We continue to place emphasis on the development of proprietary products and product improvements to complement and expand our existing product lines. Our significant research and development activities are located in Acton, Massachusetts; Batesville, Indiana; Cary, North Carolina; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Skaneateles Falls, New York; Bologna, Italy; Pluvigner, France; Singapore; and Saalfeld and Puchheim, Germany.
Research and development is expensed as incurred. Research and development expense during fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $144.9 million, $136.5 million and $139.5 million.
In addition, certain software development technology costs for software to be sold or licensed to customers are capitalized as intangibles and are amortized over a period of three to five years once the software is ready for its intended use. The amounts capitalized during fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $10.1 million, $15.3 million and $8.0 million.
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Names
We own, and may license from others, a number of patents on our products and manufacturing processes, but we do not believe any single patent or related group of patents is of material significance to any business segment or our business as a whole. We also own a number of trademarks, trade names and service marks relating to our products and services. Except for the marks “HillromTM”, “Hill-Rom®” and “Welch Allyn®”, we do not believe any single trademark, trade name or service mark is of material significance to any business segment or our business as a whole.
Foreign Operations
Information about our foreign operations is set forth in tables relating to geographic information in Note 14. Segment Reporting of our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Human Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2021, Hillrom had approximately 10,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 6,000 employees in the United States and approximately 4,000 employees outside of the United States. Hillrom’s global presence enables our strategic priority of expanding internationally and penetrating emerging markets with our differentiated solutions. Our employees are our most important assets and they set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. All of our employees contribute to Hillrom’s success and, in particular, the employees in our manufacturing, sales, research and development and quality assurance departments are instrumental in driving operational execution and strong financial performance, advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program.
The success and growth of Hillrom’s business depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our global workforce as well as executive officers and other key personnel. To succeed in a competitive labor market, Hillrom has developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives: 
•Competitive Pay and Benefits. Hillrom’s compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with Hillrom’s performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:
◦We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. 
◦We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. 
◦We align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance. 
◦Annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion. 
◦All employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a retirement plan and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, paid parental leave, adoption assistance, a travel solution for nursing moms, family building benefits, prescription savings solutions, Veterans' Health Administration coverage in U.S. medical plans, transgender medical coverage, a personalized wellness program, a financial wellness program and expanded coverage for diabetic employees.
•Advancing and Celebrating Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (“DIB”). DIB is vital to Hillrom’s ability to grow the business and innovate in an ever-changing, fast-paced environment. Our diverse and inclusive workplace encourages different perspectives and ideas, which we believe enables better business decisions and rapid innovation. The following are highlights of Hillrom’s DIB program:
◦We have established a DIB Council that provides strategic direction, guidance and advocacy for Hillrom's DIB initiatives and advancements and is led by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer and includes high-performing leaders from around the world.
◦As of September 30, 2021, women leaders made up 36% of Hillrom’s Board of Directors and 53% of Hillrom’s Executive Leadership Team.
◦We sponsor multiple Employee Resources Groups, which are employee-led and open to all employees, including: Pride Partnership; Individuals with Disabilities Empowered to Achieve; Veteran Employee Team; Embrace—A Black Professional Organization; Professional Women’s Group; HOLA (Hillrom Organization for Latino/a Advancement) and LOTUS (Leadership, Opportunity, Talent, Unity, Successes).
◦We recruit diverse talent through local partnerships with organizations such as RecruitMilitary, HACE (Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement), Diversity Best Practice, NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) focused on individuals with disabilities, NABA (National Association of Black Accountants), 100 Black Men of the Twin Cities and Syracuse, Inc., Chicago Urban League, Imentor and One Million Degrees. In addition, we have formed partnership with several Historically Black Colleges Universities ("HBCU").
Our culture is dynamic, continually evolving and advancing to enable all of our employees the opportunities to realize their best professional selves. Fundamentally, our culture is rooted in a commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging.

•Health and Safety. Health and safety are firmly rooted across Hillrom's global footprint. During fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, Hillrom completed the deployment across its manufacturing facilities of its new environmental health and safety management system, which is designed to streamline data collection, ensure greater consistency and accuracy across global operations and improve health and safety performance. We prioritize, manage and carefully track safety performance at all locations globally and integrate sound safety practices to make a meaningful difference in every facet of our operations. During fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, Hillrom's recordable injury rate increased compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 by 10.5% (0.42 recordable injuries per 100 workers per year) on a company-wide basis and reduced by 18.8% (0.26 recordable injuries per 100 workers per year) across its manufacturing operations. Hillrom reduced its overall recordable injury rate compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 by 19.2%.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation measures, we implemented changes in our business in March 2020 in an effort to protect our employees and customers, and to support appropriate health and safety protocols. For example, we installed physical barriers between employees in production facilities, implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office administration spaces and implemented broad work-from-home initiatives for employees in our administrative functions. While Hillrom’s essential workers (production and field service employees) have continued to work at our facilities and provide vital service to our customers, many employees in our administrative functions have effectively worked remotely since mid-March 2020. We have adapted our processes and used technology to continue to effectively execute on our strategic priorities as well as daily operating activities. A workforce reintegration plan has been established to facilitate a return to the office. The reintegration plan includes safety measures and procedures in compliance with local laws and regulations to ensure a safe work environment for employees that return to the office.
•Labor Relations/Fair Labor Practice. We are committed to equal opportunity employment and working effectively with existing unions. As of September 30, 2021, approximately 8% of our employees in the United States (including contingent workers) worked under collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced a work stoppage in the United States in over 40 years, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory. The two collective bargaining agreements at our primary U.S. manufacturing facility expire in January 2022 and January 2024. We are also subject to various collective bargaining arrangements and/or national trade union agreements outside the United States. As of September 30, 2021, approximately 64% of our employees outside the United States (including contingent workers) worked under such arrangements.
•Recruitment, Training and Development. We use recruitment vehicles to attract diverse talent to our organization, including partnerships with local and national organizations, HBCUs and various social media outlets. Hillrom invests in learning opportunities that foster a growth mindset. Our formal offerings include a tuition reimbursement program, an e-learning platform known as Hillrom University (“HRU”) and virtual workshops that support our culture, strategy and the development of crucial skills. To measure the impact of the investments we make in our people, and to help us continually improve our human resources programs, we regularly track a number of critical metrics, including the following:
◦Internal Hires: We track the percentage of open positions filled with internal candidates and use this metric as a measure of how successfully we are promoting talent from within. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the data was as follows:
▪Director and above: 61%
▪Manager and above: 49%
▪All levels: 33%
◦Employee Satisfaction: We conduct an anonymous bi-annual engagement survey of our global workforce. Administered and analyzed by an independent third-party, the survey results are reviewed by the executive officers. The results of this engagement survey are shared with individual managers, who are then tasked with taking action 
based on their employees’ anonymous feedback (both quantitative and qualitative). By paying close attention to the results both at an aggregate enterprise level as well as at a department/business/work group level, Hillrom has been able to enhance its culture of respect, help educate employees more effectively about our benefits offerings as well as our learning and development opportunities and further improve our communications content, mechanisms and frequency.
