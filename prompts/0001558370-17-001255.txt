 Strategy
 The key elements of our strategy consist of the following:

· | Target Under‑served Markets or Industries Where We Can Compete Successfully. We operate our telecommunications businesses primarily in smaller, rural or under‑served markets where we believe we are or will be one of the leading providers of telecommunications services. Our businesses typically have strong local brand identities and market positions. By leveraging these attributes, along with our lower cost of capital and our senior management expertise at the holding company level, we seek to improve and expand available products and services in our targeted markets to better meet the needs of our customers and expand our customer bases and revenues. We are particularly interested in investing in businesses that have the potential to provide a platform for future organic and strategic growth. Our solar company investments have afforded us entry into an emerging industry in which we believe there are attractive investment return opportunities and the potential to expand our business.

· | Collaborate with Local Management. We believe that strong local management enhances our close relationship with customers and reduces risk. Wherever feasible, we seek to partner with local investors, owners or management teams who have demonstrated a successful track record or have extensive knowledge of the industry. We seek to enhance our strong market position by maintaining these relationships and by leveraging our comprehensive management experience and technical and financial expertise to assist them in further improving operations. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain a Disciplined Earnings‑Oriented Approach. We carefully assess the potential for earnings stability and growth when we evaluate the performance of our subsidiaries, new investment opportunities and prospective acquisitions or dispositions. In managing our more mature businesses, we seek to solidify our brands, improve customer satisfaction, add new services, control costs and preserve cash flow. In

  Acquisitions
 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we completed acquisitions within our International Telecom, Renewable Energy and U.S. Telecom segments (the “2016 Acquisitions”).
     International Telecom
     During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we completed our acquisitions of a controlling interest in One Communications, formerly KeyTech Limited, (the “One Communications Acquisition”) as well as all of the membership interests of Caribbean Asset Holdings LLC, the holding company for the Innovative group of companies ( the “Innovative Acquisition”).
     One Communications (formerly KeyTech Limited)
     On May 3, 2016, we completed our acquisition of a controlling interest in KeyTech Limited (“KeyTech”), a publicly held Bermuda company listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (“BSX”) that provides broadband and cable video services and other telecommunications services to residential and enterprise customers under the “Logic” name in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  Subsequent to the completion of our acquisition of KeyTech, KeyTech changed its name, and the “Logic” name, to One Communications Ltd (“One Communications”).   Prior to our acquisitions, One Communications also owned a minority interest of approximately 43% in the Company’s consolidated subsidiary, Bermuda Digital Communications Ltd. (“BDC”), which provides wireless services in Bermuda under the “CellOne” name. As part of the transaction, the Company contributed its ownership interest of approximately 43% in BDC and approximately $42 million in cash in exchange for a 51% ownership interest in One Communications. As part of the transaction, BDC was merged with and into a company within the One Communications group and the approximate 15% interest in BDC held, in the aggregate, by BDC’s other minority shareholders was converted into the right to receive common shares in One Communications. Following the transaction, BDC became wholly owned by One Communications, and One Communications continues to be listed on the BSX. A portion of the cash proceeds that One Communications received upon closing was used to fund a one-time special dividend to One Communications’ existing shareholders and to retire One Communications subordinated debt. On May 3, 2016, we began consolidating the results of One Communications within our financial statements in our International Telecom segment.
     The One Communications Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination of a controlling interest in One Communications in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, and the acquisition of an incremental ownership interest in BDC in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation.  The total purchase consideration of $41.6 million of cash was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. 
     Innovative
     On July 1, 2016,we completed our acquisition of all of the membership interests of Caribbean Asset Holdings LLC, the holding company for the Innovative group of companies operating video services, Internet, wireless and landline services in the U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands and St. Maarten (“Innovative”), from the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (“CFC”). We acquired the Innovative operations for a contractual purchase price of $145 million, reduced by purchase price adjustments of $4.9 million (the “Innovative Transaction”).  In connection with the transaction, we financed $60 million of the purchase price with a loan from an affiliate of CFC, the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (“RTFC”) on the terms and conditions of a Loan Agreement by and among RTFC, CAH and ATN VI Holdings, LLC, the parent entity of CAH and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  We funded $51.9 million of the purchase price in cash and subsequently paid $22.5 million to fund Innovative’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Following the purchase, our current operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands under the “Choice” name were combined with Innovative to 

 
  4

 
deliver residential and business subscribers a full range of telecommunications and media services.  On July 1, 2016, we began consolidating the results of Innovative within our financial statements in our International Telecom segment.
     The Innovative Transaction was accounted as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805.  The $111.9 million of consideration transferred and used for the purchase price allocation, differed from the contractual purchase price of $145.0 million, due to certain GAAP purchase price adjustments related primarily to changes in working capital of $5.3 million and our agreeing to subsequently settle assumed pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities of $27.8 million.  As of December 31, 2016, we transferred consideration of $111.9 million to the seller that was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.  The final purchase price represents a reduction of $0.4 million from the preliminary purchase price.  The decrease was due to settlement of working capital adjustments.
     Renewable Energy
     Vibrant Energy
 On April 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of a solar power development portfolio in India from Armstrong Energy Global Limited (“Armstrong”), a well-known developer, builder, and owner of solar farms (the “Vibrant Energy Acquisition”). The business operates under the name Vibrant Energy. We also retained several Armstrong employees in the United Kingdom and India who are employed by us to oversee the development, construction and operation of the India solar projects. The projects to be developed initially are located in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and are based on a commercial and industrial business model, similar to our existing renewable energy operations in the United States.  As of April 7, 2016, we began consolidating the results of Vibrant Energy in its financial statements within its Renewable Energy segment.
     The Vibrant Energy Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”).  The total purchase consideration of $6.2 million cash was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition.   
     U.S. Telecom
     In July 2016, we acquired certain telecommunications fixed assets and the associated operations in the western United States.  The acquisition qualified as a business combination for accounting purposes.  We transferred $9.1 million of cash consideration in the acquisition.  The consideration transferred was allocated to $10.2 million of acquired fixed assets, $3.5 million of deferred tax liability, and $0.7 million to other net liabilities, resulting in goodwill of $3.1 million. Results of operations for the business are included in the U.S. Telecom segment and are not material to our historical results of operations. 
      Our Services
 Wireless Services
 We provide mobile wireless voice and data communications services in the United States, Bermuda, Guyana and the Caribbean. Our revenues from wireless services were approximately 50% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2016.  The U.S. portion of our business constitutes a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. Our revenues from U.S. wireless services were approximately 32%, 44%, and 37% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our U.S. wireless service revenues have historically had high operating margins and therefore have contributed a large percentage of operating income. U.S. Telecom Segment
 In the United States, we provide wholesale wireless voice and data roaming services in rural markets to national, regional, local and selected international wireless carriers. Our largest wholesale networks are located 

 
  5

 
principally in the western United States. We also offer wireless voice and data services to retail customers in certain rural markets already covered by our wholesale networks.
 Services. The revenue and profits of our U.S. wholesale wireless business are primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations in operation, the amount of voice and data traffic that each of these sites generates, and the rates we receive from our carrier customers on that traffic. Many of our sites are located in popular tourist and seasonal visitor areas, which has resulted in higher wholesale revenues in those areas during the summer months.
 We currently have roaming agreements with approximately 43 United States‑ based wireless service providers and, as of December 31, 2016, had roaming arrangements with each of the four U.S. national wireless network operators: AT&T, Sprint, T‑Mobile and Verizon Wireless. Other than the agreements with the national carriers, our standard roaming agreements are usually terminable within 90 days.  Occasionally, we may agree or strategically decide to lower rates or build a new mobile network at a specified location as part of a long‑term roaming agreement to offer our roaming partner pricing certainty in exchange for priority designation with respect to their customers’ wireless traffic. Once we complete building a rural network, we then benefit from the use of that network under existing roaming agreements with other international, national, regional, and local carriers to supplement our initial revenues. In 2016, the four national wireless service providers together accounted for a substantial portion of our wholesale wireless revenues, with AT&T and Verizon accounting for 14% and 12% respectively, of our total consolidated revenue for the year.
 Network and Operations. Our roaming network offers mobile communications service through a digital wireless voice and data network that utilizes multiple cellular mobile technologies including UMTS/HSPA, CDMA/EvDO and LTE that often will be deployed at a single cell site location in order to maximize revenue opportunities. We provide wireless communications network products and services with owned and leased spectrum primarily in the 700 megahertz (MHz), 800 megahertz (MHz) and 1900 megahertz (MHz) spectrum ranges.  In 2016, we continued the efforts we began in the 2015 fiscal year to upgrade our cell sites with advanced 4G LTE technology throughout our service areas. Our networks comprise base stations and radio transceivers located on owned or leased towers and buildings, telecommunications switches and owned or leased transport facilities. We design and construct our network in a manner that will provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices. Network reliability is carefully considered and redundancy is employed in many aspects of our network design.
 Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topologies and the use of emergency standby power is used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruptions from any particular network element failure. We operate high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office. Centralized equipment used for network and data management is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy. Our systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network. Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology over fiber or microwave links for virtually all of our 4G LTE sites.  
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated a total of approximately 1,000 domestic base stations on nearly 540 owned and leased sites, a Network Operations Center (or “NOC”), a switching center, and presence in numerous leased data centers designed to support network virtualization and provide network resiliency. Our NOC provides dedicated, 24‑hour, year‑round monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers. In 2016, we continued to expand and improve our network, adding nearly 130 new base stations and approximately 25 new sites and upgraded approximately 100 sites to more advanced 4G LTE data technology.
 Competition. We compete with wireless service providers that operate networks in our markets and offer wholesale roaming services. However, the most significant competitive challenge we face in our U.S. wholesale wireless business is the extent to which our carrier customers choose not to roam on our networks or elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure in a market in which we operate, reducing or eliminating their need for our services in those markets.  We address this competitive threat mainly by providing a service that would be more costly for the carrier to provide itself, or, at least, a less attractive expenditure than alternative investments in its network or business elsewhere.

 Occasionally, we have entered into buildout projects with existing carrier customers to help the customer accelerate the buildout of a given area. Pursuant to these arrangements, we agree to incur the cost of building and operating a network in a newly designated area meeting specified conditions. In exchange, the carrier agrees to license us spectrum in that area and enter into a contract with specific pricing and term. These arrangements typically include a purchase right in favor of the carrier to purchase that portion of the network, depending on when the option to purchase is exercised. For example, as previously disclosed in December 2012, we sold a portion of our network to a carrier customer pursuant to an option contained in a roaming and buildout agreement with that carrier. We currently have one buildout arrangement of approximately 100 built cell sites that provides the carrier with an option to purchase such sites, which option is exercisable beginning in 2018. This portion of our network accounted for approximately $13.4 million in wholesale revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. At this time, we believe the holder is likely to exercise the option and proceeds from the exercise to be minimal.
 Our ability to maintain appropriate capacity and relevant technology to respond to our roaming partners’ needs also shapes our competitive profile in the markets in which we operate.  We believe that currently available technologies and appropriate capital additions will allow sufficient capacity on our networks to meet anticipated demand for voice and data services over the next few years. However, increasing demand for high-speed data may require the acquisition of additional spectrum licenses to provide sufficient capacity and throughput.
 International Telecom Segment
 We provide wireless voice and data service to retail and business customers in Bermuda under the “One” name, in Guyana under the “GTT” name and in the U.S. Virgin Islands under the “Innovative” and “Choice” brand names. We also provide roaming services for many of the largest U.S. providers’ customers visiting these locations. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 312,000 wireless subscribers in our International Telecom segment.  As of December 31, 2016, more than 86% of our wireless subscribers were on prepaid plans.
 Products and Services. In Bermuda, a majority of our customers subscribe to one of our postpaid plans, which allow customers to select a plan with a given amount of voice minutes, text messaging, data and other features that recur on a monthly basis. In Guyana, nearly all of our customers (approximately 96%) and, in our other markets, a substantial majority of our customers, subscribe to our prepaid plans, which require customers to purchase an amount of voice minutes, text messages or data prior to use. In the U.S. Virgin Islands and other international markets, we also provide Internet access services via a variety of wireless and wireline broadband technologies. 
 Network. We currently operate multiple advanced wireless voice and data technologies in our international markets in the 850, 900, 1800, 1900 and 2500 MHz frequency bands, including GSM/EDGE, UMTS/HSPA+ and CDMA/EVDO and we added LTE technology in certain of our markets in 2016. We have extensive backbone facilities linking our sites, switching facilities and international interconnection points. Off‑island connectivity is provided by leased and owned fiber‑based interconnections.
 Sales and Marketing. We maintain retail stores in our markets and allow customers to pay their bills and “top up”, or add additional minutes to their prepaid plans, through payment terminals at local stores, business centers or our website or, by purchase of prepaid calling cards, or via mobile or web-based apps. We advertise frequently through print and electronic media, radio station spots and sponsor various events and initiatives.  Our handsets, prepaid cards and prepaid accounts are also sold through independent dealers that we pay on a commission basis.
 Handsets and Accessories. We offer a diverse line‑up of wireless devices and accessories designed to meet both the personal and professional needs of our customers. Our device assortment includes a wide range of smartphones including those featuring the Android and IOS operating systems in addition to a full line of feature phones, wireless hot spots and various wireless solutions for small businesses. To complement our phone offerings, we sell a complete range of original equipment manufacturer and after‑market accessories that allow our customers to personalize their wireless experience, including phone protection, battery charging solutions and Bluetooth hands‑free kits.
 Competition. We believe we compete for wireless retail customers in our international properties based on features, price, technology deployed, network coverage (including through roaming arrangements), quality of service 

 
  7

 
and customer care. We compete against Digicel, which is a large mobile telecommunications company in the Caribbean region, and in some markets, against one or more U.S. national operators or the wireless division of the incumbent telephone companies.

Wireline Services
 Our wireline services include operations in Guyana, Bermuda, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and the mainland United States. Our revenues from wireline services were approximately 41%, 25% and 29% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. International Telecom Segment
 Voice services. We offer voice services that include local exchange, regional and long distance calling and voice messaging services in Bermuda, Guyana, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and in other smaller markets in the Caribbean and the United States.  As of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate of approximately 180,000 access lines in service in our markets, which represent both residential and commercial subscribers. Across our businesses, residential customers account for approximately three-quarters of the wireline local telephone service revenue while commercial customers account for approximately one‑quarter. 
 In Guyana, we are the exclusive licensed provider of domestic wireline local and long‑distance telephone services into and out of the country and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, we are the incumbent local exchange carrier and sole fixed telephony provider. With respect to our international long‑distance business, we also collect payments from foreign carriers for handling international long‑distance calls originating from the foreign carriers’ country and terminating on our network. We also make payments to foreign carriers for international calls originating on one of our networks and terminating in the foreign carrier’s country and collect from our subscribers or a local originating carrier a rate that is market based or set by regulatory tariff.
     Internet services. We offer high-speed Internet services with varying speeds to address different customer needs and price requirements in our various markets. Internet services accounted for 16.6% of our revenues in our International Telecom segment in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 97,000 Internet customers across our markets.
 Video services. We also offer video service over our co-axial cable and fiber-optic networks in our international markets. In the U.S. Virgin Islands we are the only authorized video services operator and are the sole provider of video services to customers in Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands.  From July 1, 2016 through January 3, 2017, we also provided cable TV services in St. Maarten. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 61,000 video customers across our markets.  We have several offerings available to our video customers, including basic and tiered local and cable TV channels grouped into various content categories, such as news, sports and entertainment.
     Network. All of our fixed access lines are digitally switched from our switching centers in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guyana. Our switching centers provide dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers.
     In the U.S. Virgin Islands, we deliver our services via a hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) cable network and continue to transition  our traditional copper network to our voice, video and data services on this network.  The HFC network gives us expanded Internet access coverage to more than 95% of homes passed in the U.S. Virgin Islands with speeds up to 100 Mbps for residential customers. In 2016, we began migrating our existing fixed wireless internet customers in the U.S. Virgin Islands network to the HFC network, and expect to be able to offer faster, more reliable voice, data and internet services to customers in the U.S. Virgin Islands as compared to our previous fixed wireless network.
     Our international voice and data networks are linked with the rest of the world principally through undersea fiber‑optic cables. In Guyana we co‑own the Suriname‑Guyana Submarine Cable System with Telesur, the government‑owned telecommunications provider in Suriname, that provides us with more robust redundancy, the 

 
  8

 
capacity to meet growing data demands in Guyana, and the opportunity to provide new and enhanced IP centric services such as Internet service. We also lease capacity on certain satellites to provide both international and local backhaul services.
 Sales and Marketing. Our businesses utilize four key sales channels: stores, telesales, business-to-business (“B2B”) channels and residential sales (inbound). The telesales department makes outbound calls to existing customers to promote bundling and other upgrade opportunities and our B2B sales channel focuses on selling data and voice products to business and government accounts.  Certain residential sales are made through inbound communications to customer service representatives who assist with a wide range of inquiries and sell different product offerings to help retain customers or improve their service with upgrades or bundles.  Our revenues for our wireline services are derived from installation charges for new lines, monthly line charges, data and video services and value added services, such as hosting or enterprise voice and data solutions. For our voice wireline services, rates differ for residential and commercial customers and in certain markets, may be set by regulatory authorities. 
 Competition. We compete with a limited number of other providers for various products, including Digicel. In 2016, we acquired our wireline businesses in Bermuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands in order to provide us with greater scale in those markets and the capability to offer a “quad play” of connectivity: high speed internet, mobility, video and voice services. We expect our competition in Bermuda to seek to match that capability. Nonetheless, we believe this breadth of services and economies of scale will provide us with a strong competitive position and the ability to win and retain an economically viable share of those markets.
 In Guyana, we have the exclusive right to provide domestic fixed and international voice and data services. As the initial term of our license was scheduled to expire in December 2010, we notified the Government of Guyana of our election to renew our exclusive license for an additional 20 year term expiring in 2030 and received return correspondence from the Government that our exclusive license had been renewed until such time that new legislation is implemented with regard to the Government’s intention to introduce competition into the sector. We believe, however, our exclusive license continues to be valid unless and until such time as we enter into an alternative agreement with the Government. See “—Guyana Regulation—Regulatory Developments” and “Risk Factors—Our exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in Guyana is subject to significant political and regulatory risk.”
 U.S. Telecom Segment
 Network. We provide voice and data services using a network comprising telecommunications switching and related equipment that we own and telecommunications lines that we typically leased from the incumbent telephone company. We operate high capacity fiber‑optic ring networks in Vermont and New York State that we use to connect our enterprise markets and to provide wholesale data transport services to other carriers. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 434,000 business and 6,000 residential access line equivalents (“ALEs”), in billing. ALEs are calculated by determining the number of individual voice or data lines, in 64 kbps segments, that generate a monthly recurring charge within an end user circuit or circuits. As of December 31, 2016, we also provided broadband services to approximately 3,600 accounts in Vermont and western New Hampshire.
 Sales and Marketing. We sell our services primarily through a direct sales force that assists customers in choosing tailored solutions for their specific communication needs. Our direct sales staff focuses on selling integrated voice and data to small and medium‑sized businesses and other organizations, while residential services are largely sold through advertising and word of mouth. We advertise on television and radio through cooperative arrangements and engage in other promotional activities from time to time.
 Our wholesale transport and capacity customers are predominately telecommunications carriers such as local exchange carriers, wireless carriers and interstate integrated providers, which were served by our direct sales force. 
 Competition. We competed for retail customers by offering customized voice and data solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our two targeted subsets of customers by providing superior customer service and competitive pricing. Our primary retail competitor is Fairpoint Communications, which acquired the incumbent local exchange 

 
  9

 
business of Verizon Communications in northern New England. We also compete with cable companies, such as Comcast, and other competitive service providers who target small and medium sized businesses. Our wholesale competitors include Level 3 and Verizon Communications, other regional wholesale providers and cable television companies that operate fiber‑optic networks.
 During June 2016, as a result of recent industry consolidation activities and a review of strategic alternatives for the Company’s U.S. Wireline business in the Northeast, the Company identified factors indicating the carrying amount of certain assets may not be recoverable.  More specifically, the factors included the competitive environment, recent industry consolidation, and the Company’s view of future opportunities in the market that began to evolve in the second quarter of 2016.   
    
On August 8, 2016, we announced that we entered into an agreement to sell our U.S. Wireline business in the Northeast, including our integrated voice and data operations in New England and our wholesale transport operations in New York.  Following the completion of the sale, we will retain our wholesale long-distance business in our U.S. Telecom segment.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter 2017, following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
 Renewable Energy Services
 Domestic
 On December 24, 2014, we acquired a provider of distributed generation solar power services in the United States, specifically in Massachusetts, California and New Jersey (the “Ahana Acquisition”). As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 28 commercial solar projects at 59 sites (each, a “Facility”) with an aggregate 45.8 megawatts DC peak (“MWp”) of electricity generating capacity. We own the Facilities through various indirect subsidiaries that were formed for the purpose of financing the development of, and owning and operating, the Facilities (the “Special Purpose Entities”).
 Services. Generally, our solar projects are in the “commercial and industrial” (“C&I”) sector of the solar market, which is distinguished from utilities and residential customers. Our customers or “offtakers” include high‑credit quality corporates, utilities, schools, and municipalities, which purchase electricity from us under the terms of long‑term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”). Each Facility is built on the customer’s owned or leased site and reduces the customer’s dependence on traditional energy suppliers, thereby mitigating the price volatility often associated with traditional energy suppliers and transmissions systems. Our PPA terms range from ten to twenty‑five years in duration and are typically priced at or below then-prevailing local retail electricity rates, allowing the customer to secure electricity at predictable and stable prices over the duration of their long‑term contract. As such, the PPAs provide us with high‑quality contracted cash flows, which will continue over their average remaining life, weighted by MWp, of 12.5 years as of December 31, 2016. Certain of our PPAs provide for early termination for a variety of reasons, including in the event that (a) an offtaker is unable to appropriate funds from state and local governments, (b) there is a change of law that substantially reduces the value of utility credits, (c) termination for convenience, or (d) the Facility causes damage to the premises or roof and our customer fails to repair or causes the customer to be in violation of law, or the customer ceases to hold tenancy or fee interest in the premises. All of our Facilities have been in commercial operation for at least three years and are substantially located as follows:

 | Number of | Total Capacity

  In developing each solar project, we facilitate the project’s design, development and construction and obtain project‑level financing, and we take a controlling interest in the Special Purpose Entity that owns the project Facility in 

 
  10

 
exchange for a PPA. Our solar projects may be financed using a combination of tax equity, bank financing that we secure and our cash on hand. A substantial majority of our acquired Facilities received tax equity financing, pursuant to which third party investors hold equity in the Special Purpose Entities that were formed to finance the development of, and own and operate, such Facilities. In return, the tax equity investors receive a preferred return on their investment up to a contractually agreed amount and the benefits of various tax credits those Facilities generate. Of these projects, approximately one-third of our acquired Facilities are still subject to tax equity financing and will be subject to the payment of preferred returns to our tax equity partners until late 2018. In addition, the Facilities located in California receive revenue from performance based incentive payments (“PBIs”) and those located in Massachusetts and New Jersey receive revenue from the sale of solar renewable energy credit (“SREC”) contracts, which revenue we retain as the Facilities’ operator. In the future, we intend to focus on growing our project portfolio through additional investments with favorable credit quality offtakers in markets that offer favorable government policies to encourage renewable energy projects and where our projects can generate electricity at a cost that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from traditional energy sources.
 We contract with utilities through an interconnection agreement to export excess energy generated by our Facilities to another offtaker and/or the utility electrical grid.
 Infrastructure.
 Our existing Facilities are comprised of rooftop, ground‑mounted and elevated solar support structure photovoltaic (“PV”) installations. Our Facilities are located on our customers’ buildings, parking structures, landfill sites and other locations pursuant to leases or easements granted to us by our customers. These Facilities use crystalline silicon PV modules mounted in ballasted, tracking or roof penetrating fixed‑tilt configurations. All of our existing Facilities were designed, engineered and constructed by Borrego Solar Systems, Inc. (“Borrego”), a former sister company of our acquired solar operations, pursuant to engineering, procurement and construction, or “EPC”, agreements. Borrego now also maintains our Facilities at a committed fee through long‑term Operations and Maintenance Agreements (“O&M Agreements”). Each O&M Agreement commits Borrego to provide maintenance of a Facility for ten years after such Facility is placed in service, including systems monitoring and troubleshooting, inspection, preventative maintenance and any other services on an as‑needed basis at our request at an additional cost.
 We are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for the PV modules that we purchase for installation at our Facilities, with the majority of Facilities constructed with PV modules supplied by Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited, a Chinese company that sources cells from Taiwanese manufacturers and assembles them in China. Typically, the PV modules carry materials and workmanship warranties from 5‑10 years in duration, with power warranties for a 25‑year useful life.
 Competition.
 We compete with the traditional electric power industry, as well as with other solar energy companies that may have greater financial resources or brand name recognition than we do, disadvantaging our ability to attract new customers. The solar energy industry is highly competitive and continually evolving and as such, we expect to compete for future project opportunities with new entrants as well. We believe that we compete with the traditional utilities primarily based on price and the predictability of that price, while we compete with other solar energy providers based on our ability to structure the development and financing of a project for our potential customers or developers on favorable terms. International
 On April 7, 2016, we acquired a solar power development portfolio in India and since that time, have been constructing distributed generation solar power projects in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana based on a commercial and industrial business model, similar to our domestic renewable energy operations. In November 2016, we connected the first 4.9 megawatts DC peak (“MWp”) of our first project to the grid in Andhra Pradesh and since that time, have been banking the energy exported without generating any revenue as of December 31, 2016. As of February 28, 2017, we have five solar farms (each a “Facility”) at five separate sites.  In addition to the 4.9 MWp that is already 

 
  11

 
injecting energy to the grid, we have a further 36 MWp under construction and 22 MWp where we have completed the construction and are now awaiting approval to evacuate electricity to the local grid.  Together, we expect these five Facilities to have a total installed capacity of 63 MWp by the third quarter of 2017.  
 We currently target having 100 MWp operational by the end of 2017 and 250-300 MWp operational by the end of 2018, although that could change as we refine our strategy and respond to the market.  Solar projects are capital intensive and the greatest challenge to achieving these goals is our ability to secure third party debt to fund the installation of the additional capacity.  Our ability to achieve these goals will also depend on, among other things, our ability to acquire the required land for the new capacity, our ability to secure agreements to sell the power on terms that our financing sources consider to be bankable, our willingness to compete with local solar businesses who may be willing to build projects with a lower risk/return profile than ours, and the need to further strengthen our systems and processes to manage the ensuing growth opportunities. For a discussion of the risks associated with executing our short and long term growth plans in India, see “Risk Factors—India Operations.” 
 Market Opportunity.
     India has issued ambitious plans for the development and production of solar energy, with a goal of 100 gigawatts DC peak (“GWp”) by 2022 (as compared to 8.7 GWp installed in India as of October 31, 2016).  There has historically been a close correlation between the growth in India’s gross domestic product and its installed electricity generating base, and we expect this to continue for the next few years to come.  India’s ambitious economic growth plans are therefore expected to be dependent on access to reliable and affordable electricity.  India is a country where many regions currently have significant supply deficits at periods of peak demand, resulting in both industrial and commercial consumers, and households having to suffer either regular power cuts or to make their own arrangements for backup power. 
     Given these macroeconomic factors, solar power is an attractive option for meeting India’s energy requirements. This has been recognized by both the central Government and state Governments across India, many of whom have introduced ambitious targets for the installation of solar power and differing regulatory support mechanisms, without the need to provide  the direct governmental subsidies that have been required in other countries for production of solar energy at this scale.
 The following trends have made India an attractive investment opportunity for our Renewable Energy business:
    
• | Speed of deployment. In India, as in other countries, the development and construction periods for large scale conventional power plants (nuclear, coal and gas) are typically very long, with the period from commencing development to starting to generate power likely to be between five to ten years. This is a challenge for a country which is in need of massive investment in new generation capacity. By contrast, a large scale solar farm can potentially be operational within 12 – 18 months of commencing development. 
• | Cost competitiveness. The installation cost of solar projects in India have continued to fall sharply since we made our initial investment in April 2016, driven in large part by the continued decrease in cost of solar panels. While the rate of such price reductions is likely to slow in the future, we currently expect the cost of installation to continue to fall in the next five to ten years, albeit at a slower pace. We also expect that the cost of debt for solar projects in India will decrease in the next five to ten years, as it has done in other countries. These factors will make the price at which solar farms are able to supply electricity ever more cost competitive with conventional forms of power generation. We are now able to sell the electricity that we generate to potential commercial and industrial customers at a discount to the price that they would otherwise purchase electricity from the grid. 

 
  12

 

• | Balance of payments and energy security. The majority of India’s electricity generating capacity is currently coal. Much of the coal used in these power stations is imported and purchased in foreign currencies, resulting in significant exposure of the Indian electricity sector to movements in the cost of raw materials and currency fluctuations. Solar plans require no raw materials to operate once installed and so have a much lower long-term risk profile compared with conventional sources of power generation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Massive demand for new generation capacity. India requires massive investment in its electricity sector to power its economic growth. Despite recently overtaking China as the fastest growing major economy in the world, India’s installed electricity generation capacity is still a fraction of that of China. To maintain high rates of economic growth through increased industrialization, India will require massive investment in new electricity generation capacity. Despite adding 112GWp in the past five years, many parts of India continue to suffer persistent demand/supply mismatch with a five-year average energy deficit of approximately 7% and a five-year average peak deficit of approximately 8% according to the Ministry of Power. 


• | Strong government support. In order to reduce dependence on energy imports and curtail the current trade deficit and resulting impact on the rupee, the Indian government has taken a number of steps to incentivize the use of renewable sources of energy, including establishing state-level renewable power purchase obligations and tax breaks for the import of solar equipment and modules.


• | Environmental viability. India is known for its dry, sunny weather – ideal for the generation of solar energy. India ranks among the highest irradiation-receiving countries in the world with more than 300 days of sunshine per year in much of the country and the resource is widely available throughout the country. In addition, as solar plants can be built near the point of consumption, power produced generally does not incur expensive transmission charges or require infrastructure or transmission investments. By contrast, conventional power plants such as coal and nuclear may face mid to long-term challenges to their viability due to the need for massive amounts of water for cooling these facilities. Recently, reports in India have circulated that some coal power plants have suspended operations during periods of heat due to the lack of available water for cooling. 

          We consider India to be an attractive market for solar power without the need to rely on governmental subsidies.  This is in contrast with most countries, including the United States, where the mass deployment of solar power and other forms of renewable energy has required, and continues to require, some form of governmental support (either through direct subsidy or tax breaks) to be economically viable.  While we currently expect the landscape for solar power to change over time in India, and potentially materially as the market matures, we believe that the core principal behind our investment in our Indian solar business - that solar power can compete with fossil fuels on a level playing field for the long-term - remains valid.  Indeed, adverse regulatory change is likely to be the primary reason why this would change in the future, and we currently consider the risk of such adverse regulatory change to be low given the country’s fundamental requirement for new electricity generation capacity. 
 Services. We own our Facilities through various indirect subsidiaries that were formed for the purpose of financing the development of, and owning and operating, the Facilities (the “Special Purpose Entities”).  We expect our initial Facilities to sell electricity to commercial and industrial (“C&I”) customers as we establish our business, although in time we may diversify our customer base to also sell power to state utility companies.  We do not expect to sell power directly to residential customers. Our target C&I customers or “offtakers” for our initial Facilities are high‑credit quality corporates, including banks, manufacturers, hotel groups, and hospital groups, which purchase electricity from us under the terms of PPAs. The PPA terms agreed upon with our initial customer base are typically five years in duration and priced below the rate that the customer is currently purchasing electricity from the grid, with annual paid escalators, allowing such customer to secure electricity at predictable and stable prices over the duration of their long‑term contract. As such, the PPAs provide us with high‑quality contracted cash flows, which will continue over their average remaining life.  Our PPAs typically have penalties for the non-delivery of power and as such, we typically try to enter into binding PPAs late in the development process when the connection date of the solar farm can be predicted with greater 

 
  13

 
confidence. Current regulations allow us to sell power to any commercial or industrial customer within 500 kilometers of our grid connection. Currently, we have approximately 30 MWp committed, meaning the aggregate megawatt rated capacity of solar power plants pursuant to such PPAs is signed or allotted but not yet commissioned and operational as of the reporting date. As of December 31, 2016, we began banking power to the grid, but had not yet derived any revenue pursuant to existing PPAs. Our Facilities are located as follows:

 | Number of | Total Capacity
State | Facilities | (MW‑DC) 
 | | Built | Under Construction
Andhra Pradesh | 5 | 4.9 | 35 
Telengana | | | 22 
Total | 5 | 4.9 | 57 

  In developing each solar project, we hire third party engineering and procurement contractors to design and construct our Facilities and actively manage their performance through our in-house technical and quality assurance team.  Our in-house team is also responsible for sourcing and purchasing our material equipment items, such as solar panels and inverters.  We have constructed our Facilities with mostly equity and intercompany debt and following the completion of construction, intend to finance each Facility to raise the funds to construct additional Facilities in 2017.  While we intend to continue to focus our operations on attracting a C&I customer base, in the future we may also consider selling power to state utility companies to enable the Company to expand its installed operating base more quickly.

Our local, in house staff also provides us with the expertise to provide additional revenue from Operations & Maintenance (“O&M”) agreements that we have entered into with third parties for the maintenance, development and construction oversight of other solar power projects owned by such third parties in India.  Currently, our team is focused on supporting the construction of our own projects in India, however, may look in the future to engage in support for additional third parties to produce additional management and O&M revenue for our Company.
 Infrastructure.
 Our existing Facilities are comprised of ground‑mounted  solar photovoltaic (“PV”) installations.  The majority of our Facilities are single-axis tracking systems to increase the generating capability of our Facilities.  Our Facilities are located on land that we have purchased from local owners and will continue to own throughout the duration of each project. Our team in India executes a rigorous due diligence process with respect to any land that we seek to purchase for construction of a project, attempting to minimize the risks typically associated with land purchase and ownership in India. For a more detailed discussion of the risks associated with land procurement and ownership in India, see “Risk Factors—India Operations.”
 All of our existing Facilities were designed, engineered and constructed by KEC International Limited (“KEC”), a global power infrastructure engineering and construction firm, pursuant to engineering, procurement and construction, or “EPC”, agreements. We maintain our Facilities ourselves and have staff employed – both in our corporate office in Hyderabad and at each of our Facilities - who provide year-round maintenance, systems monitoring and troubleshooting, inspection, preventative maintenance and any other services on an as‑needed basis for each of our projects.
 We depend on a limited number of key suppliers for the PV modules that we purchase for installation at our Facilities, with the majority of Facilities constructed with PV modules supplied by GCL System Integration Technology Limited, a Chinese company. Typically, the PV modules carry materials and workmanship warranties of 10 years in duration, with power warranties for a 25‑year useful life.

 Competition.
 We compete with the traditional electric power industry; however, our primary competitors are other solar energy companies that may have greater financial resources or brand name recognition than we do, disadvantaging our ability to attract new customers. The solar energy industry is highly competitive and there are low barriers to entry for companies with sufficient financial resources.  The market is continually evolving, as demonstrated by the ever-decreasing prices tendered in India utility power auctions during 2016, and as such, we expect new entrants to the market as it continues to evolve. However, we believe that the availability of expansion capital from third party financing sources, rather than competition from third parties, is the major risk factor that inhibits our achieving our near-term goals for our Renewable Energy segment. Over the longer term, some of our competitors may have advantages over us in terms of larger size, access to expansion capital,  internal access to solar panels and greater operational, financial, technical, management, lower cost of capital or other resources. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — We face significant competition from traditional and renewable energy companies.” Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,800 employees, of whom approximately 800 were employed in the United States (including in the U.S. Virgin Islands). At the holding company level, we employ our executive management team and staff. Approximately half of our Guyana and U.S. Virgin Island full‑time work forces are represented by unions. In addition, approximately 20% of our Bermuda fulltime workforce is also represented by unions. We believe we have good relations with our employees.Regulation
 Telecom Regulation
 Our wireless and wireline operations and our video services operations in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands are governed by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (or “Communications Act”), the implementing regulations adopted thereunder by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), judicial and regulatory decisions interpreting and implementing the Communications Act, and other federal statutes.  U.S. Federal Regulation
 Our wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services. The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal, state, local, and foreign regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future and legislative or regulatory requirements may be adopted by those jurisdictions that currently have none. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that would adversely affect our operating results. Wireless Services
 The FCC regulates, among other things; the licensed and unlicensed use of radio spectrum; the ownership, lease, transfer of control and assignment of wireless licenses; the ongoing technical, operational and service requirements applicable to such licenses; the timing, nature and scope of network construction; the provision of certain services, such as E‑911; and the interconnection of communications networks in the United States.
 Licenses. We provide our wireless services under various commercial mobile radio services (or “CMRS”) licenses, such as cellular, broadband Personal Communications Services (or “PCS”) or 700 MHz licenses, Advanced Wireless Service (or “AWS”), and Broadband Radio Service (or “BRS”) licenses granted by the FCC, pursuant to special temporary authority (or “STA”) to use certain BRS spectrum for which we do not hold a license, and pursuant to leases of spectrum from FCC‑licensed operators. Some of these licenses and STAs are site‑ based while others cover specified geographic market areas, typically Cellular Market Areas (or “CMAs”) and Basic Trading Areas (or “BTAs”), 

 
  15

 
as defined by the FCC. The technical and service rules, the specific radio frequencies and the authorized spectrum amounts vary depending on the licensed service. The FCC generally allocates CMRS licenses through periodic auctions, after determining how many licenses to make available in particular frequency ranges, the applicable service rules, and the terms on which the license auction will be conducted. Such licenses are also available via secondary market mechanisms, using procedures and regulations set forth by the FCC. There is no certainty as to when additional spectrum will be made available for wireless broadband services, the amount of spectrum that might ultimately be made available, the timing of the auction of any such spectrum, the likely configuration of any such additional spectrum and conditions that might apply to it, or the usability of any of this spectrum for wireless services competitive with our services or by us.
 Construction Obligations. The FCC conditions licenses on the satisfaction of certain obligations to construct networks covering a specified geographic area or population by specific dates. The obligations vary depending on the licensed service. Failure to satisfy an applicable construction requirement can result in the assessment of fines and forfeitures by the FCC, a reduced license term, or automatic license cancellation. We are substantially in compliance with the applicable construction requirements that have arisen for the licenses we currently hold and expect to meet our future construction requirements as well. If we fail to meet the build out requirements by the end of the license term for any individual 700 MHz license, we will lose our authority to serve any unserved area within that particular 700 MHz licensed area and also could be subject to fines and forfeitures, including a revocation of that particular 700 MHz licenses. We currently have met the build out or waiver requirements with respect to that particular 700 MHz licenses except one license as to which we are pursuing a timely – filed waiver request.
 With respect to some of our licenses, if we were to discontinue operation of a wireless system for a period of time, (at least 90 consecutive days for cellular licenses), our license for that area would be automatically forfeited.
 License Renewals. Our FCC licenses generally expire between 2017 and 2022 and are renewable upon application to the FCC. License renewal applications may be denied if the FCC determines, after appropriate notice and hearing, that renewal would not serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity. At the time of renewal, if we can demonstrate that we have provided “substantial” service during the past license term and have complied with the Communications Act and applicable FCC rules and policies, then the FCC will award a renewal expectancy to us and will generally renew our existing licenses without considering any competing applications. The FCC defines “substantial” service as service that is sound, favorable and substantially above a level of mediocre service that might only minimally warrant renewal. If we do not receive a renewal expectancy, then the FCC will accept competing applications for the license and conduct a comparative hearing. In that situation, the FCC may award the license to another applicant. While our licenses have been renewed regularly by the FCC in the past, there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future.
 In 2011, the FCC, in a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (“NPRM”), proposed to establish more consistent requirements for the renewal of licenses, uniform policies governing discontinuances of service, and to clarify certain construction obligations across all of the wireless service bands. The proposed changes to the applicable renewal and discontinuance of service requirements may be applied to existing licenses that will be renewed in the future. This process remains pending.  We are unable to predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of this wireless renewal standards proceeding.
 The FCC may deny license applications and, in extreme cases, revoke licenses if it finds that an entity lacks the requisite qualifications to be a licensee. In making that determination, the FCC considers whether an applicant or licensee has been the subject of adverse findings in a judicial or administrative proceeding involving felonies, the possession or sale of unlawful drugs, fraud, antitrust violations, or unfair competition, employment discrimination, misrepresentations to the FCC or other government agencies, or serious violations of the Communications Act or FCC regulations. To our knowledge, there are no activities and no judicial or administrative proceedings involving either us or the licensees in which we hold a controlling interest that would warrant such a finding by the FCC.
 License Acquisitions. Prior FCC approval typically is required for transfers or assignments of a controlling interest in any license or construction permit, or of any rights thereunder. The FCC may approve or prohibit such transactions altogether, or approve subject to certain conditions such as divestitures or other requirements. 

 
  16

 
Non‑controlling minority interests in an entity that holds an FCC license generally may be bought or sold without FCC approval, subject to any applicable FCC notification requirements. The FCC permits licensees to lease spectrum to third parties under certain conditions, subject to prior FCC approval, or in some instances, notification to the FCC. These mechanisms provide additional flexibility for wireless providers to structure transactions and create additional business and investment opportunities.
 The FCC no longer caps the amount of CMRS spectrum in which an entity may hold an attributable interest and now engages in a case‑by‑case review of proposed wireless transactions, including spectrum acquired via auction, to ensure that the proposed transaction serves the public interest and would not result in a rule violation or an undue concentration of market power.
 In reviewing proposed transactions that involve the transfer or assignment of mobile wireless spectrum, the FCC utilizes a spectrum aggregation screen to determine whether the transaction requires additional scrutiny. The FCC in June 2014 adopted an Order which updated the spectrum screen that the FCC uses in order to conduct its competitive review of proposed secondary market transactions. The FCC’s Order continued the FCC’s policy of conducting a case‑by‑case analysis of a combined entity’s spectrum screen holdings for proposed transactions, revised its existing spectrum screen to reflect the current suitability and availability of spectrum for mobile wireless services, and adopted certain limitations with respect to the purchase and transfer of 600 MHz spectrum. A transaction will trigger additional FCC scrutiny if it will result in the geographic overlap of CMRS spectrum in a given area that is equal to or in excess of 141 MHz, 163.5 MHz, 171 MHz, or 194 MHz, depending on the availability of BRS and AWS spectrum in an overlap area. A transaction will also be reviewed by the FCC with heightened scrutiny if it will result in the resulting entity having over 45 MHz of spectrum under 1 GHz. The FCC’s additional scrutiny would also be triggered if a proposed transaction results in a material change in the post‑transaction market share in a particular market as measured by the Herfindahl‑Hirschman Index. We are well below the spectrum aggregation screen in the majority of geographic areas in which we hold or have access to licenses, and thus we may be able to acquire additional spectrum either from the FCC in an auction or from third parties in private transactions in most locations in which we operate. Similarly, our competitors may be able to strengthen their operations by making additional acquisitions of spectrum in our markets or by further consolidating the industry. 
 Other Requirements. The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules impose a number of additional requirements upon wireless service providers. A failure to meet or maintain compliance with the Communications Act and/or the FCC’s rules may subject us to fines, forfeitures, penalties or other sanctions.
 Wireless licensees must satisfy a variety of FCC requirements relating to technical and reporting matters. Licensees must often coordinate frequency usage with adjacent licensees and permittees to avoid interference between adjacent systems. In addition, the height and power of transmitting facilities and the type of signals emitted must fall within specified parameters. For certain licensed services, a variety of incumbent government and non‑government operations may have to be relocated before a licensee may commence operations, which may trigger the payment of relocation costs by the incoming licensee.
 The radio systems towers that we own and lease are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations that govern the location, marking, lighting, and construction of towers and are subject to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and other environmental statutes enforced by the FCC. The FCC has also adopted guidelines and methods for evaluating human exposure to radio frequency emissions from radio equipment. We believe that all of our radio systems on towers that we own or lease comply in all material respects with these requirements, guidelines, and methods.
 The FCC has adopted requirements for cellular, PCS and other CMRS providers to implement basic and enhanced 911, or E‑911, services. These services provide state and local emergency service providers with the ability to better identify and locate 911 callers using wireless services, including callers using special devices for the hearing impaired. Because the implementation of these obligations requires that the local emergency services provider have certain facilities available, our specific obligations are set on a market‑by‑ market basis as emergency service providers request the implementation of E‑ 911 services within their locales. As part of an E‑911 initiative, the FCC adopted stronger rules regarding E‑911 location accuracy. The extent to which we are required to deploy E‑911 services will 

 
  17

 
affect our capital spending obligations. Federal law limits our liability for uncompleted 911 calls to a degree commensurate with wireline carriers in our markets.
 In 2013, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless carriers and certain other text messaging service providers to send an automatic ‘bounce‑back’ text message to consumers who try to text 911 where text‑to‑911 is not available, indicating the unavailability of such services. In August 2014, the FCC required all wireless carriers as well as other providers of interconnected text messaging applications, to be capable of supporting text‑to‑911 service by December 31, 2014, and to provide such service to requesting PSAPs by June 30, 2015 or six months after a request from a PSAP, whichever is later. The FCC has also sought further comment regarding additional regulations pertaining to the provision of text‑to‑911 service. 
 In addition to CMRS licenses, our wireless business relies on FCC licensed spectrum for “Common Carrier Fixed Point to Point Microwave” referred to as Common Carrier Microwave. We currently operate over 200 licensed microwave links. Common Carrier microwave stations are generally used in a point-to-point configuration for cellular site connections or to connect points on the telephone network which cannot be connected using standard wireline or fiber optic cable because of cost or terrain. The majority of our license grants are for a period of 10 years.
 In 2008 the FCC issued Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) which established a Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) allowing CMRS providers to transmit emergency alerts to the public. In February 2013, the FCC introduced obligation to indicate whether carriers have opted in or out of providing this service to its subscribers. We have chosen to opt into the service and we are currently providing it to all of our retail wireless customers.
 The FCC’s rules require CMRS providers to offer “roaming” services to other providers.  Roaming enables one provider’s customers to obtain service from another provider when the customer is using their wireless device in an area served by the second provider.  These rules apply to voice, messaging, and data services, including Internet access, although the roaming rules vary somewhat among these services.  We are obligated to offer roaming, and we have the right to seek roaming from other providers, on reasonable terms and conditions.  The FCC has identified a variety of factors that are relevant to whether an offer to provide roaming is reasonable, including the price, terms and conditions, and whether the two providers’ networks are technologically compatible.  Changes in the FCC’s roaming regulation may affect the terms under which we provide roaming services to third parties and may affect our ability to secure roaming arrangements with other CMRS providers on behalf of our retail wireless customers.  
 We are obligated to pay certain annual regulatory fees and assessments to support FCC wireless industry regulation, as well as fees supporting federal universal service programs, number portability, regional database costs, centralized telephone numbering administration, telecommunications relay service for the hearing‑impaired and application filing fees. These fees are subject to change periodically by the FCC and the manner in which carriers may recoup these fees from customers is subject to various restrictions.
 Wireline Services
 Local Competition. The Communications Act encourages competition in local telecommunications markets by removing barriers to market entry and imposing on non‑rural incumbent local exchange carriers (or “ILECs”) various requirements related to, among other things, interconnection, access to unbundled network elements, collocation, access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights‑of‑way, wholesale and resale obligations, and telephone number portability.  These requirements continue to evolve through their implementation by the FCC and through FCC decisions forbearing from applying these rules to certain services and facilities.  Most recently, in July 2016, the FCC issued an order largely deregulating the provision of switched access services by ILECs.  Further future action by the FCC in connection with these requirements may have an effect on the financial condition or operations of our U.S. Wireline segment.  Our operations on the U.S. mainland have benefited from the reduced costs in acquiring required communication services, such as ILEC interconnection, as a result of these requirements. Provisions relating to interconnection, telephone number portability, equal access, and resale could, however, subject us to increased competition and additional economic and regulatory burdens. Our ILEC operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands through Innovative are exempt from most of these requirements pursuant to a rural exemption.

 While the FCC to date has declined to classify interconnected VoIP service as a telecommunications service or information service, it has imposed a number of consumer protection and public safety obligations on interconnected VoIP providers, relying in large part on its general ancillary jurisdiction powers. To the extent that we provide interconnected VoIP service we will be subject to a number of these obligations.
 Video Services. Video services systems are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act.  The FCC regulates our programming selection through local broadcast TV station mandatory carriage obligations, constraints on our retransmission consent negotiations with local broadcast TV stations, and limited regulation of our carriage negotiations with cable programming networks.  The FCC also imposes rules governing, among other things, leased cable set-top boxes, our ability to collect and disclose subscribers’ personally identifiable information, access to inside wiring in multiple dwelling units, cable pole attachments, customer service and technical standards, and disability access requirement. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties.   
     Wireless and Wireline Services
 Universal Service. In general, all telecommunications providers are obligated to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund (or “USF”), which is used to promote the availability of wireline and wireless telephone service to individuals and families qualifying for federal assistance, households located in rural and high‑cost areas, and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers. Contributions to the federal USF are based on end user interstate and international telecommunications revenue. Some states have similar programs that also require contribution. The FCC has suggested that it may examine the way in which it collects carrier contributions to the USF, including a proposal to base collections on the number of telephone numbers or network connections in use by each carrier. We contribute to the USF as required by the rules throughout the U.S., and receive funds from the USF for providing service in rural areas of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The collection of USF fees and distribution of USF support is under continual review by state and federal legislative and regulatory bodies, and changes to these programs could affect our revenues. We are subject to audit by the Universal Service Administration Corporation (or “USAC”) with respect to our contributions and our receipts of universal service funding. We believe we are substantially compliant with all FCC and state regulations related to the receipt and collection of universal service support.
 In November 2011, the FCC released an order reforming the USF program to phase out the current level of high‑cost USF support for wireless carriers over a period of five years, beginning in 2012. The scheduled phase out, however, was suspended in 2013 as the FCC addresses a delay in implementing phase two of its Mobility Fund program. We cannot predict the impact of any such changes on the amounts we pay or receive in USF funds and consequently, our efforts to build and maintain networks in certain rural markets. As part of the USF reforms, the FCC created two new replacement funds, the Connect America Fund and the Mobility Fund, both of which allow for the use of USF funds for broadband services, in addition to voice services. The new funds are intended to provide targeted financial support to areas that are unserved or under‑served by voice and broadband service providers and will be initiated during the phase out of USF support.
 In July 2012, the FCC initiated the application process for the Mobility Fund I program, a reverse auction for a one‑time distribution of up to $300 million intended to stimulate third‑ and fourth‑generation wireless coverage in unserved and under‑served geographic areas. A number of our subsidiaries participated in the Mobility Fund I reverse auction on September 27, 2012 and bid successfully for approximately $21.7 million in one‑time support to expand voice and broadband networks in certain geographic areas in order to offer either 3G or 4G coverage. These subsidiaries have completed the construction of the facilities funded by this support and are finalizing the submissions necessary to document this in order to receive their final payments.  
 Our newly acquired business in the U.S. Virgin Islands also benefits from USF support and expects to continue to receive its current annual support of approximately $16 million for the foreseeable future, subject to performance requirements to be outlined by the FCC. To continue to receive these funds, we must commit to comply with certain additional FCC construction and other requirements. We are participating in ongoing FCC proceedings that will establish the obligations that will be associated with these funds and the term over which they will continue to be disbursed but we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or its effects on our operations, if any.

 Intercarrier Compensation. Under federal and state law, telecommunications providers are generally required to compensate one another for originating and terminating traffic for other carriers. Consistent with these provisions, we currently receive compensation from other carriers and also pay compensation to other carriers.  In October 2011, the FCC, significantly revised its intercarrier compensation regime. Under the revised intercarrier compensation regime, where there is no pre‑existing agreement between a CMRS carrier and a local exchange carrier (or “LEC”) for the exchange of local traffic, such traffic between CMRS providers and the LEC is to be compensated pursuant to a default bill‑and‑keep regime, in which each carrier agrees to terminate calls from the other at no charge. The FCC’s revised intercarrier compensation regime also sets forth a transition schedule that will result in most traffic between telecommunications carriers being exchanged on a bill‑and‑keep basis. Specifically, the rules call for most terminating traffic exchanged with larger LECs to be exchanged on a bill-and-keep basis beginning July 1, 2017, and all terminating traffic with all LECs to be exchanged on a bill-and-keep basis by July 1, 2020. These rules may affect the manner in which we are charged or compensated for the exchange of traffic. We cannot predict the impact of any changes to these requirements on the amounts that we pay or receive.
 Net Neutrality.  The FCC, in March 2015, adopted net neutrality rules for broadband Internet providers, including mobile broadband Internet providers, under which such providers would not be able to engage in various forms of blocking, throttling or paid prioritization with respect to Internet content, subject to reasonable network management.  The FCC also adopted enhanced transparency rules and a general conduct rule regarding behavior of broadband Internet providers.  In doing so, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet service as a Title II telecommunications service under the Communications Act. The FCC, in reclassifying broadband Internet service as a Title II service, specifically forbore from applying many legacy common carrier regulations to broadband Internet service providers.  These network neutrality rules were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and challengers have asked the court to reconsider its decision. We cannot predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of any Court action.  Press reports and statements by the new FCC leadership indicate that the FCC is likely to relax or eliminate the net neutrality rules.    Telecommunications Privacy Regulations.  The FCC, in October 2016, adopted new privacy rules that impose certain transparency, consumer choice, data security, and data breach notification requirements on telecommunications providers, including broadband Internet providers. Among other things, the rules prohibit broadband providers from using or sharing their customers’ web browsing history or app usage information for advertising purposes without customers’ opt-in consent. They also require certain enhanced disclosure and consent requirements for offering consumers financial incentives, such as discounts, to permit the use and sharing of their data. Several parties have petitioned the FCC for reconsideration of the new rules, most of which are not yet effective. These requirements are scheduled to go into effect March 2, 2017, whereas the new notice and choice requirements will not be effective until at least December 2, 2017. The new Administration has publicly stated that it intends to modify or eliminate these rules, and we cannot predict the likely timing or outcome of any such action.
 CALEA.  Under certain circumstances, federal law also requires telecommunications carriers to provide law enforcement agencies with capacity and technical capabilities to support lawful wiretaps pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (or “CALEA”). Federal law also requires compliance with wiretap‑related record‑keeping and personnel‑related obligations. We are in compliance with all such requirements currently applicable to us. The FCC has adopted rules that apply CALEA obligations to high speed Internet access and voice‑over Internet protocol (or “VoIP”) services. Maintaining compliance with these law enforcement requirements may impose additional capital spending obligations on us to make necessary system upgrades.
 Obligations Due to Economic Stimulus Grants
 Three of our subsidiaries have received awards from the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (“BTOP”) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”). As a BTOP awardee, we are subject to the various terms and conditions included in the agency’s Notice of Funds Availability published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2009. Among these requirements are Interconnection and Non‑Discrimination requirements by which any awardee must comply with the following requirements: (i) adhere to the principles contained in the FCC’s Internet Policy Statement (FCC 05‑151, adopted August 5, 2005) or any subsequent ruling or statement; (ii) not favor any lawful Internet applications and content over 

 
  20

 
others; (iii) display network management policies in a prominent location on its web page and provide notice to customers of changes to these policies; (iv) connect to the public Internet directly or indirectly, so that the project is not an entirely private closed network; and (v) offer interconnection, where technically feasible without exceeding current or reasonably anticipated capacity limitations, at reasonable rates and terms to be negotiated with requesting parties. While FCC rules regarding these issues may apply to all our operations, these particular requirements apply only to our BTOP‑funded projects.
 As a BTOP awardee, we are also required to comply with other terms and conditions of the individual DOC grants, including reporting, transparency and audit requirements pursuant to Section 1512 of the ARRA, and notification and reporting obligations set forth in the Office of Management and Budget Memorandum, Implementing Guidance for Reports on Use of Funds Pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (OMB M‑09‑21, June 22, 2009). We believe we are currently in material compliance with all BTOP and DOC requirements applicable to our grants.
 U.S. State Regulation
 Federal law preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any CMRS provider. As a practical matter, we are free to establish rates and offer new products and service with a minimum of regulatory requirements. The states in which we operate maintain nominal oversight jurisdiction. For example, although states do not have the authority to regulate the entry or the rates charged by CMRS providers, states may regulate the “other terms and conditions” of a CMRS provider’s service. Most states still maintain some form of jurisdiction over complaints as to the nature or quality of services and as to billing issues. Since states may continue to regulate “other terms and conditions” of wireless service, and a number of state authorities have initiated actions or investigations of various wireless carrier practices, the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and could require us to change certain of our practices and ultimately increase state regulatory authority over the wireless industry. States and localities assess on wireless carriers taxes and fees that may equal or even exceed federal obligations.
 The location and construction of our wireless transmitter towers and antennas are subject to state and local environmental regulation, as well as state or local zoning, land use and other regulation. Before we can put a system into commercial operation, we must obtain all necessary zoning and building permit approvals for the cell site and tower locations. The time needed to obtain zoning approvals and requisite state permits varies from market to market and state to state. Likewise, variations exist in local zoning processes. If zoning approval or requisite state permits cannot be obtained, or if environmental rules make construction impossible or infeasible on a particular site, our network design might be adversely affected, network design costs could increase and the service provided to our customers might be reduced.
 In December 2016, the FCC initiated a proceeding to consider further streamlining the regulations governing the siting of wireless facilities on municipal rights-of-way. The FCC will consider in this proceeding whether to impose requirements on state and local jurisdictions to facilitate wireless tower siting.  Although we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding, and such streamlining of tower siting requirements may benefit our ability to expand our wireless network coverage. 
 U.S. Virgin Islands Regulation
 Virgin Islands Public Service Commission 
     Pursuant to the USVI Public Utilities Code, the Virgin Islands Public Service Commission (“PSC”) regulates certain telecommunications and cable TV services that Innovative provides in the U.S. Virgin Islands through Innovative. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a transfer of control agreement with the PSC on July 1, 2016, which imposes certain operational obligations on the Innovative companies. Among other things, the PSC establishes the rates and fees that we may charge local exchange residential and enterprise customers in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The PSC is required by US Virgin Islands law to review local utility rates every five years. In June 2016, the PSC adopted an order increasing the rates and fees that we may charge subject to certain conditions and future obligations. We believe that we have satisfied these requirements.  In addition, as a condition to Innovative’s receipt of 

 
  21

 
universal service funds from the FCC, the PSC is required to certify on annual basis that Innovative is in compliance with certain eligible telecommunication carrier (“ETC”) obligations. We believe that we comply with all such obligations but we cannot predict the outcome of future PSC proceedings relating to Innovative’s ETC status.  Further, our subsidiaries provide cable TV service in the U.S. Virgin Islands pursuant to two franchises granted by the PSC. Each franchise was renewed in July 2015 by an order issued by the PSC, but the PSC has not yet issued new franchise agreements memorializing these renewals. We understand that the renewal franchise agreements contain substantially similar terms and conditions as the prior franchise agreements, including a 15-year term.      
     Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park
     Our video and wireless companies in the U.S. Virgin Islands also receive tax benefits as qualifying participants in the USVI’s Research & Technology Park (“RTPark”) program. RTPark was chartered with the goal of promoting technology-based economic development in the territory and offering attractive economic incentives to companies that contribute to the development of the Virgin Islands through local employment and sourcing, as well as significant contributions to both the economy and the non-profit sectors of the community. As part of the program, our participating entities currently receive a 100% tax exemption applied against gross receipts and excise taxes as well as a 90% exemption against income taxes. These benefits equate to an annualized range of $2.0 to $2.5 million in expected tax exemptions for the year ended December 31, 2016. In order to qualify, we are required to maintain certain capital investments over the first five years of the agreement, pay monthly management fees of 0.4% of tenant company revenue, make annual charitable contributions to the University of the Virgin Islands, purchase products and services locally when feasible and provide in-kind services to RTPark. As part of our acquisition of our newly acquired business in the U.S. Virgin Islands, we expect to work with the RTPark in the 2017 fiscal year to consolidate our legacy wireless operations with our newly acquired operations as a single participant in the RTPark.     Guyana Regulation
 Our subsidiary, Guyana Telephone & Telegraph Limited (“GTT”), in which we hold an 80% interest, is subject to regulation in Guyana under the provisions of GTT’s License from the Government of Guyana, the Guyana Public Utilities Commission Act of 1999 as amended (or “PUC Law”) and the Guyana Telecommunications Act 1990 (or “Telecommunications Law”). The Public Utilities Commission of Guyana (or “PUC”) is an independent statutory body with the principal responsibility for regulating telecommunications rates and services in Guyana. The Ministry of Telecommunications, an agency of the Government of Guyana, has formal authority over telecommunications licensing and related issues.
 Licenses. GTT  provides domestic fixed (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services in Guyana pursuant to a License from the Government of Guyana granting GTT the exclusive right to provide the following: public telephone, radio telephone, and pay telephone services; domestic fixed services (both wireline and wireless); international voice and data services; sale of advertising in any telephone directories; and switched or non‑ switched private line service. The License, which was issued in December 1990, had an initial 20‑year term. Pursuant to the License, GTT also provides mobile wireless telephone service in Guyana on a non‑exclusive basis pursuant to an initial twenty‑year term. In November 2009, GTT notified the Government of its election to renew both the exclusive and non‑ exclusive license grants for an additional 20 year term expiring in 2030. In exercising this option, GTT reiterated to the Government that GTT and the Company would be willing to voluntarily relinquish the exclusivity aspect of GTT’s licenses, but only as part of an alternative agreement with the Government. On December 15, 2010, the Government, through the Office of the President, sent a letter to GTT indicating that GTT’s License was renewed until such time as a new legislative and regulatory regime to reform the telecommunications sector in Guyana is brought into force; however, GTT formally notified the Government that it is entitled to an unconditional renewal of both the exclusive and non‑exclusive license grants for an additional period of twenty years or until such time as GTT and the Company enter into an alternative agreement with the Government.
 PUC Law and Telecommunications Law. The PUC Law and the Telecommunications Law provide the general framework for the regulation of telecommunications services in Guyana. As a general matter, the PUC has authority to regulate GTT’s domestic and international telecommunications services and rates and to require GTT to supply certain 

 
  22

 
technical, administrative and financial information as it may request. The PUC claims broad authority to review and amend any of GTT’s programs for development and expansion of facilities or services, although GTT has challenged the PUC’s view on the scope of its authority. For a description of recent actions of the PUC, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.
 Regulatory Developments. In 2016, the Government of Guyana passed new telecommunications legislation introducing material changes to many features of Guyana’s existing telecommunications regulatory regime with the intention of introducing additional competition into Guyana’s telecommunications sector.  The legislation that passed, however, has not yet been implemented and does not include a provision that permits other telecommunications carriers to receive licenses automatically upon signing of the legislation, nor does it have the effect of terminating our exclusive license.  Instead, the legislation, as passed, requires the Minister of Telecommunications to conduct further proceedings and issue implementing orders to enact the various provisions of the legislation.  We have met with the Government of Guyana, including as recently as December 2016, to discuss modifications of our exclusivity rights and other rights under its existing agreement and license.  However, there can be no assurance that those discussions will be concluded before the Government issues new licenses as contemplated by the legislation or at all, or that they will satisfactorily address the Company’s contractual exclusivity rights. Although we believe that we would be entitled to damages or other compensation for any involuntary termination of its contractual exclusivity rights, we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in a proceeding to enforce our rights or that our actions would effectively halt any unilateral action by the Government.
 FCC Rule‑Making and International Long‑Distance Rates. The actions of foreign telecommunications regulators, especially the FCC in the United States, can affect the settlement or termination rate payable by foreign carriers to GTT for incoming international voice calls. While the FCC continues to monitor and evaluate termination rate levels and benchmarks, we cannot predict when and if the FCC will further reduce settlement rates or the effect lower rates will have on revenue in our International Integrated Telephony segment.
 Caribbean and Bermuda Regulation
 In Bermuda, we were historically subject to Bermuda’s Telecommunications Act of 1986 that authorized it to use spectrum to deliver services under its “Class B” license. In 2013, the Regulatory Authority implemented the Electronic Communications Act of 2011 (“ECA”), which allows communications service providers to enter new lines of business and introduces competition in the sector. As the government of Bermuda reforms the local telecommunications market, it has imposed regulatory and other fees and adopted additional regulation that have increased the regulatory costs incurred by and could otherwise impact our Bermuda operations. In 2017, the Regulatory Authority is expected to conduct a review of the market as required by the ECA. We cannot now accurately predict the impact to the competitive position of our Bermuda business or limitations that such actions will have on our ability to grow.
     In the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”),  the local government (rather than the government of the United Kingdom) has authority over telecommunications matters in the BVI, with the Ministry of Communications and Works acting as the licensing authority and the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (“TRC”) acting as the regulator. With the adoption of the Telecommunications Act, 2006, the BVI telecommunications market was substantially liberalized and reformed. In 2007, BVI Cable received a unitary license authorizing it to provide fixed, mobile, broadband, and video services. The unitary license has a 15-year term and is eligible for renewal for subsequent 15-year terms. 
     Renewable Energy Services Regulation
 U.S. Federal Regulation
 All of our currently owned projects in operation are solar “qualifying facilities” under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”). As such, the projects and the respective project company that own the projects are exempt from ratemaking and certain other regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act, as amended (“FPA”), and from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities.

 
  23

 

 Our projects are also subject to compliance with the applicable mandatory reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and approved by FERC under the FPA.
 Additionally, certain of the project companies that own projects or the “offtakers” of the electricity from the projects have entered into interconnection agreements with the local utility that allows the project companies or the offtakers to deliver excess electricity to the utility distribution system. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the local public utility commission or other state regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements.

India Regulation
 The Electricity Act, 2003
 The Electricity Act, 2003, or Electricity Act, regulates and governs the generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity in India. Under the Electricity Act, the transmission, distribution and trade of electricity are regulated activities that require licenses from the relevant electricity regulatory commission (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission), State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, or “SERCs”, or the joint commission (constituted by an agreement entered into by two or more state governments or the central government in relation to one or more state governments, as the case may be).
 In terms of the Electricity Act, any generating company may establish, operate and maintain generating stations without obtaining a license if it complies with prescribed technical standards relating to grid connectivity. The generating company is required to establish, operate and maintain generating stations, tie-lines, sub-stations and dedicated transmission lines.
 Further, the generating company may supply electricity to any licensee or even directly to consumers, subject to availing open access to the transmission and distribution systems and payment of transmission charges, including wheeling charges and open access charges, as may be determined by the relevant electricity regulatory commission. In terms of the Electricity Act, open access means the non-discriminatory provision for the use of transmission lines or distribution system or associated facilities with such lines or system, by any licensee or consumer or a person engaged in generation in accordance with the regulations specified by the relevant electricity regulatory commission.
 The relevant electricity regulatory commission is empowered to, among other things, determine or adopt the tariff for supply of electricity from the generating company to a distribution licensee (such as the distribution utility companies), for transmission of electricity, wheeling of electricity and retail sale of electricity. However, the relevant electricity regulatory commission may, in case of shortage of supply of electricity, fix the minimum and maximum tariffs for sale or purchase of electricity under agreements between a generating company and a licensee or between licensees, for a period not exceeding one year, to ensure reasonable prices of electricity. While determining the tariff, commissions are required to be guided by, among other things, the promotion of co-generation and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy.
 The Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2014 was introduced in the lower house of the Indian Parliament to amend certain provisions of the Electricity Act. Among other things, the amendment empowers the Indian government to establish and review a national renewable energy policy, tariff policy and electricity policy. Further, the Indian government may, in consultation with the state governments, notify policies and adopt measures for promotion of renewable energy generation including through tax rebates, generation linked incentives, creation of a national renewable energy fund, development of renewable industry and for effective implementation and enforcement of such measures.
     The generating company is also required to ensure compliance with certain other regulations, including the Central Electricity Authority (Safety Requirements for Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Electrical Plants and Electric Lines) Regulations, 2011.
 The National Electricity Policy, 2005
 The Indian government approved the National Electricity Policy on February 12, 2005, in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act. The National Electricity Policy, 2005 has material effects on our business since it 

 
  24

 
provides the policy framework to the central and state Electricity Regulatory Commission in developing the power sector, supplying electricity and protecting interests of consumers and other stakeholders, while keeping in view the availability of energy resources, technology available to exploit such resources, economics of generation using different resources and energy security issues. The National Electricity Policy emphasizes the need to promote generation of electricity based on non-conventional sources of energy.
 The National Electricity Policy provides that the SERCs should specify appropriate tariffs in order to promote renewable energy, until renewable energy power producers relying on non-conventional technologies can compete with conventional sources of energy. The SERCs are required to ensure progressive increase in the share of generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and provide suitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person. Further, the SERCs are required to specify, for the purchase of electricity from renewable energy sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution licensee. Furthermore, the National Electricity Policy provides that such purchase of electricity by distribution companies should be through a competitive bidding process. The National Electricity Policy permits the SERCs to determine appropriate differential prices for the purchase of electricity from renewable energy power producers, in order to promote renewable sources of energy.
 The National Tariff Policy, 2006
 The Indian government approved the National Tariff Policy on January 6, 2006, in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act. The National Tariff Policy, 2006 indirectly impacts our business because it provides the policy framework to the Electricity Regulation Commissions as described below. The National Tariff Policy requires all the SERCs to specify minimum percentages for electricity to be purchased from renewable energy sources. While deciding such percentage, the SERCs must take into account the availability of such resources in the region and its impact on retail tariffs. The National Tariff Policy further provides that procurement of electricity by distribution companies from renewable energy power producers must be done at preferential tariffs determined by the SERCs. Such procurement of electricity by distribution companies for future requirements is to be done, as far as possible, through a competitive bidding process in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Act among suppliers offering energy from same type of non-conventional sources. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for Tariff Determination from Renewable Energy Sources) Regulations, 2012
 The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has announced the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions for Tariff Determination from Renewable Energy Sources) Regulations, 2012, or Tariff Regulations, which prescribes the criteria that may be taken into consideration by the SERCs while determining the tariff for the sale of electricity generated from renewable energy sources which include, among other things, return on equity, interest on loan capital and depreciation. Accordingly, such tariff cannot be determined independently by renewable energy power producers such as our company. Pursuant to the National Tariff Policy, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission is required to determine the rate of return on equity which may be adopted by the SERCs to determine the generic tariff, keeping in view the overall risk and prevalent cost of capital, which factors are also to be taken into consideration by SERCs while determining the tariff rate. The Tariff Regulations prescribe that the normative return on equity shall be 20% per annum for the first 10 years and 24% per annum from the 11th year onwards.
     The Tariff Regulations also provide the mechanism for sharing of carbon credits from approved clean development mechanism projects between renewable energy power producers and the concerned beneficiaries. Under the Tariff Regulations, the project developer is entitled to retain 100% of the gross proceeds on account of clean development mechanism project benefits in the first year after the date of commercial operation of the generating station. Subsequently, in the second year, the share of the beneficiaries is increased to 10% and then progressively increased by 10% every year until it reaches 50% after which the clean development mechanism project proceeds are to be shared equally between the generating company and the beneficiaries.
 Renewable Purchase Obligations
 The Electricity Act promotes the development of renewable sources of energy by requiring the SERCs to ensure grid connectivity and the sale of electricity generated from renewable sources. In addition, it requires the SERCs 

 
  25

 
to specify, for the purchase of electricity from renewable sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity within the area of a distribution licensee, which are known as RPOs. Pursuant to this mandate, most of the SERCs have specified solar and non-solar RPOs in their respective states. In terms of the RPO regulations, RPOs are required to be met by obligated entities (that is, distribution licensees, captive power plants and open access consumers) by purchasing renewable energy, either by entering into PPAs with renewable energy power producers or by purchasing renewable energy certificates. The RPO regulations require the obligated entities to purchase power from renewable energy power producers such as our company. In the event of default by an obligated entity in any fiscal year, the SERCs may direct the obligated entity to deposit an amount determined by the relevant SERC, into a fund to be utilized for, among other things, the purchase of renewable energy certificates. Additionally, pursuant to the Electricity Act, a defaulting obligated entity may also be liable to pay a penalty as determined by the SERCs.
 In May 2015, the Supreme Court of India upheld a regulation that made it compulsory for captive power plants and open access consumers to purchase electricity to fulfill their RPOs. This landmark judgment is expected to boost the demand for renewable energy by captive players and also improve the marketability of renewable energy certificates in India.
 Safety and Environmental Laws
 We are governed by certain safety and environmental legislations, including the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008.
 Under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, failure to comply with the orders and restrictions passed by the State Pollution Control Boards may result in imprisonment of a minimum term of one and a half years. Additionally, certain acts including the destruction of property of the State Pollution Control Boards, failure to intimate the emission of pollutants or failure to furnish information to the State Pollution Control Boards may attract monetary penalties of up to Rs. 0.01 million and imprisonment of up to three months.
 The failure to comply with the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 may attract monetary penalties of Rs. 0.1 million and imprisonment of up to five years.
 Labor Laws
 We are required to comply with certain labor and industrial laws, which includes the Factories Act, 1948, the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948, the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, the Workmen Compensation Act, 1923, the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 and the Payment of Wages Act, 1936.
 Each of these legislations carry a penalty provision for non-compliance, which prescribe monetary penalties ranging from Rs. 0.001 million to Rs. 0.005 million and imprisonment for periods ranging from one month to three years.
