Uncertainties facing the Company
 
The Company has had only limited revenues as of the date of this Report.
 
As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund to keep operation, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, as of the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, several states in the United States are still experiencing high rates of infection and several countries around the world, including the United States and China, have taken steps to restrict travel. The existence of a worldwide pandemic, the fear associated with COVID-19, or any, pandemic, and the reactions of governments in response to COVID-19, or any, pandemic, to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the markets in which we operate. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Competition
 
Currently, our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have just recently started our operations. There are currently in the market larger and better-financed companies providing similar services.
 
The online sales industry is highly competitive. We compete with other numerous other firms, including larger regional, national and international firms that may have financial, operational, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Principal among these competitors is Amazon, Inc. Competitive factors include the level of technical expertise and experience, industry reputation, quality of work, price, geographic presence, dependability, availability of skilled personnel and financial stability. Our management believes that we can compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.
 
Employees
