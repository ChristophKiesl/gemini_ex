 Company Overview
Berkshire Grey is an Intelligent Enterprise Robotics (“IER”) company pioneering and delivering transformative AI-enabled robotic solutions that automate filling ecommerce orders for consumers or businesses, filling orders to resupply retail stores and grocery stores, and handling packages shipped to fill those orders. Our solutions transform supply chain operations and enable our customers to meet and exceed the demands of today’s connected consumers and businesses.
Our IER capabilities are grounded in patented and proprietary technologies for robotic picking (each picking or unit handling), robotic sortation (sortation of individual products, orders and parcels), robotic movement and mobility (movement and storage of orders and goods), and system orchestration which enables various intelligent subsystems to work together so that the right work is being done at the right time to meet our customer’s needs. We are a technology leader in robotics and AI automation with an intellectual property position buttressed by trade secrets and protected in part by 120 patents issued and 285 patents pending in technologies including robotic picking, mobility, gripping, sensing and perception, general robot control, and differentiated supporting mechanisms. Our proprietary technologies enable us to offer holistic solutions that automate supply chain operations. Our solutions include moving goods to robots that then pick and pack ecommerce or retail orders, robotically moving and organizing inventory and orders within a warehouse or logistics facility, and robotically sorting packages and shipments.
We deliver solutions. We are not a component technology company nor are we a conventional systems integrator. Instead, we create products from the technologies we pioneer and develop, and then incorporate the products (product modules) into solutions that meet customer performance metrics requirements such as throughput and accuracy rates. Once installed, our solutions meet or exceed performance specifications “out-of-the-box” and do not need to be pre-programed to perform its function. Our solutions address entire process functions within a warehouse or order fulfilment operation, which enables customers to focus on the core of their business and creates attractive returns for them. We also offer our customers post-installation support in the form of software updates as well as professional services including maintenance, system operation, and cloud-based monitoring and analytics. Because of our modular approach to solutions and the role of our software, we offer customers the ability to incrementally add to or modify solutions, and we can incorporate outside technologies with our product modules if desired. Further, since our solutions are modular, our systems can be implemented in both brownfield and greenfield sites while mitigating disruption to existing operations. We offer customers a range of purchase options including a robotics-as-a-service (“RaaS”) program that minimizes the up-front capital required when compared to conventional equipment purchase models. We also expect to realize recurring revenues from software maintenance and other services offered to our customers post-installation.
We created these technologies, product modules, and solutions to support our customers at a time that supply chain operations are under increasing competitive pressures driven by changes in consumer expectations related to the growth of ecommerce. According to LogistisIQ, global ecommerce sales have grown at a CAGR of 20% over the last decade, reaching approximately $3.5 trillion worldwide in 2019 and are expected to grow to approximately $7.5 trillion by 2026. Today’s consumers expect large numbers of items to choose from, fast fulfillment, “free” shipping, limited or zero substitutes, and rapid delivery of goods. These consumer expectations put significant pressures on conventional supply chain operations, and it is these pressures that Berkshire Grey technologies help customers address.
Just as consumer expectations have changed, so too must the underlying supply chain technologies. Retailers, eCommerce companies, and logistics companies are being asked for increased performance at the same time that competitive pressures and labor availability issues are pronounced. The top three industry challenges, per a recent MHI study, are labor availability, increasing consumer demands, and increasing competitive intensity. With our AI-enabled technologies, product modules, and solutions, customers can better meet increasing consumer demands and maximize the abilities of human workers, and can do so competitively.
We believe that the addressable opportunity for Berkshire Grey technology, product modules, and solutions is large. Based on labor consuming approximately 65% of warehousing spend (F. Curtis Barry & Company) and total annual global
   warehouse spend of $350 billion (McKinsey), global annual spending on warehouse labor is approximately $230 billion, which represents manual labor associated with processes that can be automated with our technology. Further, according to Mordor Intelligence, $56 billion is spent annually on automated material handling equipment globally, representing additional market opportunity for our technology. These two factors together yield an addressable market for our technology, product modules, and solutions of approximately $280 billion annually.
To date, most of our deployments have been with large, Fortune 50 companies, where our technology and solutions in production have achieved targeted metrics including throughput, accuracy, equipment effectiveness, and others. Our significant customers include Walmart, Target, FedEx, and TJX. Since inception, our customers have ordered approximately $200 million of systems from us, and as of December 31, 2021 we had orders of approximately $105 million in backlog that we expect to deliver and install during 2022 and early 2023. In 2021 Target Corporation, TJX, and FedEx, comprised approximately 32%, 27%, and 14% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2020 Target Corporation and SoftBank Robotics Corp., an affiliate of SB SVF II, a related party of Berkshire Grey, comprised approximately 70% and 30% of our revenue, respectively.
While we have more than a dozen product module offerings incorporating AI and other advanced technologies, we continue to develop new technologies and product modules. The strength of our team enables this continuous development — of our approximately 400 employees as of December 31, 2021, approximately 85% have technical degrees, approximately 55% have advanced degrees and over 30 employees have PhD’s. Our engineering team has well over 1,000 years of combined robotics experience.
Industry Background
According to Statistica, there are almost 19,000 warehouse facilities in the United States, and it is these facilities that represent a critical link in the commerce supply chain. The flow of goods throughout a warehouse or logistics facility typically starts with receiving products in bulk and ends with items exiting the facility by shipping items either in different bulk bundles or as single units depending on the use case. When items arrive at the warehouse they are generally unpacked, counted, and stored. When an ecommerce or store order arrives, goods are picked to meet that order, which is typically in batches of several orders at a time. The batches of picked goods are then sorted into their respective orders, packed into boxes, and shipped to stores or individual consumers. The process is generally similar for ecommerce and retail replenishment purposes and there are many similarities and parallels in package sortation facilities used by logistics companies. Today, most facilities utilize human labor to perform these functions, which creates challenges for businesses when labor is scarce or when labor requirements fluctuate during peak seasons. The figure below illustrates the prototypical flow of goods within a warehouse.
   
These are all processes that can be made more efficient with automation, in whole or in part, with our IER capabilities and specific solutions. Movement and mobility provide a common underlying substrate that enable goods to flow through the various processes while picking provides the ability to automate the item or smaller unit handling steps. Other providers’ systems or components that address only a portion of the value chain, e.g., a unique robotic gripper or even an individual mobile robot that, for example, only carries picked totes, by definition, support only that specific operation and have less potential to support the customer and have a smaller total addressable market.
Over the last several years, there has been a significant evolution of the retail industry, driven by changing demographics and a shift from shopping in conventional brick-and-mortar stores to online to omnichannel commerce fulfillment. Fundamental changes in consumer buying behavior have substantially increased the complexities of supply chains, order fulfillment processes and logistics. Consumers are demanding greater product choice and availability, shorter delivery times, free delivery, and simpler return processes. Just as consumer behaviors have changed, the underlying supply
   chain operations and supporting technologies must change too. Ecommerce is a driving factor in these changes — even impacting brick-and-mortar operations and their evolution such as ordering online for pick-up at store and related services.
Ecommerce is expected to continue to grow rapidly. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided added energy to that growth and transition. Such growth requires businesses to innovate their supply chains. Large companies such as Amazon have accelerated this phenomenon. Amazon has grown into the largest ecommerce business in the United States and according to Bank of America, Amazon captured more than 44% of the ecommerce market in the United States in 2019. Amazon’s investment in automation has enabled this growth. By investing in automation, Amazon has been able to offer its customers a large selection of items with fast fulfillment at competitive cost levels. Disruption due to Amazon pertains not just to the consumer behaviors and expectations but to the underlying supply chain operations as well. Other retailers, ecommerce companies, grocers, and logistics companies that participate in the same markets must compete. At Berkshire Grey we offer these companies our technology, product modules, and solutions to support these needs.
