ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Company Overview
Inuvo, Inc. is an internet advertising technology and digital publishing company incorporated in the state of Nevada. Our corporate office is located in Little Rock, Arkansas. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT under the symbol “INUV.”
We develop technology that delivers content and advertisements over the internet. We develop direct to consumer marketing technology to acquire consumers for our content. We develop analytics and optimization technologies to align advertisements with consumers. We generate revenue when an end user clicks on or views the advertisements we delivered. We manage our business as two segments, the Partner Network (advertising technology) and the Owned and Operated Network (digital publishing). In 2016 and 2015, the Partner Network represented 36% and 43% of total revenue and the Owned and Operated Network 64% and 57%, respectively. 
Within the Partner Network, we recruit online publishers and provide them an advertising delivery service, the primary brands for which are ValidClick and SearchLinks©. This service allows publishers the ability to place Inuvo ad-technology in various locations and configurations within their website or app for either a desktop or mobile implementation. We generate revenue in this segment when an advertisement that is delivered is subsequently clicked on by a consumer. Advertisements can be served by either Inuvo or a third party depending on the needs of the publisher. Typically, we collect revenue from advertisers when an advertisement is clicked and then share a portion of the revenue with the publisher. We deliver well in excess of a billion such advertisements annually. 
The Owned and Operated Network designs, builds and markets consumer websites and applications. This segment consists of our main online property marketed under the ALOT brand and a number of other websites targeted at specific demographics like EARNSPENDLIVE and sites designed specifically for generating leads in a specific market vertical like ASKTHIS for automotive. The majority of revenue generated by this segment is derived from advertisements that have been delivered on web pages that include both ALOT content and advertisements. Our ALOT branded websites and applications have a broad appeal focusing on popular topics such as health, finance, careers, local search, travel, living, education and auto.
We have a number of highly differentiated and proprietary strengths that include long standing advertising relationships with Yahoo and Google from whom we source advertising inventory which we distribute through our own online properties or through those of third party publishers;

• | the ability to serve hundreds of millions of advertisements to any device or browser in milliseconds;


• | the power to both self-market and self-monetize our own publishing business;


• | the capability to test advertising technology within our own publishing business;


• | the power to target advertisements based on website content, past behavior or to redirect users back to Inuvo content when the economics and alignment are optimized;


• | the capacity to expand to other geographies where appropriate;


• | the capability to develop and publish content just-in-time to meet demand from advertisers; and


• | a low cost operation in central Arkansas with access to numerous universities, and a proprietary technology infrastructure developed by, and in some cases patented by Inuvo.

We plan to continue growing our website and mobile application business by expanding the ALOT brand and acquiring new websites where appropriate. We plan to continue to distribute SearchLinks broadly throughout the Internet by growing our network of publishers. Financially, we are focused on growth while maintaining a positive cash flow. We expect to continue to make strategic investments principally in these areas: marketing technology associated with direct to consumer acquisition; the SearchLinks platform, and advertising targeting analytics.
Products and Services

• | SearchLinks: A proprietary platform to deliver ads to digital publisher webpages and apps using natural language technology to identify a site’s content, subject matter and context. It serves advertisements with text, images or video with a high relevancy to the identified content. The technology decides whether to serve the contextual advertisement or a behavioral advertisement based upon the greater monetization. The platform allows publishers to visualize the performance of advertising on their pages and manages the remuneration associated with that advertising.

• | ValidClick: A legacy software as a service and delivery platform that is being replaced by the SearchLinks platform. It offers a pay-per-click solution where advertisements are targeted to consumers based on content and behaviors.


• | MYAP: A proprietary online affiliate management solution that provides advertisers with the ability to sign up, manage and track the activities of publishers through a privately-branded platform with full data transparency. Typically, each MYAP customer is supported by a customized software implementation.


• | ALOT: Branded web properties with content developed, edited and published by ALOT in categories like health, finance, travel, entertainment, careers, education and automotive.

Key Relationships
We maintain long-standing relationships with Yahoo! and Google that provide access to hundreds of thousands of advertisers from which the revenue we generate originates. When an advertisement within either our Partner Network or Owned and Operated Network is clicked, we effectively sell that click to these partners who then sell it to the advertisers. We maintain multi-year service contracts with both companies. We have extended the Google agreement through February 2017 and the Yahoo! agreement, through May 31, 2018. In 2016, these two customers accounted for 98.3% of our total revenue. 
In addition to our key customer relationships, in the Partner Network we maintain important distribution relationships with owners and publishers of websites and mobile applications. Through our relationship with Yahoo! we provide these partners with advertisements through which they monetize their websites and mobile applications. We continuously monitor our partners' traffic with a variety of proprietary and patent protected software tools that can determine the quality of the traffic that is viewing and clicking on served advertisements.
Strategy
We believe we have a competitive advantage due to possessing three essential components of the end-to-end digital advertising ecosystem. Content: Virtually all the content we display on our sites is owned and developed by us. Our in-house team of writers and marketers develop material that attracts traffic to our internet properties. Marketing: The marketing of web properties and apps is a sophisticated, data-driven, statistical endeavor that requires expert analysts and statisticians as well as experienced marketing professionals. We believe our team and our marketing partners are among the best in the industry. Technology: We have state-of-the-art ad serving technology developed over the past ten years by our expert team of IT professionals. The technology assures instant ad serving of targeted ads which we believe yields high returns on investment, or ROIs, for publishers and more sales for advertisers. Owning these three assets gives us better control over our business and higher margins as we do not have the expense of outsourcing.
Our strategy has been to build an audience for our content so we can use our digital publishing business as a factory for sophisticated ad-technology development. By owning our own websites, we can adapt our ad-technology to any configuration while optimizing ad-targeting algorithms. Once we are satisfied that this ad-technology works well in our environment, we then commercialize it, selling it to other website publishers like us. This approach to ad-technology development reduces the time to market and improves the odds of success in-market.
Our ad-technology strategy has been to 1) develop technology that can target ads based on the content of a page; 2) develop technology that can target ads based on a past behavior, and 3) develop technology capable of redirecting ads to our branded digital content.
Sales and Marketing
We drive general awareness of our brands through various marketing channels including our websites, social media, blogs, public relations, trade shows, conferences and similar means. Marketing for our products differs by segment.
The Partner Network employs sales professionals that build and maintain relationships with advertisers and partners. Owners and publishers of websites and mobile applications are recruited into our network, serving as a delivery vehicle for the advertisements within this segment.
The Owned and Operated Network uses various marketing and optimization techniques to drive traffic and build awareness for the sites, engaging with various direct and indirect advertisers whose offers are placed on the sites and within the apps.

Competition
We face significant competition in our industry. Competitors are increasing their suite of offerings across marketing channels as a means to better compete for total advertising dollars.
A significant number of our competitors in both segments have greater name recognition and are better capitalized than we are. Our ability to remain competitive in our market segment depends upon our ability to be innovative and to efficiently provide unique solutions to our customers and vendors. There are no assurances we will be able to remain competitive in our markets in the future.
Partner Network
Success in the Partner Network is dependent on recruiting and retaining owners and publishers of websites and mobile applications who display our advertisements. We believe our proprietary software platform, the ability to quickly implement and provide new services, and the access to thousands of advertisements are significant advantages for us in building our partner base. Our competitors include companies with direct access to advertisers, such as Yahoo! and Google, Criteo SA, Media.net Advertising FZ-LLC, Taboola, Inc., Outbrain Inc. and a number of companies like ours with access to advertisers. Our partners face few barriers to switching advertising technology providers, so to compete effectively we must offer a better service than our competitors with a competitive rate of return for our partners.
Owned and Operated Network
Consumers have many choices in online content, and we believe that our success in the Owned and Operated Network is directly tied to our ability to provide easy access to valuable content and market it effectively. Our experience in search engine marketing, social media advertising and the creation of proprietary content helps us compete in this segment. We have many direct competitors, including Google, Yahoo!, WebMD LLC, Internet Brands, Inc., Leaf Group Ltd. and others, all of which offer online media or entertainment through websites, mobile apps or software products.
Technology Platforms
Our proprietary applications are constructed from established, readily available technologies. Some of the basic elements our products are built on components from leading software and hardware providers such as Oracle, Microsoft, Sun, Dell, EMC, and Cisco, while some components are constructed from leading Open Source software projects such as Apache Web Server, MySQL, Java, Perl, and Linux. By seeking to strike the proper balance between using commercially available software and Open Source software, our technology expenditures are directed toward maintaining our technology platforms while minimizing third-party technology supplier costs. 
We strive to build high-performance, availability and reliability into our product offerings. We safeguard against the potential for service interruptions at our third-party technology vendors by engineering controls into our critical components. We deliver our hosted solutions from facilities, geographically disbursed throughout the United States. Our applications are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by specialized monitoring systems that aggregate alarms to a human-staffed network operations center. If a problem occurs, appropriate engineers are notified and corrective action is taken. 
Intellectual Property Rights
We currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We have registered a number of trademarks including ValidClick®, ValidClick AdExchange®, MyAP®, Second Bite®, Kowa!Bunga®, Inuvo®, Zubican™, LocalXML™, Yellowise™, SearchLinks™ and trade and service registrations related to our products or services, including U.S. Federal Registration for ALOT® in the United States.
As of the date of this report we own two patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and have applied for a provisional patent to protect the technology that drives the SearchLinks process and algorithms:

• | "System and Method for Enabling Information Associations" which was issued on April 1, 2008, and the expiration date of which as determined based on patent term adjustment as calculated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") is September 11, 2021.


• | "Method for Preventing Real Time Click Fraud Detection, Prevention and Reporting for Online Advertising" which was issued on November 27, 2012, and the expiration date of which is January 22, 2030, as determined based on patent term adjustment as calculated by the USPTO.


• | The applied for SearchLinks provisional patent relates to pairing relevant advertisements with established web page content and more particularly to processing page content and retrieving relevant advertisements based on optimal comparisons and scoring criteria.

Although patents are only one component of the protection of intellectual property rights, if our patent applications are challenged, it may result in increased competition and the development of products substantially similar to our own. In addition, it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, and our competitors may independently develop technology similar to our own. We will continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. 
In addition to www.inuvo.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is also subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business. 
Employees
As of January 31, 2017, we had 61 full-time employees, none of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Seasonality
Our future results of operations may be subject to fluctuation as a result of seasonality. Historically, in the later part of the fourth quarter and the earlier part of the first quarter we experience lower Revenue Per Click (“RPC”) due to a decline in demand for inventory on websites and apps and the recalibrating of advertiser’s marketing budgets after the holiday selling season. If we are not able to appropriately adjust to seasonal or other factors, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
History
We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in October 1987 and operated within the oil and gas industry. This endeavor was not profitable, and from 1993 to 1997 we had essentially no operations. In 1997 we reorganized and through 2006 we acquired a number of companies involved in advertising and internet marketing. In 2009, following the weakness in the economy, a new team was called in to assess the array of businesses that had been acquired in the preceding years and as a result between 2009 and 2011, we sold or retired eleven businesses.
In March 2012, as part of a long-term strategy, we acquired Vertro, Inc. ("Vertro"), which owns and operates the ALOT product portfolio. This acquisition included the ALOT brand, as well as a long-standing relationship with Google. In 2013, with a grant funded by the State of Arkansas, we moved the headquarters to Arkansas where we have remained.
