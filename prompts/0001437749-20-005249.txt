Overview
 
We are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel products utilizing our proprietary PRINT® technology to transform the lives of patients. PRINT is a particle engineering platform that enables precise production of uniform drug particles designed to improve the safety, efficacy and performance of a wide range of therapies. We are currently focused on the development of two product candidates for which we hold worldwide commercial rights: LIQ861 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and LIQ865 for the treatment of local post-operative pain. LIQ861, for which we recently filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, with the FDA, is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed to improve the therapeutic profile of treprostinil by enhancing deep-lung delivery and achieving higher dose levels than current inhaled therapies. We have applied our PRINT technology to enable us to deliver LIQ861 through a convenient, palm-sized dry powder inhaler, or DPI. We have also applied our PRINT technology to our second product candidate, LIQ865, for which we have completed two Phase 1 clinical trials and have initiated Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies. LIQ865 is designed to deliver sustained-release particles of bupivacaine, a non-opioid anesthetic, to treat local post-operative pain for three to five days through a single administration. Additionally, we recently initiated a pre-clinical program to develop an inhaled product leveraging the benefits of our PRINT technology to engineer particles with precise, uniform, aerodynamic size and shape for deep lung delivery. 
LIQ861 for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
 
In January 2020, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for LIQ861, our lead product candidate, as a potential treatment for patients with PAH. Treprostinil is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin, a vasoactive mediator essential to normal lung function, which is deficient in patients with PAH. We believe that LIQ861 has the potential to improve the therapeutic profile of existing formulations of treprostinil by enhancing deep-lung delivery and achieving higher dose levels than current inhaled therapies. We are developing LIQ861 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway with Tyvaso® (treprostinil, inhaled solution) as the reference listed drug, which allows us to rely in part on the FDA’s previous findings of efficacy and safety of Tyvaso and the active ingredient treprostinil, which has been approved in four different products administered through the oral, inhaled and continuous infusion (parenteral) routes.
 
PAH is a chronic, progressive disease caused by the hardening and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries that can lead to right heart failure and eventually death. Treprostinil is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin, a vasoactive mediator essential to normal lung function that is deficient in patients with PAH. PAH is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of approximately 30,000 patients. An independent industry research firm estimated that in 2019 products containing treprostinil across its three routes of administration (oral, inhaled and parenteral infusion) may generate revenue that represents about one-quarter of the approximately $3.5 billion U.S. market for pulmonary hypertension drug therapies. The inhaled route of administration, in which medication is inhaled directly into the lungs, helps minimize the off-tissue adverse side effects of systemic delivery. Tyvaso, marketed by United Therapeutics in the United States, is the standard of care among the inhaled therapies, with more than 80% of inhaled prostacyclin sales in the United States. Current inhaled therapies, including Tyvaso, are delivered by a nebulizer, a device that converts a liquid formulation into mist, and require between four and nine doses per day. Nebulizers require regular care and maintenance, including daily cleaning and access to additional parts and supplies, such as distilled water and a power source, all of which compromise the portability of the device and the quality of life of patients.
 
We believe LIQ861, if approved, will be the first-to-market inhaled dry powder treprostinil that can be delivered using a convenient, palm-sized DPI. We further believe that LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current inhaled therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs. Based on our in vitro studies we believe that the precise size, trefoil-like shape and uniformity of each LIQ861 particle may provide deep-lung delivery of treprostinil and may reduce deposition in the upper airway where irritation and pain have been observed with nebulized treprostinil.

In August 2019, we completed an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial, INSPIRE, or Investigation of the Safety and Pharmacology of Dry Powder Inhalation of Treprostinil, for LIQ861. The primary objective of the INSPIRE study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861. The study was designed to evaluate patients who have either been under stable treatment with Tyvaso (nebulizer-delivered treprostinil), for at least three months and were transitioned to LIQ861 under the protocol, or Transition patients, or patients who had been under stable treatment with no more than two non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies for at least three months and then had their treatment regimen supplemented with LIQ861 under the protocol, or Add-On patients. Within the INSPIRE study, 18 Transition patients were evaluated in a one-directional crossover sub-study comparing bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of treprostinil following dosing of LIQ861 as compared with Tyvaso.
 
In March 2019, we reported that we had completed enrollment and met the primary endpoint, which was long-term safety and tolerability, in our INSPIRE trial. LIQ861 was observed to be well-tolerated in 109 patients, with 101 patients (93%) completing at least two months of treatment. During the two-month period, LIQ861 was evaluated at doses up to 159 mcg (clinical trial nomenclature of 150 mcg capsule strength) with no study-drug related serious adverse events. Dosing has exceeded 159 mcg in some patients receiving drug beyond the Month 2 time point. We have not yet determined a maximum tolerated dose of LIQ861. We also reported fully enrolling our one-directional crossover sub-study comparing bioavailability and PK of treprostinil as sub-study patients transitioned from Tyvaso to LIQ861.
 
In April 2019, we reported further data from these 109 patients in our INSPIRE trial on exploratory endpoints at two months of treatment that demonstrated generally favorable results with respect to six-minute walk distance and quality of life as indicated by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, or MLHFQ. In May 2019, we reported further presentation of this data at the American Thoracic Society, or ATS, International Conference 2019.
 
In June 2019, we reported results from the INSPIRE study indicating that the 79.5 mcg dose of LIQ861 (clinical trial nomenclature of 75 mcg capsule strength) correlates with nine breaths of Tyvaso, the maximum recommended label dose of Tyvaso. Analysis of the data from the PK sub-study in patients showed variability in systemic plasma levels of both LIQ861 and Tyvaso, which is believed to be attributed to variation in severity of disease and has been seen in prior studies of treprostinil in patients. To more accurately characterize the PK of LIQ861, we conducted two additional PK studies in healthy volunteers. In the first of these studies, we observed unexpected variability in PK levels. Post-hoc analysis showed that plasma levels of treprostinil were tightly correlated to the LIQ861 dose delivered. Based upon additional non-clinical and clinical work, we believe the unexpected variability seen in this healthy volunteer study was due to an administration technique unique to the conduct of the study in the Phase 1 setting. In August 2019, we completed a second PK study in healthy volunteers in which the proper administration technique was followed. This study demonstrated significantly reduced variability, and we believe we have established comparative bioavailability to the reference listed drug.
 
Final enrollment in the pivotal INSPIRE trial included 121 PAH patients to assess safety and tolerability through Month 2, the primary endpoint of the trial. Of the 121 patients enrolled in the study, 55 were Transition patients and 66 were Add-On patients. Add-On patients started on a dose of 26.5 mcg of LIQ861 (clinical trial nomenclature of 25 mcg capsule strength), with most (>80%) titrating to a 79.5 mcg dose or higher within the first two months of treatment. Consistent with preliminary data presented in the second quarter of 2019, LIQ861 was observed to be well-tolerated and treatment-emergent adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in nature at Month 2 up to doses of 159 mcg of LIQ861, the highest dose studied at Month 2. Durability of therapy with LIQ861 appeared to be favorable, with 96% of Transition patients and 91% of Add-On patients remaining on study drug at the Month 2 timepoint.
 
Initial analysis of the exploratory endpoints from the INSPIRE study indicates that LIQ861 may provide functional and quality-of-life benefits to PAH patients in New York Heart Association, or NYHA, functional classes II and III. More than 90% of all patients who completed two months of treatment maintained or improved their NYHA functional class. Additionally, we observed improvement in six-minute-walk-distance and quality of life as measured by the MLHFQ in both patient groups.
 
We continued to treat patients who chose to remain on LIQ861 beyond the Month 2 timepoint of the primary endpoint. More than 80% of INSPIRE patients remained on study drug at Month 4 with no significant changes in safety or tolerability observed compared to Month 2. At the completion of the INSPIRE study, the patient with the longest duration of treatment had been on LIQ861 therapy for 18 months. To provide for continuity of treatment, patients from INSPIRE were provided the opportunity to continue receiving treatment in an extension study, which is currently ongoing. In addition, we are enrolling patients in a clinical study at certain investigational sites in Europe to characterize the hemodynamic dose-response relationship to LIQ861. We are also considering conducting other clinical trials to generate additional data on LIQ861, including a clinical trial in pediatric patients. We also continue to conduct development work in support of potential approval and commercialization of LIQ861, including label and patient-use assessments.

LIQ865 for Post-Operative Pain
 
LIQ865 is our proprietary injectable, sustained-release formulation of bupivacaine, a non-opioid pain medication. We have engineered the size and composition of the LIQ865 PRINT particles to release bupivacaine over three to five days through a single administration for the management of local post-operative pain after a surgical procedure. We completed a Phase 1a clinical trial of LIQ865 in Denmark in 2017 and a Phase 1b clinical trial in the United States in 2018. We initiated Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies in 2019 to assess LIQ865 in multiple non-clinical tissue models. Results from a study to assess incision tensile strength after healing were acceptable and not statistically different from controls. A nonclinical study to examine soft tissue healing was also completed, and the results were acceptable and comparable to vehicle-treated, saline-treated, and Marcaine-treated sites. We believe this data supports progression to Phase 2 hernia repair studies. In a study to assess bone fracture healing, we observed dose-dependent delayed healing at the two LIQ865 doses studied; however, there were no adverse effects noted on surrounding soft tissues. Additional studies have been initiated with lower doses of LIQ865 to determine a no adverse effect level, or NOAEL, on bone healing. We will review the results from these toxicology studies, and if supportive, we intend to initiate Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trials, subject to availability of capital and other factors, during 2021. We believe LIQ865, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to provide significantly longer local post-operative pain relief compared to currently marketed formulations of bupivacaine.
 
We estimate that there were over 40 million surgeries in our target market, which consists of orthopedic and soft tissue surgeries, performed in the United States in 2016. According to IMS Health, an independent market research firm, the global market for local anesthetics was approximately $761.1 million in 2017. Despite current pain-management protocols, post-operative pain is still undermanaged, with studies showing that approximately 50% of patients self-report inadequate pain relief. Post-operative pain management is becoming more important as surgeries increase in volume and complexity and hospitals seek treatments that support faster recovery and time to discharge. Concurrently, the risk of opioid abuse and diversion has led physicians, payors and the U.S. federal government to prioritize pain management strategies that minimize reliance on opioids. Local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, provide a well-established, non-opioid option for post-operative pain management, but their duration of efficacy has been limited to eight hours or less. The FDA has approved one long-acting local anesthetic, liposomal bupivacaine, but pain relief typically lasts only 24 to 36 hours, according to physicians, and its use in combination with other local anesthetics can result in an unsafe release of drug.
 
Our PRINT Technology
 
Both LIQ861 and LIQ865 are based upon our proprietary PRINT particle engineering technology, which allows us to engineer and manufacture highly uniform drug particles with precise control over their size, three-dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition. By controlling these physical and chemical parameters of particles, PRINT enables us to target and design desirable pharmacological benefits into product candidates, including prolonged duration of drug release, increased drug loading, a more convenient method of administration, novel combination products, enhanced storage and stability and the potential to reduce adverse side effects. We have scaled PRINT manufacturing to meet the demands of clinical development and, we believe, commercial production. Our approach enables us to design and produce custom micro- and nano-particles containing existing or new small molecule drugs or biologics. For example, we have engineered LIQ861 so that each particle has an ideal, uniform, aerodynamic size and shape for deep-lung delivery. Our PRINT particle engineering technology also allows us to design the chemical composition of particles to control drug release ranging from minutes, days, weeks or months as needed to meet a target profile, such as LIQ865’s three to five day release of bupivacaine.

Development, Regulatory and Commercial Strategy
 
Initially, our internal pipeline is focused on the development of improved and differentiated drug products containing FDA-approved active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, with established efficacy and safety profiles, which we believe are eligible for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to seek marketing approval in the United States. The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway can be capital efficient and potentially enable a shorter time to approval. We are seeking marketing approval in the United States for LIQ861 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which would allow us to rely in part on existing knowledge of the safety and efficacy of the reference listed drugs. The FDA has indicated that it considers LIQ861, which is delivered by a DPI, to be a drug-device combination product and, accordingly, the DPI will be evaluated as part of our NDA filing. We also intend to develop LIQ865 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Additionally, we recently initiated a pre-clinical program to develop an inhaled product leveraging the benefits of our PRINT technology to engineer particles with precise, uniform, aerodynamic size and shape for deep lung delivery.
 
In addition to building our own internal pipeline, we may collaborate with pharmaceutical companies to assist in the development of their product candidates by leveraging our PRINT technology, which we believe has application across a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States either by ourselves or through partnership or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. Outside of the United States, we intend to pursue the regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies with regional expertise. We intend to manufacture our product candidates using in-house capabilities. Where appropriate, we will rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce, package and distribute our approved drug products on a commercial scale.
 
Product Pipeline
 
The following table summarizes our clinical-stage product candidates being developed using PRINT technology.
 


Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to develop and commercialize medicines with improved and differentiated product profiles based on our PRINT particle engineering technology. To achieve this goal, we intend to execute the following key elements of our business strategy:

● | Obtain regulatory approval of LIQ861, our proprietary dry powder inhalation formulation of treprostinil. In January 2020, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for LIQ861, our lead product candidate, as a potential treatment for patients with PAH. Treprostinil is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin, a vasoactive mediator essential to normal lung function, which is deficient in patients with PAH. We believe that LIQ861 has the potential to improve the therapeutic profile of existing formulations of treprostinil by enhancing deep-lung delivery and achieving higher dose levels than current inhaled therapies. LIQ861 is being developed under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway with Tyvaso as the reference listed drug, which allows us to rely in part on the FDA’s previous findings of efficacy and safety of Tyvaso and the active ingredient treprostinil, which has been approved in four different products administered through the continuous infusion (parenteral), inhaled and oral routes. Our NDA submission was supported by the favorable results of our pivotal Phase 3 trial, INSPIRE, conducted in 121 patients and completed during the third quarter of 2019.

● | Advance our local post-operative pain product candidate, LIQ865, through Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies into Phase 2 clinical trials. We completed a Phase 1a clinical trial of LIQ865 in Denmark in 2017 and a Phase 1b clinical trial in the United States in 2018. We initiated Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies in 2019 to assess LIQ865 in multiple non-clinical tissue models.

We will review the results from these toxicology studies, and if supportive, we intend to initiate Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trials, subject to availability of capital and other factors, during 2021. We believe LIQ865, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to provide significantly longer local post-operative pain relief compared to currently marketed formulations of bupivacaine.

● | Secure regulatory approval and commercialize our products in the United States either ourselves or through partnership or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies, and globally through licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to LIQ861 and LIQ865. We are currently exploring opportunities to commercialize LIQ861 in the United States, subject to receiving regulatory approval, either by ourselves or through partnership or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. With respect to LIQ865, after reviewing the results of all of our Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies, and subject to the availability of sufficient funding, we plan to evaluate whether to pursue continued internal development or to explore licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. Outside of the United States, we intend to pursue the regulatory approval and commercialization of LIQ861 and LIQ865 through licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies with regional expertise.

● | Expand our internal pipeline leveraging our PRINT technology. We intend to continue targeting diseases where we believe our PRINT technology can improve the efficacy, safety and patient experience of current treatments that have been impaired by suboptimal drug product formulation and delivery. We plan to focus initially on the development of improved and differentiated drug products containing FDA-approved active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, with proven efficacy and safety profiles eligible to use the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. In addition, we may expand our clinical development of LIQ861 and LIQ865, where appropriate, into broader indications or new applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue strategic collaborations to maximize the value of products enabled by PRINT technology. In addition to advancing our own internal product candidates, we have collaborated, and may consider collaborating, with pharmaceutical companies to develop their own product candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration, leveraging our PRINT technology. We believe that collaborating with pharmaceutical companies helps advance new PRINT capabilities, while adding to our intellectual property portfolio.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we have several key strengths that have contributed to the development of our business and that will help us to realize our goal of becoming a biopharmaceutical company across research, development and commercialization activities. Our competitive strengths include:

● | Our PRINT technology gives us the capability to overcome the constraints of conventional formulation and production methods and can be applied broadly across therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration. Our PRINT technology allows us to precisely engineer drug particles in a wide variety of compositions, sizes and shapes and achieve a high level of control over the physical and chemical characteristics of drug particles, as compared to conventional formulation and production methods. PRINT particles can be designed to address specific pharmacological or therapeutic objectives, such as enhancing the route of administration, improving solubility, enhancing stability or extending therapeutic effects. Using our PRINT technology, we are able to engineer, among others, small molecule and biologic particles, single agent drug and combination drug particles and vaccine particles to improve efficacy, safety and convenience for patients. Our internal pipeline strategy is currently focused on developing proprietary innovations to currently approved drug products in order to minimize development risks and increase speed to market. In particular, we have designed LIQ861 to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs using a convenient, palm-sized DPI. We believe that this may lead to a more attractive product profile with a more convenient method of administering the drug, as compared to the currently available inhaled therapies. We have also designed LIQ865 with the intention of providing patients with local post-operative analgesia for three to five days. We believe this would provide a longer period of pain relief than the currently available local-acting pain drugs and thereby reduce reliance on opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, for local post-operative pain management.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have scaled operations with rapid and cost-effective transition to clinical development and commercial production. We believe our research and development operations and PRINT technology allow us to transition rapidly and cost-effectively from laboratory to clinical development and ultimately commercial-scale manufacture of drug particles. Utilizing well-established techniques from other roll-to-roll manufacturing processes, we have scaled PRINT technology to support the quality and quantity needs for clinical and, we believe, commercial production of our product candidates. The manufacturing equipment for the PRINT technology requires a relatively small footprint, low capital investment and minimal operating costs. We believe our manufacturing facilities comply with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have a strong proprietary position through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how and licensing arrangements. We protect our PRINT technology and the resulting engineered particles through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how and licensing arrangements. We have an active patent strategy that covers major geographic markets, including the United States, Europe and Japan. As of December 31, 2019, our patent portfolio, which includes patents and patent applications we own or co-own, as well as patents and patent applications we have licensed from third parties, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or UNC, comprises 127 issued patents and 32 pending patent applications worldwide. As we develop new product candidates, either independently or with collaborators, we will seek additional patent protection.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Product Candidates
 
LIQ861
 
Our lead product candidate, LIQ861, is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed using our PRINT technology to enhance deep-lung delivery using a convenient DPI for the treatment of PAH. We believe LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current inhaled therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs. If approved, we believe LIQ861 will have the potential to increase the number of patients using the inhaled route of administration for PAH by providing the benefits of inhaled prostacyclin therapy earlier in a patient’s disease progression as well as delaying the burden of starting continuously infused agents.
 
Background on PAH
 
PAH is a chronic, progressive disease caused by hardening and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries that can lead to right heart failure and eventually death. Prostacyclin is a vasoactive mediator essential to normal lung function that is deficient in patients with PAH. With PAH, the elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries strains the right side of the heart as it pumps blood to the lungs. The extra stress causes the heart to enlarge and become less flexible, compromising its ability to pump blood through the lungs and to the rest of the body. PAH initially presents as exertional dyspnea, lethargy and fatigue and may be confused with other disease states with similar symptoms. PAH often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed until symptoms become severe, with the mean time from onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis being more than two years in the United States. As PAH progresses and right ventricular failure develops, exertional chest pain, or angina, exertional syncope and peripheral edema may develop. Following confirmation of the diagnosis based on hemodynamic parameters, treatment is recommended to lower pulmonary arterial pressures and treat the symptoms of PAH.
 
PAH is part of a larger classification of pulmonary hypertension, or PH, which is divided into five groups based on the criteria of the World Health Organization, or WHO, as defined at the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension. WHO Group I is comprised of individuals with PAH.
 
PAH is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of approximately 30,000 patients. The mean age of diagnosis is 50 years according to both French and U.S. registries, with more women being diagnosed with PAH than men. Patients may have idiopathic PAH, in which no underlying cause can be determined, or a heritable form of the disease. A large number of PAH patients also have associated comorbidities such as congenital heart disease, HIV, connective tissue diseases like scleroderma, liver diseases, systemic hypertension, obesity, clinical depression, non-PAH related obstructive airways, sleep apnea and diabetes.
 
Due to delayed diagnosis, many patients already have an advanced form of PAH, requiring aggressive treatment combining multiple classes of therapy. The severity of PAH may be classified according to the heart failure guidelines of the NYHA based on the degree of limitation of physical activity and described by the American Heart Association as follows:
 

● | NYHA Class I — No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea, which is shortness of breath.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NYHA Class II — Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NYHA Class III — Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation or dyspnea.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   9

  


● | NYHA Class IV — Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As the disease progresses, these symptoms cause a significant negative impact on quality of life, limiting the ability to perform common daily activities, including work, travel and previous hobbies. Patients also describe the emotional toll of PAH, including fear, frustration, embarrassment and stigma. The burden of care associated with currently available treatments can add further logistical and emotional burden to the patients.
 
Current Therapies and Their Limitations
 
There is currently no cure for PAH. The goals of existing treatments are to alleviate symptoms, maintain or improve NYHA functional class, delay disease progression and improve quality of life. Inhaled therapies are generally prescribed for, but not limited to, patients in NYHA Class II and Class III. Approved drugs target three distinct molecular pathways that have been implicated in the disease process: the prostacyclin pathway, the nitric oxide pathway and the endothelin pathway. Drugs targeting each of these pathways are used alone or in combination with each other to treat patients with PAH. Prostacyclin deficiency in the lung is a central dysfunction in PAH, but can be supplemented with prostacyclin analogs. Prostacyclin deficiency can also be managed with a recently approved selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonist, selexipag. Nitric oxide deficiency can be treated with phosphodiesterase-5, or PDE5, inhibitors, which target a specific enzyme, increasing vasodilation. Endothelin overexpression in PAH patients causes vasoconstriction of pulmonary vasculature, but can be treated with endothelin receptor antagonists, or ERAs. Many physicians start their PAH patients on oral PDE5 inhibitors, oral ERAs or both. Drugs targeted to the prostacyclin pathway are usually added to these oral therapies, but can be used alone.
 
Drugs targeting the prostacyclin pathway are central to PAH therapy. Prostacyclin is essential to normal lung function. In healthy people, prostacyclin, which is a vasoactive mediator, is continually released by the lungs into the pulmonary arterial circulation, where it affects the regulation of vascular tone, including through direct vasodilation of pulmonary arteries, inhibition of the proliferation of smooth muscle cells within arteries and inhibition of platelet aggregation. To supplement the deficiency of prostacyclin in patients with PAH, several prostacyclin analogs have been developed including epoprostenol, which is administered intravenously; treprostinil, which can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or in nebulized or oral formulations; and iloprost, which can be administered intravenously or in nebulized form. A new class of drugs called selective IP prostacyclin receptor agonists help stimulate some of the mechanisms that would otherwise be promoted by prostacyclin or an analog. Selexipag, an oral agent, is the only approved drug in this new class.
 
The goal of treatment targeting the prostacyclin pathway is to maximize a patient’s exposure to the highest tolerable level of drug. Prostacyclin analogs, like treprostinil, have been developed for continuous infusion, either intravenously or subcutaneously, inhalation using a nebulizer and oral administration in the form of tablets. The maximal efficacy benefit of any one drug in the prostacyclin pathway is partially limited by its specific safety profile. Drugs exerting their effect through the prostacyclin pathway, including oral treprostinil and IP prostacyclin receptor agonists such as selexipag, are limited by side effects from binding of the drug to receptors in non-targeted tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract and nerves, which can cause diarrhea, nausea and jaw pain. Nebulized solutions can have side effects including cough, upper airway irritation and pain caused by their topical irritant properties, which limits the amount of drug that can be given to the patient. As the disease progresses, patients require continuous prostacyclin infusion to maximize drug exposure. However, infusion pumps can cause side effects related to infusion site pain and risk of infection, while also adversely affecting quality of life.
 
Delivering prostacyclin analogs locally to the lungs by inhalation has been effective and causes fewer systemic side effects. Inhalation of prostacyclin analogs supplements the endogenous production of prostacyclin where it is normally synthesized, near the targeted pulmonary arteries. As a result, inhalation of prostacyclin analogs helps avoid side effects related to off-target tissues and takes advantage of binding key prostacyclin receptors that are preferentially expressed in the lung. The only inhaled prostacyclin analogs approved by the FDA are Tyvaso and Ventavis, which both require nebulizers.

Tyvaso (treprostinil) is approved in the United States and Israel, but is not approved in Europe and Japan. Tyvaso is indicated for the treatment of PAH to improve exercise ability. The maximum recommended dose of Tyvaso is 54 mcg, delivered four times daily from a proprietary nebulizer, requiring nine breaths for each dose. In a long-term open-label extension study of Tyvaso, patients continued treatment for a mean duration of 2.3 years, with 89% of patients achieving the target dose of 54 mcg, delivered in nine breaths, and 42% achieving a dose of 72 mcg, delivered in 12 breaths. It has been reported that more than 80% of PAH patients on inhaled therapy in the United States use Tyvaso. United Therapeutics reported approximately $415 million in sales of Tyvaso in 2019.
 
Ventavis (iloprost) is approved in the United States, Europe and Japan. Ventavis is a synthetic analog of prostacyclin indicated for the treatment of PAH to improve a composite endpoint consisting of exercise tolerance, symptoms and lack of deterioration. Ventavis is administered with a proprietary nebulizer six to nine times per day during waking hours, no more than once every two hours, and takes six to ten minutes to administer per use.
 
Tyvaso and Ventavis both require the use of proprietary nebulizers. Patients must follow specific instructions to set up and operate the device, clean the device daily, locate a power source or use a battery to operate the device, and carry the device and its associated accessories around in a large carrying case, along with distilled water, to administer the treatment throughout the day. As a result, the use of these approved inhaled prostacyclin therapies is typically limited to patients who have not responded to oral medications that target the three pathways. Current medical practice is to add an inhaled drug to the patient’s existing oral ERA and/or PDE5 treatment regimen, rather than withdrawing the oral drug upon initiation of the inhaled drug.
 
Potential Benefits of Our Approach
 
We believe LIQ861 can overcome the limitations of current nebulized therapies and has the potential to maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs using a convenient, palm-sized DPI. In our clinical trials, LIQ861 has been well-tolerated at doses approximately twice as high as the maximum recommended dosage of Tyvaso. These higher doses of inhaled dry powder treprostinil can also be administered in one to four breaths, compared to nine breaths for the maximum recommended dose of Tyvaso. Additionally, we believe LIQ861 may have the potential to improve overall patient adherence by offering the convenience of a discrete, palm-sized DPI. In our market research, patients expressed a preference for a DPI product, noting that it can fit easily into a purse, minimize hassle while traveling and reduce the breaths and time associated with their current nebulized treatments.
 
The advantages of the LIQ861 product profile are enabled by our PRINT technology. Each LIQ861 particle is designed to enhance delivery and deep-lung penetration. LIQ861 particles are a precise size and highly uniform shape, since particles are formed from mold cavities that exactly match each other. Competing technologies, such as spray-drying, create particles that have a broader variation in size and shape. As a result, particles farther from the mean target size would be too large or too small to reach the intended location in the deep-lung.
 
Inspired by a naturally occurring pollen, LIQ861 PRINT particles have a one micrometer trefoil-shape measured by an inscribed one micrometer circle as shown in the figure below. In vitro studies suggest that the uniformity of size and shape allow our inhaled particles to target delivery into the lungs with less deposition in the upper airways. Our independent control of the parameters of drug particles has enabled us to create the first clinically tested therapeutic that stabilizes treprostinil in an inhaled dry powder formulation.

LIQ861 is administered using the RS00 Model 8 DPI, which is manufactured by Plastiape S.p.A. This device and its variants have been used in at least eight marketed products globally since 2001, including Novartis’s Foradil Aerolizer® for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.
 
The picture below shows the DPI used to administer LIQ861:
 

Clinical Development
 
The INSPIRE study was designed to evaluate patients who have either been under stable treatment with nebulizer-delivered treprostinil for at least three months and are transitioned to LIQ861 under the protocol or who have been under stable treatment with no more than two non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies for at least three months and have their treatment regimen supplemented with LIQ861 under the protocol. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861.
 
In the United States, we submitted  an NDA under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in January 2020. The 505(b)(2) pathway allows us to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior conclusions of efficacy and safety for Tyvaso, and the active ingredient treprostinil (which has been the active ingredient in several different products, in total, approved by the FDA, with routes of administration including continuous infusion, inhaled and oral routes).

Clinical Development
 
We have developed LIQ861 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which allows for an accelerated development program based upon establishing safety, tolerability, and comparative bioavailability to a reference listed drug, which for LIQ861 is Tyvaso. Our clinical development program has consisted of two principal studies. The first of these was a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers that was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of LIQ861 in healthy volunteers. After an end of Phase 1 meeting with the FDA, we proceeded directly to a pivotal Phase 3 study, without being required to conduct a Phase 2 study. In addition, we conducted two supplementary pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers. The results of these studies, which serve as the basis for our NDA submission, are described below.
Phase 1 Trial
 
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 1 trial in 57 healthy volunteers to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics following a single administration of LIQ861 at treprostinil capsule strengths between 25 mcg and 150 mcg. The subjects were enrolled into six dose cohorts. Within each dose cohort, subjects were randomized to receive LIQ861 or a placebo.
Dose Selection
 
For the first-in-human study, the initial dose for LIQ861 was chosen based on the indicated dosing for the reference listed drug, Tyvaso. Independent investigations of particle emission using the RS00 Model 8 DPI and simulated inspiration of the bulk powder from a nebulizer led to a projection that a 25 mcg treprostinil capsule strength of LIQ861 dry powder inhalation would result in approximately similar treprostinil administration as three breaths of Tyvaso, or 18 mcg of treprostinil, the lowest approved dose through nebulization. The following table shows the doses of LIQ861 tested along with our estimate of the equivalent Tyvaso dose.

(1) | LIQ861 capsule treprostinil strength doses between 25 mcg and 100 mcg are single capsules. LIQ861 capsule treprostinil strength doses of 125 mcg and 150 mcg are two capsules, but, if approved, they could be developed as single capsules and therefore only require one to two breaths.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Tyvaso (treprostinil) full prescribing information: initial dosage: 3 breaths (18 mcg); maximum recommended dosage: 9 breaths (54 mcg).
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our conclusion from this study is that the capsule strength of 75 mcg of LIQ861 is approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended dose of 54 mcg, or nine breaths, of Tyvaso, and the capsule strength of 150 mcg of LIQ861 is approximately double the maximum recommended dose of Tyvaso.
 
Safety and Tolerability
 
In the Phase 1 clinical trial, we escalated the treprostinil capsule strength of LIQ861 progressively from 25 mcg to 150 mcg. There were no dose-limiting toxicities at the highest dose evaluated. We noted no serious adverse events and all reported treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, related to the treatment were mild. The most frequent adverse event reported by subjects receiving LIQ861 was mild cough and throat irritation.
 
   13

  

We did not observe a proportional increase of adverse events as the treprostinil capsule strengths were escalated from 25 mcg to 100 mcg. No adverse events were observed in subjects who received the placebo PRINT particles that contained only excipients.
 
Pharmacokinetics
 
In the Phase 1 trial, the LIQ861 plasma levels increased proportionally as the dosage of LIQ861 increased, as shown in the graph below. At higher doses, 50% of subjects receiving LIQ861 had measurable treprostinil levels after four hours, which could indicate the potential to minimize symptoms between dosing cycles.
 

The pharmacokinetic parameters in the table below were estimated from plasma samples. Nominal elapsed time from dosing was used to estimate all individual pharmacokinetic parameters, including:
 

● | Cmax Maximum observed plasma concentration; 
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Tmax Time of maximum concentration; 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | T1/2 Terminal-phase half-life; and 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | AUCInf Area under the plasma concentration-time curve. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------

 
   14

  


Plasma levels of LIQ861, as determined by the area under the curve, which is a pharmacokinetic measurement of drug exposure in blood plasma over time, and the maximum concentration were similar to the data used in connection with the approval of Tyvaso, as reported in the FDA Summary Basis of Approval for Tyvaso. LIQ861 also had a half-life in the blood similar to such data. These results suggest that our formulation has not changed the pharmacokinetic profile of inhaled treprostinil.
 
Non-Clinical Studies
 
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of treprostinil are well understood, having previously been characterized to support approval of Remodulin, which is treprostinil administered through subcutaneous or intravenous infusion, Orenitram®, which is treprostinil administered through extended-release tablets, and Tyvaso, which is treprostinil inhaled through a proprietary nebulizer. We plan to rely in part on the data used in support of FDA approval of these treatments, in addition to our own toxicity studies, to support the development and approval of LIQ861.
 
In October 2016, we completed a 14-day, repeat dose, inhalation toxicity study in rats to support the Phase 1 trial. In August 2017, we completed a 26-week toxicology study in rats. In rats, pharmacokinetic profiles at the end of 14 days of LIQ861 treatment were generally similar to those seen with inhaled nebulized treprostinil delivered at similar treprostinil dose levels. Following 26 weeks of daily dosing, treprostinil exposure was slightly higher in LIQ861-treated rats. The results from this study supported chronic outpatient dosing of LIQ861 in patients with PAH in our Phase 3 trial.
 
Pivotal Phase 3 INSPIRE Trial
 
In August 2019, we completed an open-label Phase 3 clinical trial, INSPIRE, or Investigation of the Safety and Pharmacology of Dry Powder Inhalation of Treprostinil, for LIQ861. The study was conducted at multiple sites in the United States. The primary objective of the INSPIRE study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of LIQ861.
 
The study was designed to evaluate patients who have either been under stable treatment with Tyvaso (nebulizer-delivered treprostinil), for at least three months and were transitioned to LIQ861 under the protocol, or Transition patients, or patients who had been under stable treatment with no more than two non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies for at least three months and then had their treatment regimen supplemented with LIQ861 under the protocol, or Add-On patients. Transition patients were initiated at a capsule strength of LIQ861 lower than their current stable treprostinil dose administered four times daily, while Add-on patients were initiated at 26.5 mcg dose, also administered four times daily. In both cases, LIQ861 was uptitrated in 26.5 mcg treprostinil incremental doses to symptom relief or the limit of tolerance. Within the INSPIRE study, 18 Transition patients were evaluated in a one-directional crossover sub-study comparing bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of treprostinil following dosing of LIQ861 as compared with Tyvaso.
 
   15

  

In March 2019, we reported that we had completed enrollment and met the primary endpoint, which was long-term safety and tolerability, in our INSPIRE trial. LIQ861 was observed to be well-tolerated in 109 patients, with 101 patients (93%) completing at least two months of treatment. During the two-month period, LIQ861 was evaluated at doses up to 159 mcg with no study-drug related serious adverse events. Dosing has exceeded 159 mcg in some patients receiving drug beyond the Month 2 time point. We have not yet determined a maximum tolerated dose of LIQ861. We also reported fully enrolling our one-directional crossover sub-study comparing bioavailability and PK of treprostinil as sub-study patients transitioned from Tyvaso to LIQ861.
 
In April 2019, we reported further data from these 109 patients in our INSPIRE trial on exploratory endpoints at two months of treatment that demonstrated generally favorable results with respect to six-minute walk distance and quality of life as indicated by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, or MLHFQ. In May 2019, we reported further presentation of this data at the ATS International Conference 2019.
 
In June 2019, we reported results from the INSPIRE study indicating that the 79.5 mcg dose of LIQ861 correlates with the 54 mcg dose of Tyvaso (nine breaths), the maximum recommended label dose of Tyvaso. Analysis of the data from the PK sub-study in patients showed variability in systemic plasma levels of both LIQ861 and Tyvaso, which is believed to be attributed to variation in severity of disease and has been seen in prior studies of treprostinil in patients. To more accurately characterize the PK of LIQ861, we conducted two additional PK studies in healthy volunteers. In the first of these studies, we observed unexpected variability in PK levels. Post-hoc analysis showed that plasma levels of treprostinil were tightly correlated to the LIQ861 dose delivered. Based upon additional non-clinical and clinical work, we believe the unexpected variability seen in this healthy volunteer study was due to an administration technique unique to the conduct of the study in the Phase 1 setting. In August 2019, we completed a second PK study in healthy volunteers in which the proper administration technique was followed. This study demonstrated significantly reduced variability, and we believe we have established comparative bioavailability to the reference listed drug. The results of this second supplementary PK study in healthy volunteers are described more fully below.
 
Final enrollment in the pivotal INSPIRE trial included 121 PAH patients to assess safety and tolerability through Month 2, the primary endpoint of the trial. Of the 121 patients enrolled in the study, 55 were Transition patients and 66 were Add-On patients. Add-On patients started on a dose of 26.5 mcg of LIQ861, with most (>80%) titrating to a 79.5 mcg dose or higher within the first two months of treatment. Consistent with preliminary data presented in the second quarter of 2019, LIQ861 was observed to be well-tolerated and treatment-emergent adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in nature at Month 2 up to doses of 159 mcg of LIQ861, the highest dose studied at Month 2. Durability of therapy with LIQ861 appeared to be favorable, with 96% of Transition patients and 91% of Add-On patients remaining on study drug at the Month 2 timepoint.
 
Initial analysis of the exploratory endpoints from the INSPIRE study indicates that LIQ861 may provide functional and quality-of-life benefits to PAH patients in New York Heart Association, or NYHA, functional classes II and III. More than 90% of all patients who completed two months of treatment maintained or improved their NYHA functional class. Additionally, we observed improvement in six-minute-walk-distance and quality of life as measured by the MLHFQ in both patient groups.
 
We continued to treat patients who chose to remain on LIQ861 beyond the Month 2 timepoint of the primary endpoint. More than 80% of INSPIRE patients remained on study drug at Month 4 with no significant changes in safety or tolerability observed compared to Month 2. At the completion of the INSPIRE study, the patient with the longest duration of treatment had been on LIQ861 therapy for 18 months. To provide for continuity of treatment, patients from INSPIRE were provided the opportunity to continue receiving treatment in an extension study, which is currently ongoing.

Supplemental Pharmacokinetic Studies in Healthy Volunteers
 
To complement the pharmacokinetic data from our Phase 3 study, we conducted two additional PK studies in healthy volunteers. In the first of these studies, we observed unexpected variability in PK levels. Post-hoc analysis showed that plasma levels of treprostinil were tightly correlated to the LIQ861 dose delivered. Based upon additional non-clinical and clinical work, we believe the unexpected variability seen in this healthy volunteer study was due to an administration technique unique to the conduct of the study in the Phase 1 setting. In August 2019, we completed a second PK study in healthy volunteers in which the proper administration technique was followed. This study demonstrated significantly reduced variability, and we believe we have established comparative bioavailability to the reference listed drug.
 
Subjects in this second PK study, an open-label, crossover study in healthy volunteers age 18 to 45 years, inclusive, were randomized to one of three treatment sequences, with each sequence consisting of two periods. Each period and dose of LIQ861 and Tyvaso were separated by at least 24 hours. The three treatment sequences, and the number of patients in each, are shown in the table below:
 

Treatment Sequence | Number of Subjects | Period 1 - Day 1 | Period 2 - Day 2
-------------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------
Sequence 1 | 16 | LIQ861 | LIQ861 
Sequence 2 | 4 | Tyvaso | LIQ861 
Sequence 3 | 4 | LIQ861 | Tyvaso 

 
Sequence 1 assessed the reproducibility of plasma treprostinil levels following dosing with 79.5 mcg of LIQ861. Analysis of the results of sequence 1 demonstrated nearly identical PK parameters between the two periods with low variability. Cmax, mean AUCinf and the median time to Cmax (Tmax) following a single dose of 79.5 mcg of LIQ861 were 1.25 ng/ml, 1.01 hr*ng/ml, and 0.17 hours, respectively.
 
Sequences 2 and 3 evaluated the rate and extent of treprostinil exposure following administration of a 79.5 mcg dose of LIQ861 compared with nine breaths of Tyvaso. The absorption rate was comparable between LIQ861 and Tyvaso, with peak concentrations achieved at approximately 0.13 and 0.17 hours (median Tmax) post inhalation for LIQ861 and Tyvaso, respectively. Following peak concentrations, mean plasma concentrations of treprostinil decreased in a monophasic manner with a similar rate of elimination for both treatments (approximate mean half-life of 0.5 hours for LIQ861 and Tyvaso). The comparative bioavailability of treprostinil, as assessed by the geometric mean ratios (LIQ861/Tyvaso) were 0.923, 0.941, and 0.931 for AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax, respectively, and the 90% confidence intervals for these ratios were within the acceptable equivalence limits of 0.80 to 1.25:
 

Parameter | GMR | 90% Confidence Interval | Within subject % Coefficient of Variation
----------+-------+-------------------------+------------------------------------------
AUCinf | 0.923 | 0.802, 1.064 | 14.6 
AUClast | 0.947 | 0.812, 1.103 | 15.8 
Cmax | 0.931 | 0.819, 1.059 | 13.3 

 
This study provided additional data to support our belief that the bioavailability and systemic exposures of treprostinil following a 79.5 mcg dose of LIQ861 and nine breaths of Tyvaso are comparable.
 
NDA Submission
 
Based upon the encouraging results of the INSPIRE trial and the supplemental healthy volunteer pharmacokinetics study, we submitted an NDA for LIQ861 to the FDA in January 2020. Prior to submitting the NDA, we participated in a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA with respect to the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, aspects of the NDA and received no new CMC requirements from the FDA for the NDA submission. We had also requested a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA focused on clinical and nonclinical contents of the NDA. Based on FDA’s responses to our questions in advance of the meeting, or the preliminary meeting comments, we no longer considered the meeting necessary, as we believe that the responses provided sufficient feedback to inform our NDA submission plans.
 
   17

  

Additional Clinical Trials
 
We intend to conduct additional clinical work during and beyond the NDA review period in order to generate additional data on LIQ861 and to support our marketing and commercial activities in advance of a potential launch of LIQ861, including maintaining patients on LIQ861 up to our U.S. launch and conducting a clinical trial in pediatric patients. We also continue to conduct development work in support of potential approval and commercialization of LIQ861, including label and patient-use assessments.
 
We are also currently conducting an additional clinical trial in Europe to study the hemodynamic effects of LIQ861 in PAH patients. Although the FDA has not requested that we undertake this clinical trial, the data may help assess the effects of LIQ861 on acute and chronic hemodynamic measurements and right heart function. Data from this clinical trial may also add to our understanding of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of LIQ861.
 
Commercial Opportunity
 
An independent industry research firm estimated that sales for all major pulmonary hypertension drugs in 2019 would exceed $3.5 billion in the United States. Approved therapies in the prostacyclin pathway may generate approximately $1.7 billion in sales in 2019, more than half of which would include the prostacyclin analog treprostinil generated approximately $915 million from therapies formulated for continuous infusion, inhalation using a nebulizer and oral delivery.
 
If approved, we believe LIQ861 would be the first inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil delivered using a convenient, palm-sized DPI. The dosing regimens and patient experience for the two approved inhaled therapies compared to the expected product profile of LIQ861 are shown in the following table.

Preferred choice within inhaled options. As reported in our market research, physicians and patients expressed a clear preference for the expected product profile of LIQ861 over current nebulized therapies, primarily due to the ease and convenience of administration of LIQ861. Nebulized therapies require more time and breaths than LIQ861, as well as daily and weekly assembly, disassembly and cleaning.
 
Attractive switch from orals. The ease and range of dosing of LIQ861 may be attractive to patients who are in earlier stages of the disease, but poorly managed on oral prostacyclin products. Local delivery of treprostinil to the lung offers fewer systemic side effects. However, we believe some of these patients are hesitant to switch to more burdensome nebulized options.
 
Delay transition to continuous infusion. We are investigating a wide range of LIQ861 doses in order to maximize patient exposure to treprostinil, a key factor in the efficacy of prostacyclin analogs. In our clinical trials, LIQ861 was well tolerated at levels that we estimate are approximately twice the maximum recommended dose of Tyvaso. We believe the dose range enabled by LIQ861 would allow patients to titrate to higher levels of treprostinil and potentially extend the time on inhaled therapy, delaying the eventual transition to continuous infusion.
 
   19

  

Expand beyond WHO Group I patients (PAH). Prostacyclin based therapies have only been approved for WHO Group I patients. However, prostacyclin analogs may have utility in the treatment of PH in other categories, as suggested by current off-label use in WHO Group III, which includes individuals with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung diseases or hypoxemia, and WHO Group IV, which includes individuals with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Although we have no current plans to study LIQ861 in PH patients outside of WHO Group I, we will continue to monitor the investigations conducted by other companies and independent investigators of prostacyclin analogs, especially Tyvaso, and, if appropriate, may consider initiating studies with LIQ861 in patient populations where such agents have been shown to have a therapeutic benefit. In one such recently reported study, United Therapeutics reported positive data in a Phase 3 trial of Tyvaso in a subpopulation of WHO Group III patients with interstitial lung disease, with an estimated prevalence of 30,000 patients in the United States. By 2025, the diagnosed prevalence of all WHO Group III sub-types is expected to grow to over 250,000 patients in the United States, 5EU and Japan. WHO Group IV includes patients diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, or CTEPH. While considered underdiagnosed and undertreated, the current estimates for diagnosed prevalence of CTEPH are between 2,000 and 6,500 patients in the United States and more than 10,000 patients in the 5EU and Japan.
 
Competition in PAH
 
If approved for marketing, we expect that LIQ861 will face competition from the following inhaled treprostinil therapies that are either currently marketed or in clinical development:
 

● | Tyvaso, or inhaled treprostinil, marketed by United Therapeutics, has been approved for the treatment of PAH in the United States since 2009. Tyvaso is administered via a proprietary nebulizer four times per day. Tyvaso is the reference listed drug in our NDA for LIQ861. Following patent litigation, United Therapeutics and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Watson Pharmaceuticals, reached a settlement whereby Watson Pharmaceuticals will be permitted to enter the market with a generic version of Tyvaso beginning on January 1, 2026.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ventavis, or inhaled iloprost, marketed in the United States by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd, or Actelion, a division of Johnson & Johnson, and in Europe by Bayer Schering Pharma AG., has been approved for the treatment of PAH in the United States since 2004. Ventavis is administered via a proprietary nebulizer six to nine times per day.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TreT, an inhaled formulation of treprostinil which United Therapeutics licensed from MannKind Corporation, or MannKind, is currently in late-stage clinical development in the United States for the treatment of PAH. Under the license agreement, United Therapeutics is responsible for global development, regulatory and commercial activities. MannKind will manufacture clinical supplies and initial commercial supplies of the product while long-term commercial supplies will be manufactured by United Therapeutics. In September 2019, United Therapeutics commenced a clinical study (BREEZE) to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of switching PAH patients from Tyvaso to TreT and announced plans to commence a second clinical study during the first half of 2020 to compare the pharmacokinetics of TreT to Tyvaso in healthy volunteers. United Therapeutics further reported that the two studies, if successful, are the only clinical studies necessary to support FDA approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to these other inhaled treprostinil therapies, we expect that LIQ861 will also face competition from other treprostinil-based drugs, including Orenitram, which is administered orally, and Remodulin, which is administered parenterally, both of which are marketed by United Therapeutics. Other agents that utilize the prostacyclin pathway include parenteral epoprostenol, which is marketed by multiple companies as generic and branded products. Because parenteral agents are considered to offer the greatest efficacy, but also carry the most significant side effects related to infusion site pain, risk of infection, and significant limitations on quality of life, they are usually reserved for patients later in the course of the disease.
 
In addition to therapies based upon prostacyclin analogues, other classes of therapeutic agents for the treatment of PAH, all of which are delivered orally, include the following:
 

● | IP-agonists, such as selexipag, marketed by Actelion, and ralinepeg, licensed from Arena Pharmaceuticals by United Therapeutics, which is currently in clinical development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PDE-5 inhibitors, such as tadalafil, marketed by United Therapeutics, and sildenafil, marketed by Pfizer. Generic versions of both tadalafil and sildenafil are currently available.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and macitentan, both marketed by Actelion, and ambrisentan, marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. Generic version of bosentan and ambrisentan are currently available.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, such as riociguat marketed by Bayer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   20

  

In addition, we are also aware of several agents currently in clinical development in the United States for the treatment of PAH, including those in development by Insmed Inc. and Acceleron Pharma, Inc.
 
In addition to use in patients who have typically been treated with inhaled agents, we believe that LIQ861 may provide an attractive therapeutic option for patients who are in earlier stages of the disease, but poorly managed on oral prostacyclin analogues. Additionally, we believe that because of the ability to provide higher doses of treprostinil with LIQ861, patients may be able to remain on LIQ861 longer before initiating parenteral treprostinil therapy than might be the case with other inhaled treprostinil therapies.
 
LIQ865
 
Our second product candidate, LIQ865, which is designed using PRINT technology, is an injectable, sustained-release formulation of bupivacaine, a non-opioid pain medication for the management of local post-operative pain for three to five days through a single administration after a surgical procedure. If approved, we believe LIQ865 would have the potential to provide significantly longer local post-operative pain relief compared to currently marketed formulations of bupivacaine.
 
Background on Post-Operative Pain
 
The treatment of post-operative pain typically involves multi-modal therapy including the administration of local anesthetics after surgery. Although local anesthetics provide a well-established, safe and efficacious option for post-operative pain management, the duration of efficacy for conventional local anesthetics, including bupivacaine and lidocaine, is limited, with pain relief typically lasting for eight hours or less. Because post-operative pain may continue to be severe for several days following surgery, additional therapies are required. These therapies include morphine and other opioids administered orally or parenterally, as well as various non-opioids, including acetaminophen and NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and ketorolac.
 
Current Therapies and Their Limitations
 
Opioids are the mainstay of post-operative pain management, but they are associated with a variety of potentially serious or life-threatening side effects such as sedation, nausea, constipation, cognitive impairment, and respiratory depression. In addition, opioids may be administered through patient-controlled analgesia systems, which may interfere with or delay patient ambulation and require significant hospital resources to implement and monitor. Furthermore, exposure to opioids for as little as four days can lead to increased risk of chronic opioid use and addiction. The risk of opioid abuse has led physicians, payors and the U.S. federal government to prioritize pain management strategies that minimize the use of opioids.
 
NSAIDs and other non-opioids for pain relief in the post-operative period are also associated with various side effects, including bleeding and gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acetaminophen can cause liver injury or failure with excessive dosing. As a result, we believe there is demand from healthcare providers and patients for post-operative pain relief therapies that can help prevent these issues.
 
Local anesthetics such as bupivacaine hydrochloride, or Marcaine, and lidocaine have been safely used for post-operative pain for decades, but have a duration of effect limited to less than eight hours. Approved in 2011, EXPAREL is a long-acting local anesthetic that involves an injection of bupivacaine in a multivesicular liposome carrier at the surgical site and is marketed in the United States by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Physicians report that EXPAREL typically provides post-surgical analgesia for only 24 to 36 hours in practice, and market research we conducted suggests that physicians desire longer duration of effect to better manage local post-operative pain. In addition, because the interactions between the liposomal formulation of EXPAREL and co-administered local anesthetics can result in rapid release of bupivacaine, co-administration of other local anesthetics is inadvisable.
 
   21

  

Potential Benefits of LIQ865
 
Using our PRINT technology, we have developed a particle formulation of bupivacaine designed to improve the management of local post-operative pain. We engineered the size and composition of LIQ865 particles to slowly release bupivacaine with the goal of providing patients with local pain relief for three to five days through a single administration, which we believe would provide significantly longer local post-operative pain relief compared to currently marketed formulations of bupivacaine. The figure below depicts LIQ865, showing size consistency among particles.
 

LIQ865 is administered as a suspension and is easily injected at the surgical site. Because the molded drug particles are highly stable, we believe the potential for dose dumping, the unintended rapid drug release of bupivacaine from the carrier, would be minimized with LIQ865. In a non-clinical study, co-administration of LIQ865 with lidocaine did not cause early release of bupivacaine or otherwise negatively affect the pharmacokinetic profile of LIQ865. LIQ865 was engineered to be rapidly reconstituted and administered by injection. Unlike other sustained-release formulations, we do not expect LIQ865 will be constrained by a specific ratio of drug to diluting agent, so its reconstitution volume can be adjusted based on the volume needs of a particular procedure. Furthermore, because particle-to-particle uniformity in size and composition is key to determining drug release rates, the uniformity of our LIQ865 particles creates consistent release rates.
 
Non-Clinical Efficacy Studies
 
We commissioned an animal efficacy study of two formulations of LIQ865 in a rat perineural sciatic model, which was completed in January 2016. LIQ865 showed an extended pharmacokinetic profile and duration of nerve sensory block and the potential for extended post-operative pain management. Additionally, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of LIQ865 in a rat toxicology study in 2016. The results of this study supported advancing LIQ865 into human clinical trials.
Phase 1 Trials
 
Our Phase 1a trial, completed in March 2017, was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, single ascending dose trial of two different PRINT formulations of bupivacaine, LIQ865A and LIQ865B. The trial was conducted in 28 healthy male volunteers at a single site in Copenhagen, Denmark. LIQ865A consists of particles combining bupivacaine and polylactic-glycolic acid, a polymer widely used in sustained-release drug products and surgical sutures. LIQ865B consists of particles of bupivacaine alone, in a proprietary diluting agent. The study design included dosing multiple cohorts, or groups, each receiving increasing bupivacaine doses as either LIQ865A or LIQ865B: 150 mg, 225 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg or 600 mg. The LIQ865 formulation was injected into the upper calf in one leg, and the other leg received the diluting agent without LIQ865 particles. The primary objective of this Phase 1a clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of the two formulations of LIQ865. We also assessed bupivacaine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses.
 
We observed a dose-response relationship in this trial, and all doses were well-tolerated. The results from this trial helped inform our selection of LIQ865A for further investigation in the United States, and all of our references to LIQ865 are to this formulation. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and most adverse events were limited locally at the site of injection, with most related to sensory block of underlying sensory branches of the saphenous nerve in the leg.

Mean plasma concentrations of bupivacaine over 120 hours comparing the 150 mg, 225 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg and 600 mg dose cohorts of LIQ865A formulation, expressed on a logarithmic, or log, scale for the 16 volunteers who received LIQ865A are shown below:
 
LIQ865A Log Linear Mean Concentration Over Time


At the 450 mg dose of LIQ865, all subjects had maximum concentration values below 800 ng/ml, which is well below the reported thresholds for neurotoxicity and cardiac toxicity of 2,000 and 4,000 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile for this dose suggested a sustained duration of effect, with nearly all subjects receiving this dose reporting at least three days of sensory blunting in response to quantitative sensory testing. LIQ865 also showed rapid onset of action at the one-hour time point in all subjects, even at the lowest dose of 150 mg. Additionally, we observed a block of the distal sensory branches of the saphenous nerve below the knee in eight of nine subjects who received a 450 mg dose of LIQ865. This sensory block lasted at least three days, which we believe further supports the duration profile of LIQ865.
 
In March 2017, we held a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and verified that the CMC and preclinical package were “phase-appropriate” and sufficient to support our initial U.S. Phase 1 trial. Following our submission of the IND for LIQ865, we initiated our U.S. Phase 1b clinical trial in September 2017, which was completed in April 2018. This trial used an experimental pain model in healthy male and female subjects with quantitative sensory testing after an injection of LIQ865 at doses of 150 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg. The experimental pain model was designed to simulate post-operative pain for up to five days through a combination of localized ultraviolet B burn and mini-incision. Additionally, the trial included a cross-over design to compare LIQ865 to EXPAREL. We observed that LIQ865 was well-tolerated across the range of doses. All adverse events were mild to moderate, and no dose-limiting toxicities were noted. The pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that observed in the Phase 1a trial. Pharmacodynamic effects were highly variable and inconclusive, which we associated with the experimental design of the pain model used in this Phase 1b trial.
 
   23

  

Plans for Phase 2 Development
 
At our pre-IND meeting in March 2017, the FDA requested additional toxicology studies prior to the initiation of Phase 2 trials. Accordingly, we initiated Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies in 2019 to assess LIQ865 in multiple non-clinical tissue models. Results from a study to assess incision tensile strength after healing were acceptable and not statistically different from controls. A nonclinical study to examine soft tissue healing was also completed, and the results were acceptable and comparable to vehicle-treated, saline-treated, and Marcaine-treated sites. We believe this data supports progression to Phase 2 hernia repair studies. In a study to assess bone fracture healing, we observed dose-dependent delayed healing at the two LIQ865 doses studied; however, there were no adverse effects noted on surrounding soft tissues. Additional studies have been initiated with lower doses of LIQ865 to determine a NOAEL on bone healing. We will review the results from these toxicology studies, and if supportive, we intend to initiate  Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trials, subject to availability of capital and other factors, during 2021. In the United States, we plan to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our development of LIQ865, which would allow us to rely on the FDA’s prior determinations of safety and efficacy for other products containing bupivacaine, such as Marcaine and EXPAREL.
Competition
 
The primary competitor for LIQ865, if approved, would be liposomal bupivacaine, marketed as EXPAREL by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Generic equivalents of EXPAREL may also enter the market when EXPAREL loses patent protection, potentially as early as December 2021. While EXPAREL is currently the only direct competitor to LIQ865 on the market, in October 2018 Heron Therapeutics, Inc., or Heron, announced the submission of its NDA to the FDA for HTX-011, an investigational long-acting, extended-release formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam for the management of post-operative pain. HTX-011 was granted both breakthrough therapy and fast track designations, as well as priority review, by the FDA. In May 2019, Heron announced that it received a complete response letter, or CRL, for HTX-011 from the FDA. In October 2019, Heron announced that it had resubmitted its NDA for HTX-011 to the FDA and expected a six-month review period. In addition to Heron, Durect Corporation and Innocoll Holdings plc each also have products in clinical development that are potential competitors to LIQ865. In addition to long-acting local anesthetics, there are a number of indirect competitors in various stages of research and development, including opioids and other molecules that target the treatment of pain through alternative pathways.
Our PRINT Technology
 
Both LIQ861 and LIQ865 are being developed using our proprietary PRINT particle engineering technology, which allows us to engineer and manufacture highly uniform drug particles with precise control over the size, three-dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition of the particles. By controlling these physical and chemical parameters of particles, PRINT enables us to engineer desirable pharmacological benefits into product candidates, including prolonged duration of drug release, increased drug loading, more convenient routes of administration, the ability to create novel combination products, enhanced storage and stability and the potential to reduce adverse side effects. Precisely controlling the physical and chemical characteristics of drug particles enables us to research, identify and pursue the improvement of existing therapies and creation of new therapies from existing drugs or new chemical entities, including small molecules and biologics.
 
Our ability to design and control these features of drug particles has the potential to provide significant benefits across the breadth of pharmaceutical applications. Product characteristics and features can be tuned depending on the need of a particular application, drug substance, delivery route and other such considerations. Based on our research to date, we anticipate the ability to:
 

● | enhance inhaled delivery through the highly uniform geometric size, shape and composition of each drug particle;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   24

  


● | design desired drug release profiles ranging from minutes post-delivery to days, weeks, or months depending on the objective of a target therapy, by controlling the chemical composition of the drug particles and the surface area-to-volume ratio of the particles;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enable combination products where one or more of the chemical constituents can destabilize or interact by encapsulating the desired constituent in a particle to shield it from another constituent during packaging and storage; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enhance the deposition and retention of topically delivered products by designing particles with a desired charge and/or Young’s modulus.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our molding approach, which we branded as “PRINT” or Particle Replication In Non-wetting Templates, combines the precision of the semi-conductor industry with the high throughput of roll-to-roll manufacturing to make highly uniform micro- and nano-particles at a commercially viable scale. Our manufacturing equipment and materials used in the production of our drug particles are proprietary and protected by our patent portfolio and trade secret know-how. Our PRINT equipment is also modular, scalable and cost-effective.
 
Our PRINT Process
 
We begin our particle design by procuring a custom designed master template etched with three-dimensional structures, or posts, that will become the eventual shape and size of our drug particles. These three-dimensional structures are then replicated in negative form, through our proprietary processing, into flexible rolls of polymeric PRINT molds. Our PRINT molds consist of thousands of linear feet of thin flexible molds up to twenty-four inches wide. We then design and formulate our desired drug particle composition and apply that to our PRINT molds in our high-throughput roll-to-roll processing equipment, with each particle mimicking the shape of the mold cavity from which it was molded, thus taking the shape of the original master template structures.
 
The general components and steps of our PRINT molding are as follows:
 

● | Step A: Etch a master template with the three-dimensional geometric structures of the desired particle size and shape;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step B: Apply our proprietary polymeric mold material over the master template;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step C: Cure the polymeric material to form our PRINT molds with discrete molding cavities that replicate the structures of the master template;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step D: Design the chemical composition of the drug particle of interest;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step E: Apply the drug particle composition to the cavities in the mold to fill the cavities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step F: Form the drug particles in the cavities of the mold that mimic the size and shape of the mold cavities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step G: Remove the drug particles from the mold cavities on a harvesting film; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Step H: Remove the particles from the harvesting film for further functionalization, purification or packaging to be included in the final drug particle product.

The diagram below shows the general steps involved in producing drug particles using our PRINT technology:
 

We have translated the PRINT process into a continuous, roll-to-roll manufacturing process that we believe is compliant with cGMP and scaled to support clinical and commercial production, when required. One of our current manufacturing lines is shown below:
 

   26

  

Manufacturing and Supply
 
Our facilities occupy approximately 45,000 square feet and are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. Within these premises, there are office space, research and development laboratories and equipment, analytical development and quality control laboratories, research, development and mold production facilities, research and development particle fabrication equipment, including three operational PRINT particle fabrication lines, all of which we believe are cGMP-compliant, as well as appropriate staging, storage and stability facilities. These three operational PRINT particle fabrication lines are located within class ISO7 clean rooms that operate under applicable ISO and cGMP air quality and environmental requirements.
 
We currently produce in this facility the product candidates for our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our current operational PRINT particle fabrication lines are scaled and capable of producing the necessary materials to support our ongoing operations and planned studies and clinical trials and, we believe, ultimately our initial commercial scale manufacturing. The production capacity for each PRINT particle fabrication line within our production facility varies depending on the drug particle that is being produced.
 
We depend on third-party suppliers for clinical supplies, including active pharmaceutical ingredients which are used in our product candidates. For example, we currently rely on a sole supplier, LGM Pharma, LLC, or LGM Pharma, for treprostinil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of LIQ861, and we currently rely on a sole supplier, Plastiape S.p.A., or Plastiape, for RS00 Model 8 DPI, the DPI used to administer LIQ861. We also rely on a sole supplier, Xcelience LLC (now a Lonza Group Ltd company), or Xcelience, for encapsulation and packaging services. If and when we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, we may, from time to time, rely on third-party CMOs to produce, package and distribute some or all of our approved drug products on a commercial scale.
 
Our Collaboration and Licensing Agreements
 
In addition to advancing our own product candidates, LIQ861 and LIQ865, we have collaborated, and may consider collaborating, with pharmaceutical companies to develop their own product candidates across a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration, leveraging our PRINT technology. These collaborations are intended to help advance new PRINT capabilities and build upon our competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical industry, while adding to our intellectual property portfolio.
 
We have exclusively licensed our PRINT technology to GSK for applications broadly across inhaled delivery of their small molecule and biologic chemical entities, although we retained the ability to develop LIQ861. As discussed below, in June 2019, we amended our Inhaled Collaboration and Option Agreement, or the GSK ICO Agreement, with GSK, to secure rights to develop and commercialize three additional inhaled therapeutics, subject to milestone and royalty payments to GSK, and to establish a mechanism by which we may acquire rights to develop and commercialize further molecular entities for inhaled applications.
 
We have also exclusively licensed our PRINT technology to Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which in 2017 acquired most of the assets of Envisia Therapeutics, Inc., an entity which we formed in 2013, for broad usage in the design and commercialization of small molecule and biologic ophthalmic therapies.
 
GlaxoSmithKline
 
Previously, we had collaborated with GSK on the use of our PRINT technology in respiratory disease. In June 2012, we entered into the GSK ICO Agreement with GSK to collaborate on research regarding the application of our PRINT technology to specified inhaled therapies. Pursuant to the GSK ICO Agreement, we granted GSK exclusive options and licenses to further develop and commercialize such inhaled therapies using our PRINT technology. In partial consideration of the rights granted to GSK under the GSK ICO Agreement, we received a one-time up-front payment of $4.0 million. We also entered into a stock purchase agreement with GSK pursuant to which GSK purchased 4,765,248 shares of our Series C-1 convertible preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of $3.8 million.
 
   27

  

In September 2015, GSK exercised its option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to certain of our know-how and patents relating to our PRINT technology, for the purpose of, among others, preclinical studies of inhaled therapeutics developed, manufactured or otherwise produced using our PRINT technology. In connection with the grant of this license, we received a one-time option exercise fee of $15.0 million. Under the terms of the GSK ICO Agreement, we were also entitled to continued research and development funding and certain milestone payments aggregating up to $158 million upon the achievement of specified events for new non-rescue therapeutic products. Rescue therapeutic products are therapeutics that GSK develops with our PRINT technology that had previously been discontinued from development. We are also entitled to tiered royalties on the worldwide sales of the licensed products at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to low-single digits depending on the total number of products developed and other royalty step-down events with a fixed low-single digit royalty floor. In February 2016, we received a $3.0 million payment from GSK upon the achievement of a clinical development milestone related to the development of an inhaled antiviral for viral exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, in July 2018, GSK notified us of its plans to discontinue development of this compound after completion of the related Phase 1 clinical trial.
 
GSK has the right to terminate the GSK ICO Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis upon a specified period of prior written notice. Upon termination of the GSK ICO Agreement, each party will continue to have the right to practice and/or license its interest in any know-how developed during the collaboration without seeking the consent of, or accounting to, the other party.
 
In June 2019, we and GSK executed the third amendment to the collaboration agreement providing us with rights to develop and commercialize three specified molecular entities for application in inhaled programs using our PRINT technology at our sole expense. This amendment also provides a mechanism for us to acquire rights to develop and commercialize further molecular entities for inhaled applications. New inhaled programs developed under this amendment would carry milestone and royalty payments due to GSK upon initiation of Phase 3 studies and subsequent commercialization, respectively. This amendment, among other factors, including the lack of continued performance anticipated by the Company and GSK under the original agreement, led the Company to the belief that no further research and development services will be provided to GSK under the collaboration agreement. Accordingly, in January 2020, we notified GSK of our intent to terminate the GSK ICO Agreement based upon GSK's lack of performance under the agreement, which we believe constitutes a material breach of the agreement. In February 2020, we received a letter from GSK disputing our basis for termination.  The parties are currently attempting to resolve the dispute pursuant to the terms of the GSK ICO Agreement.
 
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
 
In December 2008, we entered into the Amended and Restated License Agreement with UNC for the use of certain patent rights and technology relating to initial innovations of our PRINT technology, or the UNC License. Under the terms of the UNC License, we have an exclusive license to such patent rights and technology for our drug products. The UNC License grants us the right to grant sublicenses to the technology as well as control the litigation of any infringement claim instituted by or against us in respect of the licensed patent rights. We are also responsible for the costs of all expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and patent applications. Such filings and prosecution will be carried out by UNC and in UNC’s name but under our control.
 
Under the UNC License, we are required to pay UNC royalties equal to a low single digit percentage of all net sales of our drug products whose manufacture, use or sale includes any use of the technology or patent rights covered by the UNC License, as well as tiered royalty percentages ranging in the low single digits of sales by our sublicensees for any product covered by rights under a sublicense agreement granted pursuant to the UNC License. Under the UNC License, we are also required to pay UNC 20% of all fees other than royalties that we collect and are attributable to UNC sublicensed intellectual property. As consideration for the UNC License, we paid UNC a license issue fee in the form of 196,469 shares of our Class B non-voting common stock in 2004. During the term of the UNC License, we have also paid approximately $2.9 million in the aggregate to UNC pursuant to a Supported Research Agreement, or the SRA. In connection therewith, we may exclusively license resulting inventions under the SRA for a $5,000 up-front license fee per invention. We have also paid aggregate consideration of $5.7 million in sublicense fees to UNC pursuant to the UNC License, for our sublicenses of our PRINT technology to GSK and G&W Laboratories, Inc., a former licensee. We also reimburse UNC for its costs of procuring and maintaining the patents we license from UNC. Such reimbursements amounted to $142,531 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Effective November 2017, we satisfied all substantive milestones associated with our UNC License other than semi-annual and annual reporting-based milestones that continue through the term of the UNC License. The UNC License expires (i) on the expiration of the last to expire patent included in the patent rights or (ii) if no patents mature from such patent rights, in December 2028.
 
   28

  

We have the right to terminate the UNC License upon a specified period of prior written notice. UNC may terminate the UNC License in certain circumstances, including if we fail to pay royalty or other payments on time or if we fail to sublicense in accordance with the terms of the UNC License. Upon termination of the UNC License, we must pay any royalty obligations due upon termination.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The proprietary nature and protection of our product candidates, their methods of use and our platform technology that enables our product candidates are an important part of our business strategy of rapidly developing and commercializing new medicines that address areas of significant unmet medical needs.
 
Our policy is to seek patent protection of our proprietary product candidates and technology by filing U.S., international and certain foreign patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the growth and protection of our business. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to patent protection or where we do not consider patent protection to be adequate or applicable.
 
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection for our product candidates, enabling technology, inventions and know-how and our ability to defend and enforce these patents, preserve the proprietary nature of our trade secrets and trademarks and operate our business without infringing valid and enforceable patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. We pursue both composition-of-matter patents and method-of-use patents for our product candidates. We are also pursuing patents covering our proprietary PRINT micro- and nano-particle fabrication technology.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application to which the patent claims priority in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, or PTA, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension, or PTE, of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended. Further, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the extension only applies to the approved drug, method for using it or method for manufacturing it for which the extension was obtained. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
 
We are the owner or exclusive licensee of patents and applications relating to our proprietary technology platform and our product candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for these and for our other product candidates and technology developments.
 
We have a total of 159 patents and pending patent applications in our patent portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, we were the sole owner of 14 patents in the United States and 41 patents in foreign jurisdictions, as well as approximately 16 additional pending patent applications, including provisional patent applications, in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions. In addition to the patents and patent applications owned solely by us, our patent portfolio also includes 72 patents and 16 patent applications licensed from third parties. As of December 31, 2019, we had an exclusive, worldwide license from UNC to 18 U.S. patents and 53 foreign patents, as well as six additional patent applications in the United States or selected foreign jurisdictions. Five of the patents and two of the patent applications in the portfolio licensed from UNC are jointly owned by us.

We hold multiple U.S. trademark registrations and have numerous pending trademark applications. Issuance of a federally registered trademark creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership of the mark; however, it is subject to challenge by others claiming first use in the mark in some or all the areas in which it is used. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life so long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We believe our patents and trademarks are valuable and would provide us certain benefits in marketing our products.

Sales and Marketing
 
We hold worldwide commercialization rights to LIQ861 and LIQ865. We are currently exploring opportunities to commercialize LIQ861 in the United States, subject to receiving regulatory approval, either by ourselves or through partnership or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. With respect to LIQ865, after reviewing the results of all of our Phase 2-enabling toxicology studies, and subject to the availability of sufficient funding, we plan to evaluate whether to pursue continued internal development or to explore licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. Outside of the United States, we intend to pursue the regulatory approval and commercialization of LIQ861 and LIQ865 through licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies with regional expertise. We have not yet established a substantial commercial organization or distribution capabilities.
 
If we decide to commercialize LIQ861, our lead product candidate, ourselves, we intend to focus our commercial efforts initially on the U.S. market, which we believe represents the largest market opportunity. Within the United States, we believe that we can effectively commercialize LIQ861, if approved, with an initial specialty field team of approximately 50 individuals. We intend to initially pursue a highly concentrated target market of PAH centers of excellence and high prescribers of PAH therapies. Our physician call points within these sites of care will include cardiologists, pulmonologists and their supporting staff. We expect to supplement our field team with medical science liaisons and reimbursement specialists to support the proper training and utilization of LIQ861. As part of our commercialization strategy, we plan to educate physician specialists, healthcare practitioners, patients and caregivers of the benefits of LIQ861 and its proper use. We plan to work with national associations, such as the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, and patient advocacy groups to update treatment guidelines to include LIQ861.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid and significant technological change and places emphasis on the value of proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies and experience provide us with a competitive advantage, our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, biopharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large, established companies.
 
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than products that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and non-competitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among others, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel, establish clinical trial sites and secure patient enrollment in our clinical trials, and identify appropriate collaborators to help commercialize any approved products in our target commercial markets.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2019, we had 64 total employees, all of which are full-time, including seven employees in management (including our executive officers), 22 employees in research and development, 16 employees in manufacturing and technical operations, seven employees in regulatory and quality and 12 employees in general and administration. All of our employees are employed in the United States.

Government Regulation
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, (including manufacturing changes), quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations.
 
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA, containing the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, to request approval to market the drug product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   33

  


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA;
--+------------------------------------


● | payment of fees, including annual program fees for each drug product on the market; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ongoing compliance with any post approval requirements, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and post approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. When a sponsor wants to proceed to test the product candidate in humans, it must submit an IND in order to conduct clinical trials.
 
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
 
All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
 
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
 
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 
   34

  

Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
There are FDA-imposed limitations on communications about investigational drugs. The FDA prohibits companies from making promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation, and from “commercialization” of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution.
 
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product.
 
The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program user fees.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an NDA application (or a supplement to an application) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must contain a Pediatric Assessment. If so, the submission must contain data from pediatric studies that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral. PREA applies only to products developed for diseases that occur in both adult and pediatric populations, and generally does not apply to products with Orphan Drug Designation or to ANDAs for generic drugs.
 
   35

  

A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that is subject to the PREA requirements must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP. The FDA encourages all applications to submit the PSP as soon as possible in the drug development process, and to discuss the plan with FDA at critical points in the development process. For products intended for life-threatening or severely debilitating illnesses, applicants are encouraged to discuss the PSP at the Pre-IND meeting and End-of-Phase 1 meeting. For products not intended for such illnesses, the FDA recommends that sponsors submit and discuss the PSP no later than the End-of-Phase 2, or EOP2, meeting. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical studies or other clinical development programs. The sponsor may submit a request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. It is critical that sponsors are in compliance with the PREA, as non-compliance may result in the FDA considering the drug product misbranded solely on that basis.
 
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
 
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use, which includes assessment of preclinical and clinical data; proposed labeling; CMC data; and an assessment of whether the manufacturing processes and facilities meet the appropriate requirements and comply with the applicable regulations (including cGMP requirements and adequate assurance for consistent commercial production of the product within required specifications). There are numerous FDA personnel assigned to review different aspects of an NDA, exercising judgment, discretion, and interpretation of data relative to the review process.
 
The FDA may approve an NDA only if, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture processing, packing and testing of the product are adequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality and purity.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA often will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured.
 
The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.
 
Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure clinical data supporting the submission were developed in compliance with GCP.
 
   36

  

The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional preclinical, clinical or CMC data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies, as well as other types of supporting data, are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.
 
After the FDA’s evaluation of an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing.
 
Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further assess safety and effectiveness after approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
New Drug Applications
 
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA (described above) for innovator products, or an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the Hatch-Waxman Act amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are also referred to as listed drugs). Because the safety and efficacy of listed drugs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require new human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of generic products. Rather, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. For some drugs, including locally acting drugs such as topical anti-fungals, other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the FDA, especially where rate and/or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. In addition to the bioequivalence data, an ANDA must contain patent certifications and chemistry, manufacturing, labeling and stability data.
 
A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
   37

  

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the reference listed drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
 
If the reference NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Thus approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be prevented until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
Combination Products
 
Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices are regulated as “combination products” in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories, such as drug/device, device/biologic or drug/biologic. The term combination product includes: (i) a product comprised of two or more regulated components (i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity); (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, such as to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect.
 
Each constituent part of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of constituent part, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product, and typically one application, such as for a drug/device combination product assigned to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, an NDA, will be made.

A device with the primary purpose of delivering or aiding in the delivery of a drug and distributed containing a drug (i.e., a “prefilled delivery system”) is typically evaluated by CDER using drug authorities and device authorities, as necessary.
 
A device with the primary purpose of delivering or aiding in the delivery of a drug and that is distributed without the drug (i.e., unfilled) is typically evaluated by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health and CDER, respectively, unless the intended use of the two products, through labeling, creates a combination product.
 
The FDA has indicated that dry powder inhalers, such as our lead product candidate, LIQ861, are drug/device combination products.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, drug supply chain security surveillance and tracking requirements, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also, under The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, continuing, annual FDA “program fee” requirements for products once they are approved, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. Combination products are subject to FDA regulation to ensure the quality of both the constituent parts and the finished product.
 
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
   39

  

Potential implications include required revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. As a compliance best practice and risk mitigation measure, pharmaceutical companies typically train their sales force regarding the limitations on promotion of products relative to their approved indications for use and concerns regarding potential “off-label promotion.” However, a physician may use products off-label, when in the physician’s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems it appropriate. Recent court decisions have impacted FDA’s enforcement activity regarding off-label promotion in the light of First Amendment considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area in part due to the potential for False Claims Act exposure. Further, the FDA as not materially changed its position on off-label promotion following legal setbacks on First Amendment grounds and the U.S. Department of Justice has consistently asserted in False Claims Act briefings that “speech serves as a conduit for violations of the law is not constitutionally protected.”
 
The distribution of prescription drugs is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulates the distribution of the products at the federal level, and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain and regulation of manufacturers and repackagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers. The DSCSA preempts certain previously enacted state pedigree laws and upon taking effect superseded the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA. Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met, and are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Further, the DSCSA limits the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products and imposes requirements to ensure overall accountability and security in the drug supply chain. Product identifier information (an aspect of the product tracing scheme) is also now required. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system of product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in over a period of years through 2023, and subject companies will need to continue their implementation efforts. Many states still have in place licensure and other requirements for manufacturers and distributors of drug products. The distribution of product samples continues to be regulated under the PDMA, and some states also impose regulations on drug sample distribution.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

Patent Term Restoration
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a sixty day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any PTE or restoration. In the future, we may apply for PTEs, defined as the length of the regulatory review of products covered by our granted patents, for some of our currently owned or licensed applications and patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates. Such extensions will depend on the length of the regulatory review; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study that “fairly responds” to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Some of the additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement levels imposed by third-party payors influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication, or place drugs at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors.
 
   41

  

Reimbursement may also impact the demand for drug products that obtain marketing approval. If coverage for a drug product is obtained by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Further, third party payors require onerous prior approvals or implement other forms of restricted access that make it difficult for patients to utilize our drug products. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Prescribing physicians are unlikely to use or prescribe drug products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of those drug products. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, a drug product which has obtained marketing approval may not be successfully commercialized.
 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. For example, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about pricing practices in connection with an investigation into pricing practices being conducted by the DOJ. Several state attorneys general also have commenced drug pricing investigations and filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, and the U.S. Senate has publicly investigated a number of pharmaceutical companies relating to price increases and pricing practices. Proposed legislation has been designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Recent federal budget proposals have included measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. The U.S. Congress and the Trump Administration have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and administrative measures to control drug costs, including by addressing the role of pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, in the supply chain. Drug pricing is and will remain a key bipartisan issue in the coming year. If drug pricing reform is not meaningfully addressed before the 2020 election, policies to be pursued in the future may be more aggressive, regardless of which party controls the White House. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs and product candidates from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals. We anticipate that current and future U.S. federal and state legislative proposals may result in additional downward pressure on drug pricing and reimbursement, which could have a significant impact on our business.
 
In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any currently marketed products and product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers, and our sales, marketing and educational activities, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations (at the federal and state level) that may constrain our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval.
 
In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:
 

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities including pharmaceutical manufacturers from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to, among other things, arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, waivers of payment, ownership interest and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. The failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability in all cases. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a per se false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to, or approval by, the federal government that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. Although we do not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, marketing products of sub-standard quality, or, as noted above, paying a kickback that results in a claim for items or services. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also constitute a violation of the False Claims Act. Although the False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. Additionally, the federal government has pursued electronic health record, or HER, vendors and pharmaceutical manufacturers for remunerative relationships involving the EHR platform’s recommendation of particular drugs and “prompting” technology to increase prescribing of particular drugs.

   43

  


● | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347, prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. § 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. These statutes are not limited to items and services reimbursed by a governmental health care program and have been used to prosecute commercial insurance fraud as well.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The exclusion statute requires the exclusion of entities and individuals who have been convicted of federal-program related crimes or health care felony fraud or controlled substance charges. The statute also permits the exclusion of those that have been convicted of any form of fraud, the Anti-Kickback Statute, for obstructing an investigation or audit, misdemeanor controlled substance charges, those whose health care license has been revoked or suspended, and those who have filed claims for excessive charges or unnecessary services. If a company were to be excluded, its products would be ineligible for reimbursement from any federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and no other entity participating in those programs would be permitted to enter into contracts with the company. Further, employment or contracting with an individual or entity that has been excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs could serve as a basis to invalidate claims for items or services submitted by that entity and to exclude that entity from participation in such programs as well. In order to preserve access to beneficial drugs, the government may elect to exclude officers and key employees of manufacturers, rather than excluding the organization. Such enforcement actions would prohibit us from engaging those individuals, which could adversely affect operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business. We are not a covered entity under HIPAA and have not functioned as a business associate under HIPAA that would cause the HIPAA Security Rule and provisions of the Privacy Rule to apply directly to us as a business associate. To the extent that we ever function in a business associate capacity, however, HIPAA, as amended by as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose, among other things, obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office for Civil Rights, or the OCR, has increased its focus on compliance and continues to train state attorneys general for enforcement purposes. The OCR has recently increased both its efforts to audit HIPAA compliance and its level of enforcement, with one recent penalty exceeding $5 million. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, and may apply more broadly thus complicating compliance efforts (for example, California recently enacted legislation — the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA — which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and among other things, created new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provided new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information, and created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach; the California Attorney General will issue final regulations, and although the law includes limited exceptions, including for certain information collected as part of clinical trials as specified in the law, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context, and it remains unclear what language the final Attorney General regulations will contain or how the statute and the regulations will be interpreted.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Federal legislation enacted in 2018 has extended the scope of reporting requirements to apply to payments and transfers of value to not only physicians, but also physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners (with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.

● | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and in some cases may apply regardless of payor (i.e., even for self-pay scenarios). Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report pricing and marketing information, including, among other things, information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, requirements related to drug sample distribution, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information and the use of prescriber-identifiable data in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

● | Price reporting laws that require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursements or discounts on our drug products.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that certain business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business, even if the government ultimately finds that no violation has occurred.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, contained several provisions affecting the pharmaceutical industry:

● | the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of HHS, as a condition of Medicare Part B and Medicaid coverage of the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer;

● | the ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 70% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., the donut hole);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ACA implemented the Physician Payments Sunshine Act;

● | the ACA requires annual reporting of drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ACA expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States, including the False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ACA established a licensing framework for follow-on biologics; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ACA established the new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with the funding for such research.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Trump Administration and the Congressional Republicans have proposed several efforts to repeal and replace the ACA. President Trump has also signed Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Additionally, on December 15, 2019, a federal district court in Texas struck down the ACA in its entirety, finding that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional. The judge further concluded in Texas v. Azar that since the individual mandate is “essential” to the ACA, it could not be severed from the rest of the ACA and therefore, the entire ACA was unconstitutional. Despite its decision, however, the court did not issue an injunction and therefore, immediate compliance is not required. In addition, the Trump Administration announced that it will continue to administer the law until a formal decision is made by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court recently announced that it will hear a challenge in Texas v. United States, though arguments have not yet been set. It is likely that the case will be scheduled for arguments early in the next term that starts in October 2020. Apart from Texas v. United States, ACA litigation continues across the country in district and appellate courts, and before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will issue at least two ACA-related decisions before the end of its current term: one on the risk corridors program (Maine Community Health Options v. United States) and the other on religious or moral exemptions to the contraceptive mandate (Trump v. Pennsylvania and Little Sisters of the Poor v. Pennsylvania). Both decisions are expected before July 2020. It is unclear how the eventual decisions from the Supreme Court and the various other courts across the country to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. It is also unclear how regulations and sub-regulatory policy, which fluctuate continually, may affect interpretation and implementation of the ACA and its practical effects on our business, particularly entering an election year.
 
In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we will be able to charge for our product candidates, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls or access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, measures to reduce costs of the Medicaid program, and some states are considering implementing measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.

These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 
Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA approval under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 
Foreign Regulation of Drugs
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we will need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
