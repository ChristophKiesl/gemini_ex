Item 1.                  Description of Business.
 
The use of the words “CVD,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to CVD Equipment Corporation, a New York corporation incorporated on October 13, 1982, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CVD Materials Corporation (including its wholly owned subsidiaries CVD Tantaline ApS, and CVD MesoScribe Technologies Corporation) collectively “CVD Materials”), FAE Holdings 411519R LLC and 555 N Research Corporation except where the context otherwise requires.
 
We develop, design, manufacture and service a broad range of chemical vapor deposition, gas control and other state-of-the-art process equipment and solutions used in research & development and production of advanced materials and coatings. Our served markets extend from research to industrial applications. This equipment is used by our customers to research, design, and manufacture these materials or coatings for aerospace engine and structural components, medical devices such as implants, advanced semiconductor devices, solar cells, smart glass, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, LEDs, MEMS and other applications. Through CVD Materials and our Application Laboratory, we develop new material systems, provide material coating services, process development support and process startup assistance with the focus on enabling tomorrow’s technologiesTM.
 
   
  


Based on more than 39 years of experience, we use our capabilities in process development, engineering and manufacturing to transform new applications into leading-edge manufacturing solutions. This enables university, research and industrial scientists at the cutting edge of technology to develop next generation aerospace, medical, nano, LEDs, semiconductors and other electronic components. We develop, manufacture and provide equipment for research and production based on our proprietary designs. We have built a significant library of design expertise, know-how and innovative solutions to assist our customers in developing these intricate processes and to accelerate their commercialization. This library of equipment design solutions, along with our manufacturing and systems integration facilities, allows us to provide superior design, process and manufacturing solutions to our customers.
 
Our strategy is to target opportunities in the research, development and production equipment market, with a focus on high growth applications such as aerospace, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, medical, graphene, MEMS and LEDs. To expand our penetration into these growth markets, we have developed a line of proprietary standard products and custom systems. Historically, we manufactured products for research and development on an applications specific basis to meet an individual customer’s specific research requirements. Our proprietary systems leverage the technological expertise that we have developed through designing these custom systems onto a standardized basic core. This core is easily adapted through a broad array of available options to meet the diverse product and budgetary requirements of the research community. By manufacturing the basic core of these systems in higher volumes, we are able to reduce both the cost and delivery time for our systems. These systems, which we market and sell under the EasyTube® and CVD product lines, are sold to researchers at universities, research laboratories, and startup companies in the United States and throughout the world.
 
Sales of our proprietary standard systems, custom systems and process solutions have been driven by our installed customer base, which includes Fortune 500 companies. The strong performance and success of our products has historically driven repeat orders from existing customers as well as business from new customers. Furthermore, with our proprietary solutions and expanded focus on “accelerating the commercialization of tomorrow’s technologies”TM we have been developing a new customer base in addition to growing with our existing customers. We have generally gained new customers through our reputation in the markets and industries, limited print advertising and trade show attendance (which has been negatively impacted by COVID-19).
 
The core competencies we have developed in equipment and software design, as well as in systems manufacturing and process solutions, are used to engineer our finished products and to accelerate the commercialization path of our customer base. Our proprietary-real-time, software allows for rapid configuration, and provides our customers with powerful tools to understand, optimize and repeatedly control their processes. These factors significantly reduce cost, improve quality and reduce the time it takes from customer order to shipment of our products. Our Application Laboratory allows customers the option to bring up their process tools in our Application Laboratory and to work together with our scientists and engineers to optimize process performance.

Current Developments
 
Historically, we have derived substantially all of our revenues through our custom equipment business and our Stainless Design Concepts (“SDC”) gas management and chemical delivery control systems segment.  The marketing, sale and manufacture of our products, requires a lengthy sales cycle ranging from several months to over more than one year before we can complete production and delivery. Also, demand for our equipment and related consumable products and services may be volatile as a result of sudden changes in market conditions, competition and other factors. This can and has resulted in substantial volatility in our revenue stream. 
 
In order to address this sales volatility, we have attempted to diversify and expand our business into providing material products and services. This strategy included the development of our capabilities to provide materials coatings and surface treatments for targeted customer / market requirements (the “Material Business”). With this objective in mind, we acquired Tantaline in December 2016 and MesoScribe in October 2017. In order to facilitate these new lines of businesses, we also purchased a building to house both operating subsidiaries for $13,850,000. This 180,000 square foot building (the “555 Building”) was to house the Material Business in the United States and provide adequate space for the anticipated growth of these businesses. In addition, we also maintain a 130,000 square foot building (the “355 Building”), which houses the equipment products portion of our business as well as our corporate headquarters.
 
We have invested approximately $1.6 million, $2.7 million and $2.5 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in building improvements, machinery, and other expenses related primarily to the Materials Business. 
 
The projected growth of the Materials Business has not met expectations. Although we have made substantial investments in facilities, equipment and acquisitions in furtherance of our strategy, the foregoing has proven to be a significant drain on our finances and our liquidity. Since 2018 revenues for the Materials Business have been $1,700,000 in 2018, $1,600,000 in 2019 and $2,300,000 in 2020, with operating losses, exclusive of a $3.6 million impairment charge, recorded in all years for a total loss of $2.5 million. These cumulative results are due to operating losses from the Tantaline operations offset by operating profits of $.5 million from the MesoScribe operations.
 
Our mortgage debt on the 355 Building and 555 Building, in the amount of $2.1 million and $9.3 million respectively, at December 31 2020, matures in March and December 2022, respectively.
 
In January 2021, our Board of Directors concluded that we needed a change in direction and new leadership to evaluate our business strategy and operations, and take timely actions to halt and reverse the declines of the past few years. As such, they appointed Emmanuel Lakios as President and Chief Executive Officer (previously our Vice-President- Sales and Marketing). We began an intensive analysis of our entire business and operations including the Materials Business. Based upon that analysis we believe our primary focus should be on the core equipment business and that the Materials Business strategy should be revised, with some of its current elements potentially minimized or ceased.  Based upon this analysis, we are forecasting continued losses and negative cash flow for our Tantaline product line and as a consequence, we have implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line, which will result in the avoidance of approximately $1.5-$2.0 million in additional costs. In addition, we have recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. Based upon certain decisions and actions currently being reviewed, there may be additional costs to be incurred, inclusive of employee related and lease termination costs estimated at approximately $400,000.

In order to increase our liquidity and to provide necessary working capital to support our on-going business and operations, we have decided to sell the 555 Building in February 2021. We have determined the 555 Building is not needed for present and future business operations. We have concluded that any remaining elements of the Materials Business can be consolidated into the 355 Building, which we believe can accommodate any needs for our growth for the foreseeable future.
 
On March 29, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Steel K, LLC for the sale of its 555 Building. The purchase price is $24,360,000, and the closing of the sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions to closing or contingencies. A portion of the sale proceeds would be used to satisfy the existing mortgage debt on the 555 Building in the approximate amount of $9.3 million at December 31, 2020, and for various costs related to the sale closing in an amount to be determined. Any excess proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes. 
 
Business Developments
 
CVD Materials Segment: 
 
On October 31, 2017, through our newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, CVD MesoScribe Technologies Corporation (“CVD MesoScribe Technologies”), we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and business of MesoScribe Technologies, Inc. (“MTI”). Formed in 2002, by a group from Stony Brook University, MTI established itself as a pioneer and leader in the direct deposition of thermal sensors, heaters, and instrumentation for harsh environments.
 
MTI specialized in materials processing using Direct Write MesoPlasma™ printing technology. This technology is an enabling additive manufacturing process whereby materials are printed onto conformal components in precise patterns. MTI has provided MesoPlasma™ printing services and products to its customers for use in aerospace, power generation, satellite, and defense markets, focusing on developing and manufacturing innovative products for advanced sensing, heating, and communication.
 
This acquisition provided CVD access to an additional materials deposition technology, a presence in new markets including a broader presence in the aerospace and defense markets, and additional end user applications. In addition, the proprietary MesoPlasma™ technology complimented our Tantaline® business which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2016. The two technologies when combined provide a treatment and coating which can provide both corrosion and wear resistance. This was consistent with our strategic plan to leverage our equipment know-how, business infrastructure and proven ability to scale up new technologies, all offering high value-added materials, products, and services and was another step in our combined organic and acquisition growth strategy.
 
In 2017, to support the expected growth of CVD Materials and to relocate the California MesoScribe operations as well as Tantaline USA business on November 30, 2017, we purchased the premises located at 555 North Research Place, Central Islip, NY (the “Premises”). The purchase price of the Premises was $13,850,000, exclusive of closing costs. On November 30, 2017, the Company’s newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, 555 N Research Corporation (the “Assignee”) and the Islip IDA, entered into a Fee and Leasehold Mortgage and Security Agreement (the “Loan”) with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (the “Bank”) in the amount of $10,387,500, which was used to finance a portion of the purchase price to acquire the Premises. The Loan was evidenced by the certain Note, dated November 30, 2017 (the “Note”), by and between Assignee and the Bank, and secured by a certain Fee and Leasehold Mortgage and Security Agreement, dated November 30, 2017 (the “Mortgage”), as well as a collateral Assignment of Leases and Rents (“Assignment of Leases”).
 
   5

  

The Loan is payable in sixty consecutive equal monthly installments of $62,481, including interest. The Loan bears interest for each Interest Period (as defined in the Note), at the fixed rate of 3.9148%. The maturity date for the Note is December 1, 2022.
 
As a condition of the Bank making the Loan, the Company was required to guaranty Assignee’s obligations under the Loan pursuant to that certain Unlimited Guaranty, dated November 30, 2017 (the “Guaranty”).
 
Our new management evaluated our business projections, the utilization of our facilities and ability to raise capital to maintain and ultimately grow our operations, which as a result, has caused us to initiate the consolidation of the 555 Building into the 355 Building operations, and to sell the 555 Building.
 
In January 2021, our Board of Directors concluded that we needed a change in direction and new leadership to evaluate our business strategy and operations, and take timely actions to halt and reverse the declines of the past few years. As such, they appointed Emmanuel Lakios as President and Chief Executive Officer (previously our Vice-President- Sales and Marketing). We began an intensive analysis of our entire business and operations including the Materials Business. Based upon that analysis we believe our primary focus should be on the core equipment business and that the Materials Business strategy should be revised, with some of its current elements potentially minimized or ceased.  Based upon this analysis, we are forecasting continued losses and negative cash flow for our Tantaline product line and as a consequence, we have implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line, which will result in the avoidance of approximately $1.5-$2.0 million in additional costs. In addition, we have recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. Based upon certain decisions and actions currently being reviewed, there may be additional costs to be incurred, inclusive of employee related and lease termination costs estimated at approximately $400,000.
 
With the pending completion of the consolidation of facilities, we believe we have adequate manufacturing space to accommodate our capabilities of providing materials, coatings and surface treatments to meet our customers’ needs as well as improved capital utilization and facilities cost absorption. We continue to be positioned for the expansion of our carbon composites and electronic materials, MesoScribe Technologies and other product lines.

We invested approximately $1.6 million, $2.7 million and $2.5 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in building improvements, machinery, and other expenses related primarily to the operations of CVD Materials. The start up of MesoScribe™ operations have been completed and it was fully operational during 2020, since the move of its operations in the middle of 2019 from California. Since September 2019, MesoScribe™ has secured orders and contracts in excess of $2.0 million, and in early 2020 we have hired four employees including test and project management to support those orders and growth opportunities. Tantaline® US equipment and facilitation continued to be installed in 2020 and was in various stages of process testing, qualification and refinement at the end of the year.
 
With regard to Tantaline® our Demark facility provides both local and global deposition services, although the majority of the business has been in Europe. The 555 Building was contemplated to primarily support the US customer base as well as serve as our application and technology center.
 
With respect to our CVD MesoScribe Technologies subsidiary, we have completed the process of consolidating the manufacturing and development operations in Central Islip in 2019. This has resulted in a reduction of our operating expenses associated with no longer leasing space in California and has provided synergies with the Central Islip sales and marketing functions and place the operations near the local Thermal Spray Center of Excellence located at Stony Brook University.

Tantaline® treatment is a diffusion bonded protective layer of tantalum formed by chemical vapor deposition on the surface of common materials. Tantalum is the most corrosion resistant metal commercially available. This surface layer provides protection against many of the most aggressive environments, including high temperature concentrated acid. Global sales and technical support is provided by our facility in Central Islip, New York with production provided from our European facility located in Nordborg, Denmark. Tantaline®. We continue to develop new Tantalum processes to improve the corrosion resistance of additional base material such as Nickel based alloys. In 2018, we announced that two patent applications were filed. With the recent change in new leadership in January 2021, we began an intensive analysis of our entire business and operations including the Materials Business. Based upon that analysis we believe our primary focus should be on the core equipment business and that the Materials Business strategy should be revised, with some of its current elements potentially minimized or ceased.  Based upon this analysis, we are forecasting continued losses and negative cash flow for our Tantaline product line and as a consequence, we have implemented plans to eliminate further investment in our Tantaline product line, which will result in the avoidance of approximately $1.5-$2.0 million in additional costs. In addition, we have recorded an impairment charge of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020. Based upon certain decisions and actions currently being reviewed, there may be additional costs to be incurred, inclusive of employee related and lease termination costs estimated at approximately $400,000.
 
MesoScribe Technologies provides MesoPlasma™ printing services and products (heaters, antennas, and sensors) to aerospace, satellite, power generation, defense, and other markets requiring high performance. MesoScribe Technologies operated from a 22,000 square foot facility located in Huntington Beach, CA, until May 2019. The relocation of MesoSccribe’s operations to Central Islip, New York was completed during the third quarter of 2019. The consolidation of our Materials Business into the 355 Building is underway and estimated to be completed mid-year 2021.
 
Carbon Composites 
 Our developments and opportunities for the Carbon composite business come from achievements in our applications laboratory. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced the development of a family of advanced Fluid Reactors based on our innovations in nanotechnology and chemical vapor deposition technology. The Fluid Reactor is enabled by a novel reactor core element which allows the efficient transfer of gases into and out of liquids. The market adoption of this technology could supplant existing hollow fiber membrane technology for applications including filtration and liquid gasification or degasification. One such application being investigated is blood oxygenation cartridges, known as Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenators, which are typically used during cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and are essential for life support. CVD has a patent pending embodying this technology. While holding promise the technology is in the evaluation phase and is not expected to generate revenue in the near future. We continue to investigate other application end uses for the liquid-gas and liquid-liquid exchange technology. As to this time there is not a near term revenue stream projected.
 
The applications lab, along with the sales and marketing team are exploring other possible carbon based products and applications that can be made from this carbon nano tube, infiltrated carbon and carbon nano fiber technology.

Principal Equipment Products
 
Chemical Vapor Deposition/Infiltration - A process which passes a gaseous compound over or through pores of a substrate material surface that is heated to such a degree that the compound decomposes and deposits a desired layer onto and or into a substrate material. The process is accomplished by combining appropriate gases in a reaction chamber, of the kind produced by the Company, at elevated temperatures (typically 150-1,600° Celsius). Our chemical vapor deposition systems are complete and include all necessary instrumentation, subsystems and components and include state-of-the-art process control software. We provide both standard and application specified engineered products. Some of the standard systems we offer are for silicon, silicon-germanium, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, polysilicon, liquid phase epitaxial, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon nanowires, solar cell research and solar material quality control.

Principal Materials Products
 
Quartz-ware - All process equipment, especially systems in production/manufacturing environments, require routine maintenance, consumable and spare parts. One such spare part and consumable which is core to our technology offering is quartz hardware. We provide standard and custom fabricated quartz-ware used in our equipment and to a lesser extent for other customer tools. We also provide repair and replacement of existing quartz-ware. The business volume is favorably impacted by our CVD/First Nano systems being in production/manufacturing environments.
 
MesoPlasma™ Direct Write Printing: A materials deposition process that provides robust high definition instrumentation, fine feature patterns, and coatings onto conformal components. Powder materials are injected into a thermal plasma where they are rapidly heated and deposited onto the substrate or component. A 6-axis robotic system ensures pattern placement accuracy and manufacturing consistency. The versatility of the process enables a wide range of materials to be deposited including ceramic dielectrics, nickel-based sensor alloys, metallic conductors, precious metals, and protective coatings. Products include temperature sensors, heaters, antennas and patterns per customer specifications.
 
Tantaline® Corrosion Resistant Coating: Tantaline® treatment is provided as part of either a finished product or as a service applied to customer sourced components. These include valves, fittings, fasteners, vessels, bellows, and a wide range of custom designed items. The Tantaline® treatment drastically improves the corrosion resistance of these base stainless-steel parts extending the service life and increasing value in a wide range of applications.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
We serve multiple emerging and mature global markets including aerospace, defense, biomedical implants, microelectronic and micromechanical devices, semiconductor, universities and research centers. Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we believe it is essential to contact customers directly through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors specializing in the type of equipment, products and services that we sell. In addition to our traditional customer base, we are now accessing new markets and new customers through MesoScribe,® and other components of our materials business. Our primary marketing activities include direct sales contacts, participation in trade shows (which were significantly impacted in 2020 by COVID-19) and our internet websites www.cvdequipment.com, cvdmaterialscorporation.com, www.stainlessdesign.com, www.firstnano.com, tantaline.com and www.MesoScribe.com.
Customers
 
We continue to work on expanding our product and service offerings. Our systems and products are used in research and in production applications. We market and sell primarily to aerospace/defense, electronic component manufacturers, institutions involved in electronic component research (such as universities, government and industrial laboratories) and to industries such as medical that require specialized coatings. We have both a domestic and international customer base with hundreds of installed systems.
 
   10

  

Given the complexity of some of the systems we sell, revenue from a single customer in any one year can exceed 10.0% of our total sales. Two customers represented 30.5% in total and two customers represented 39.3%, respectively, of our annual revenues in fiscal years 2020 and 2019. We believe that our relationships with these customers are positive and may provide us with ongoing continuous sustainability for years to come, however the loss of a large customer would have to be replaced by others, and our inability to do so has had a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately $2.8 million or 16.8% of our revenues were generated by sales to customers outside the U.S., compared to approximately $4.2 million or 21.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 
Warranties
 
Warranties on our equipment are typically for twelve months but can range up to twenty-four months from shipment with extended contracts. We furnish any warranties from original manufacturers of components used in our products. We provide service and support for our installed base of equipment with in-house field service personnel. Warranty costs, including those incurred in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, are and have been historically insignificant and expensed as incurred.
Competition
 
We can experience intense direct competition from both domestic and international competitors in all of our equipment segments. Our First Nano product line, targeted at universities and introductory sites, faces price pressure from lower value-added competitors. Our MesoScribe operations, which is in the adoption phase, faces barriers from established indirect competitors of existing solution providers. We are aware of other competitors that offer a substantial number of products and services comparable to ours. Many of our competitors (including customers who may elect to manufacture systems for internal use) have financial, marketing and other resources greater than ours. To date, we believe that each of our product and service segments has been able to compete favorably in markets that include these competitors, primarily on the basis of know-how, technical performance, quality, delivery, price and aftermarket support. We will continue to focus on products which serve both markets that are growing and where we have a technical and commercial competitive advantage.
 
CVD/First Nano competes with companies located in Asia, Europe and the US in the research market. These companies have limited support and safety and system design capabilities. For the academia market, we also compete with laboratory built systems. Our equipment for production applications competes with in-house design and engineering capability and the capacity to build their own equipment internally. Additionally, there are large, established companies who compete with us and pose a competitive risk in the market. Due to budgetary and funding constraints, many customers are price sensitive. We believe that our systems are among the most advanced available for the targeted market, and coupled with our vertical integration in engineering and manufacturing, we can be very competitive.
 
   11

  

SDC’s gas management and chemical delivery control systems are among the most advanced available. We further believe that SDC is differentiated from our competitors through our intimate understanding of how the systems in which our products are incorporated are actually used in field applications. We have gained this understanding as a result of having designed and built complex process gas systems for CVD/First Nano as well as for a number of the world’s leading semiconductor, aerospace, medical, solar manufacturers, research laboratories and universities.
 
Sources of Supply
 
Many of the components used in producing our products are purchased from unrelated suppliers. We have OEM status with our suppliers but we are not obligated to purchase a pre-determined quantity. We are not dependent on a principal or major supplier and alternate suppliers are available. Subject to lead times, the components and raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are readily obtainable.
 
Currently we maintain a fully-equipped machine shop that we use to fabricate a significant portion of our metal components in-house, including the most complex designed parts of our equipment. Similarly, our quartz fabrication capability is sufficient to meet our quartz-ware needs.
 
Materials procured from the outside and/or manufactured internally undergo a rigorous quality control process to ensure that the parts meet or exceed our requirements and those of our customers. Upon final assembly, all equipment undergoes a final series of complete testing to ensure maximum product performance.
 
Backlog 
 
As of December 31, 2020, our order backlog was approximately $5.7 million, compared to $8.9 million as of December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.2 million. Contributing to and compounding this decline, is the negative effect the COVID-19 crisis has had in 2020 on the aerospace industry, which resulted from reduced travel and reduction of industry gas turbine engine sales. Aerospace sales have represented as much as 60% of our total revenue. We continue to work at diversifying our customer base away from any one customer as we focus on new opportunities with new and existing customers within our existing marketplaces and in new applications, including the start-up of the CVD Materials operations. The timing for completion of backlog varies depending on the product mix and can be as long as two years or as short as 30-60 days. Order backlog is usually a reasonable management tool to indicate expected revenues, however, it does not provide an assurance of future achievement or profits as order cancellations or delays are possible.
Intellectual Property 
 
Our success is dependent, in part upon our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have historically protected our proprietary information and intellectual property such as design specifications, blueprints, technical processes and employee know-how through the use of non-disclosure agreements.  In addition, where we deem appropriate, we have, and will continue to file for patent protection of our proprietary technology that we believe has the potential to be incorporated into our products and sold to multiple customers.  We also maintain and/or assert rights in certain trademarks relating to certain of our products and product lines, and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced the development of a family of advanced Fluid Reactors based on our innovations in nanotechnology and chemical vapor deposition technology. The Fluid Reactor is enabled by a novel reactor core element which allows the efficient transfer of gases into and out of liquids. The market adoption of this technology could supplant existing hollow fiber membrane technology for applications including filtration and liquid gasification or degasification. One such application is blood oxygenation cartridges, known as Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenators, which are typically used during cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery and are essential for life support. CVD has a patent pending embodying this technology. CVD is continuing development of its Fluid Reactor technology and during 2019 filed two related US Provisional Patent Applications.
 
While patent, copyright and trademark protections for our intellectual property are important to different degrees for our various products and solutions, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel and our ability to accelerate the commercialization of next generation intellectual properties. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and other security measures.
 

Research and Development
 
The university research community is at the forefront of nanotechnology research, and we are focused on providing state-of-the-art systems to this market that will help bridge the gap between pioneering research and marketable products. Our Application Laboratory, together with a number of leading universities and startup companies with whom we partner from time to time, conducts cutting-edge research on the growth and infiltration of carbon nanotubes, graphene and nanowires as well as on selected aerospace manufacturing processes. The results of this research could have far reaching implications concerning the use and manufacture of carbon nanotubes, graphene, nanowires and aerospace coatings for many markets. Our intention is that together with leading edge universities and start-up companies and major aerospace/defense companies, we will leverage our collective expertise in this field, which will allow us to capitalize on commercial opportunities in the future.
 
In 2020, we incurred approximately $373,000 in research and development expenses as compared to $598,000 in 2019.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local government regulations, such as environmental, labor and export control. We believe that we have obtained all necessary permits to operate our business and that we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us. These regulations change on an ongoing basis and the effect of the changes could materially impact our business in certain technology areas and regions.

Insurance
 
Our products are used in our customers’ manufacturing processes which in some cases contain explosive, flammable, corrosive and toxic gases. There are potential exposures to personal injury as well as property damage, particularly if operated without regard to the design limits of the systems and components. Additionally, the end products of some of our customers are used in areas such as aerospace and high-tech devices where safety is of great concern. Management reviews its insurance coverage on an annual basis or more frequently if appropriate and we believe we have the types and amounts of insurance coverage that are sufficient for our business.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2020, we had 130 employees. We had 62 employees in manufacturing, 28 in engineering (including research and development and efforts related to product improvement) 4 in field service, 9 in sales and marketing and 27 in general management, maintenance and administration, compared to 172 employees as of December 31, 2019. None of our employees were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We generally consider our employee relations to be good.
 
The implementation of our business strategy largely depends on our ability to hire, train, and retain qualified and diverse professionals, and we must emphasize employee development and training in order to do so. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of managers and intend to establish a strong succession planning program for our critical positions, including internships for technical and engineering resources from local universities. Moreover, a key strategic focus of our new management team is to foster and maintain a strong and healthy culture, where collaboration to achieve results and focus on the success of our customers and shareholders is paramount.
 

Employee Compensation
 
In addition, our new management is undertaking a review of our compensation programs to better align the compensation of our employees with our performance, and to provide the proper short-term and long-term incentives to attract, retain and motivate them to achieve superior results. We believe we must offer wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience and knowledge, and in order to do so we may work with a nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firm to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive and non-executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within our industry.

Employee Safety
 
The health and safety of our employees and partners is our highest priority, and this is consistent with our operating philosophy. We maintain strong environmental, health and safety protocols that focus on implementing policies and training programs, as well as performing self audits to ensure our colleagues and partners leave the workplace safely on a daily basis. Our safety focus is also evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which included:

● | adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------


● | adjusting attendance policy is to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increase in cleaning protocols;

● | providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requiring masks to be worn at all locations, where allowed or required by local law;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
