Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation (AGTC) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that uses a proprietary gene therapy platform to develop transformational genetic therapies for patients suffering from rare and debilitating diseases. Our initial focus is in the field of ophthalmology, where we continue to progress clinical programs in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and achromatopsia (ACHM). In addition, we have an additional partnered clinical-stage program in optogenetics, and pre-clinical programs in central nervous system (CNS), and several other ophthalmology, and otology indications. With several important clinical milestones on the horizon, we believe that we are well positioned to advance multiple programs towards pivotal studies as data develops to support their advancement. In addition to our product pipeline, we have also developed broad technological capabilities in the design, construction and manufacture of viral vectors using adeno-associated virus (AAV) technology. Finally, we have augmented these capabilities through multiple academic and commercial collaborations which provide us with additional expertise. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to become a leader in developing and commercializing gene therapy treatments for patients with severe diseases, with an initial focus in ophthalmology, and thereby provide a better life for patients with these diseases. Our strategy to accomplish this goal is to: 

 | Develop and commercialize gene therapies in orphan ophthalmology. Our lead product candidates are treatments for the severe orphan eye diseases XLRP and ACHM. Given the severity of these diseases and the current lack of treatment options, a one-time-treatment alternative that corrects the underlying genetic defect would provide long-term value for patients, their families and the healthcare system more broadly.

 | Expand our position in ophthalmology.
--+--------------------------------------


 | Continue our leadership position in orphan ophthalmology. We have developed significant experience in the orphan ophthalmology space through our ongoing work on XLRP and ACHM, our previous experience in X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) and Lebers Congenital Amaurosis Type 2 (LCA2) and in our preclinical ophthalmology programs. We are applying this knowledge to additional pre-clinical programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage capabilities into larger ocular market opportunities: the insight and understanding gained in connection with our inherited retinal disease programs enhance the capabilities to apply our technology to larger ophthalmology indications such as our pre-clinical program in dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Seek opportunities for strategic partnerships and acquisitions in ophthalmology gene therapy. In February 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bionic Sight, LLC, or Bionic Sight, to develop an optogenetic product candidate for patients with advanced retinal disease that leverages our deep experience in gene therapy and ophthalmology and Bionic Sights innovative neuro-prosthetic device and algorithm for retinal coding. We believe there may be additional opportunities for us to partner with companies and academic groups in ophthalmology and more generally. We expect that our breadth of experience in research, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory matters will help us to identify and execute in-licenses, co-development agreements, intellectual property acquisitions or manufacturing agreements that could further extend our leadership position in ophthalmology gene therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Extend our expertise in adeno-associated virus, or AAV, vector design, manufacturing and delivery. We believe that our deep understanding of our target indications and our robust internal expertise in viral vector design gives us a significant competitive advantage. This understanding includes the identification of novel capsids and the optimization of genes and promoters, physical vector delivery, vector manufacturing, clinical trial design and clinical trial conduct. We intend to continue to devote substantial resources both internally and with external research collaborations to identify novel next generation capsids, develop optimized promoters to enhance product performance, and identify opportunities for continuous improvement in our manufacturing process. We are also expanding our research and discovery capabilities to further enhance our ability to develop next generation products, including the delivery of other payloads such as antibodies and RNA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand our manufacturing capabilities. We continue to invest in the development and expansion of our internal manufacturing capabilities with a particular focus on enhancing the productivity, scalability, and purity of our manufacturing platform. Our late stage commercial manufacturing process has demonstrated it can produce thousands of ophthalmology doses from a 50L bioreactor with an approximately 90% full to empty capsid ratio and greater than 97% purity levels as demonstrated in multiple batches completed by our personnel and two batches completed at a CDMO. We have a fully functional process development and pilot manufacturing facility used to manufacture early stage research materials, and as we advance further into clinical development, we plan to further develop our internal manufacturing capabilities. We have decreased our dependence on a single contract manufacturer by qualifying and contracting with multiple backup contractors. Further, we continue to invest in process and analytical improvements that have resulted in a ten-fold increase in manufacturing yields potentially resulting in up to a 90% reduction in cost of goods compared to other approaches as well as robust quality control enhancements that are amenable to characterization of commercial products. We believe that these investments will facilitate the more rapid advancement of our product candidates through regulatory approval while reducing risk and will enhance the therapeutic and commercial potential of our gene therapy platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Pursue indications outside of ophthalmology with high unmet medical need and strong probability of a streamlined clinical, regulatory and commercial pathway. We will continue to use a consistent framework to focus on diseases for which:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the underlying genetic defect is well characterized,
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | the underlying genetic defect can be addressed by approaches amenable with the use of AAV, such as gene replacement, RNA targeting sequences, or antibody delivery, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | predictive animal models exist and for which clinical endpoints are objective and accepted by regulatory authorities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that focusing on these types of indications will enable us to obtain data more rapidly and accelerate clinical studies and regulatory approval of our product candidates. Given the relatively low prevalence of patients who have these orphan diseases and the strong key opinion leader communities and patient advocacy groups that support them, we also believe that these markets can be served with a small, targeted commercial infrastructure. Our research in the fields of otology and CNS are examples of this strategy. 
 Our Initial Focus in Ophthalmology 
 Sight is critical to the human experience. Many people fear blindness more than premature death. Consequently, we have initially decided to focus our expertise in gene therapy on orphan diseases in ophthalmology. These orphan indications have patient populations that are small enough to allow for clinical trials on a manageable scale but have a sufficient prevalence to provide substantial commercial opportunity. By focusing initially on orphan ophthalmology product candidates, we are also able to leverage our experience and develop strong relationships within the relevant scientific and medical communities. Our clinical trials are conducted mainly at academic test centers and by working with the principal investigators and surgeons at these test centers, we have realized a number of important synergies. 
 Our most advanced product candidates consist of three ophthalmology development programs across two targets: XLRP caused by mutations in the RPGR gene, and ACHM, caused by mutations in either the CNGB3 gene or the CNGA3 gene. These inherited orphan diseases of the eye are caused by mutations in single genes that significantly affect visual function and currently lack effective medical treatments. 
 

 | XLRP is a disease of the rod and cone photoreceptors characterized by progressive degeneration of the retina, which can lead to total blindness in adult men. According to a published study, the incidence rate for retinitis pigmentosa is about one in 4,000 people and we estimate that there are about 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe combined. It is estimated that about ten percent, or 20,000, of these people have XLRP. We have completed targeted enrollment of 28 patients in our Phase 1/2 clinical trials for our XLRP product candidate and are currently planning our next phase of clinical trial activities, which is informed by end-of phase 2 feedback received from the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ACHM is characterized by the absence of cone photoreceptor function, resulting in extremely poor visual acuity, extreme light sensitivity, day blindness and complete loss of color discrimination. According to a published study, the incidence rate for ACHM is approximately one in 30,000 people, and we therefore estimate that there are about 27,000 patients in the United States and Europe combined. Of these patients, about 75% to 85% have the form of disease caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene or the CNGA3 gene. We have completed planned enrollment of adult patients in our Phase 1/2 clinical trials for both our ACHM CNGB3 product candidate and our ACHM CNGA3 product candidate and continue to enroll pediatric patients in the higher dose groups.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to these two lead ophthalmology programs, we have an additional clinical program in collaboration with Bionic Sight to develop an optogenetic product candidate for patients with advanced retinal disease.

successfully demonstrated in seven different clinical trials, and has demonstrated a 10-fold increase in productivity as a result of our internal development efforts, which means that we can produce thousands of ophthalmology doses from a 50L bioreactor with greater than 90% full capsids and 97% purity at a cost of goods that is potentially as much as a 90-fold improvement over other methods;

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Capabilities in clinical operations and medical affairs to power our multiple clinical programs forward.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Gene Therapy Platform 
 Although the concept of gene therapy is relatively straightforward, the process of developing and manufacturing vectors capable of delivering genetic material safely into a patients own cells is highly technical and demands significant expertise, experience and know-how. Our approach to gene therapy product development is built on our core competencies in four key areas: vector selection, design, manufacturing and delivery, each of which is described in further detail below. One of our key capabilities is our depth of understanding of the complex interplay between the clinical disease, the cells in the patients body that need treatment, the selection of a capsid and a promoter, the design of the gene construct and the physical administration method. We have spent more than 19 years conducting research on the best combinations of these elements with the aim of developing safe and effective product candidates. 
Vector Selection 
 The success of a gene therapy platform is highly dependent on the vector selected. Our platform is based on the use of a non-replicating AAV to deliver the correct DNA directly to the nucleus of the cells affected by the disease. As an underlying platform, we believe that AAV vectors are particularly well suited for treating our target diseases and have advantages over other viral vectors, such as adenovirus, herpes virus and lentivirus. These advantages include: 

 | AAV is a small, simple non-enveloped virus with only two native genes, which makes the virus easy to engineer as an effective vector;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AAV is inherently stable and resistant to degradation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | AAV vectors can deliver functional genes in a manner that supports long-term production of protein, leading to sustained therapeutic effect, without altering the patients native DNA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AAV vectors have a demonstrated safety profile across multiple human clinical trials in several indications; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AAV vectors are versatile, having the ability to carry therapeutic gene sequences of up to 4,000 base pairs in length into a patients cell. As more than 90% of human genes have coding sequences less than 3,000 base pairs in length, this allows AAV vectors to be used in a wide variety of indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vector Design 
 After selection of the vector type, there are other critical factors to be considered to maximize the safety and efficacy of the final gene therapy product: 

 | Gene of Interest: The first step in vector design is to identify either the therapeutic protein that we want the patients own cells to produce (which is expressed from a DNA sequence that defines the gene of interest), or other cargo content, such as gene editing components or an RNA targeting sequence. In many cases the DNA sequence must be engineered to be stable during manufacturing and delivery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 


 
 | Promoter: Production of the protein in the cell requires a promoter, which is a genetic element that drives expression. Certain promoters function well only in certain cell types, whereas other promoters function well in almost any cell type. We make our selection by comparing different promoters in the specific type of cells that are affected in each disease target, ideally in an animal whose physiology is close to that of humans, to find the promoter that best enables production of therapeutic levels of protein in that cell type. We have on-going internal and external research efforts to design promoters that optimize therapeutic constructs for maximum expression with a smaller size, better expression and increased cell specificity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Capsid: after the promoter and gene of interest are selected, these elements must be packaged into an AAV capsid. There are 108 to 109 variations of AAV capsids with different abilities to bind to and enter varying cell types. Not only do we engineer these capsids in-house, we also collaborate with commercial and academic researchers to develop novel capsids that efficiently enter the type of cells that are affected by each of our targeted diseases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vector Manufacturing 
 We have built an rAAV manufacturing platform agnostic to indication, dosing requirements or market size, with demonstrated ability to generate thousands of ocular doses in modest scale stirred tank bioreactors. This scalable, proprietary, high-yield vector manufacturing process can address the most demanding material needs with minimized scaling needs. The system is turnkey, employing robust cell lines that are well characterized and have been vetted by regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada and Europe. The upstream process is reproducible and generates vectors characterized by greater than 50% of all capsids containing full-length, target gene sequences while the downstream process further enhances this resulting in excess of 90% full capsids. The companion analytical platform for process and material characterization is comprised of over 35 product-specific assays developed and transferred to vendors, consistent with regulatory requirements for clinical development. The full suite of characterization assays has transitioned to validation activities to support regulatory approval of the production and characterization platforms. Large biotech partners have successfully transferred our technology into their facilities, and even transferred the process themselves to third party Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs), demonstrating an unparalleled robustness. We have employed an aggressive risk mitigation approach to manufacturing activities for our internal pipeline, resulting in technology transfer of our platform to multiple redundant CDMOs. Recent process improvements advance our upstream productivity over ten-fold relative to earlier versions of the process (figure below), and over 50-fold relative to traditional transient transfection, employing all scalable operations which have been optimized to provide a final product substantially free of process residuals, often below the quantification limits of our sensitive assays. 
 Our manufacturing process has been reviewed by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, Health Canada, the Irish Medicines Board and the Israeli Ministry of Health and has been authorized for production of clinical trial material for use in clinical trials in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. We have successfully manufactured clinical trial material for seven different indications using three different CDMOs, and believe we are the only AAV gene therapy company with this level of experience. Our staff have utilized our state-of-the-art process development facility to adapt our process across multiple bioreactor platforms and scales, demonstrating a robust and flexible platform capable of integrating into diverse partner, manufacturing and commercial facility environments. 
 We own or have licensed 37 patents and pending patent applications covering our manufacturing technology. We believe that our core competency and intellectual property estate in vector manufacturing provide a key differentiating element of our gene therapy platform. 
 The complexity of gene therapy manufacturing and lack of dedicated infrastructure to support it have historically resulted in poor reproducibility and lack of reliability in meeting material needs beyond the early human clinical setting. rAAV vector manufacturing has been limited by inefficient constructs, poor scalability, inadequate yields

  and insufficient purity. Our focus is to develop an integrated production and testing platform capable of meeting both clinical and commercial needs and we are committing substantial resources in this area. Important features of our capabilities are set forth below. 
 

 | Our propriety platform for AAV production generates high quality rAAV vectors with high packaging fidelity, high infectivity and low empty particles across multiple serotypes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our AAV production system generates high volumetric productivities and has achieved more than 10-fold improvement in productivity compared to other manufacturing formats.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have adapted our herpes simplex virus, or HSV, helper manufacturing system to multiple vendors single use bioreactors, demonstrating robustness and flexibility while removing scale and format limitations attendant with adherent cell culture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have optimized purification and formulation activities to yield multiple rAAV serotypes in a dose-ready form with exceptional purity at previously unattainable genomic concentrations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our integrated testing platform has generated over 35 product-specific characterization assays that have been successfully transferred for the evaluation of HSV helpers and AAV vectors at contract testing organizations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The robust cell substrates we employ are well characterized and have been reviewed in several regulatory submissions in the U.S., Canada, Israel and Europe.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our ability to successfully transfer the technology to multiple contract manufacturing organizations as well as collaboration partners demonstrates the robustness of our manufacturing process.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Taken together, we believe that the efficiency, productivity, scalability, characterization and regulatory definition of our proprietary rAAV manufacturing platform uniquely position us to quickly transition from early phase human clinical trials to late phase, BLA-enabling data in all our clinical programs. We are currently at commercial scale for our orphan ophthalmology programs due to our high productivity that enable us to achieve thousands of doses from a small bioreactor. As such, in the near term, it is more efficient for us to pursue a hybrid strategy where we have developed and optimized the manufacturing process and leverage a CDMOs investment in capital equipment when needed. Productivity (below, left) has increased 55-fold between early clinical and commercial processes at scale, while process residuals (below, right) have decreased nearly 40-fold (DNA) or greater than 10-fold (protein).

 Vector Delivery 
 Our gene therapy platform allows for vector delivery by a variety of methods, and we select the method that is best suited for the disease and cell type that we are targeting. 
 In ophthalmology, the product candidate can best be delivered to cells in the eye by either injecting the product candidate under the retina, a sub-retinal injection or by injecting the product candidate into the vitreous of the eye, an intravitreal injection. We are using sub-retinal injection as the method of delivery for our XLRP and ACHM product candidates in our ongoing clinical trials and have developed an extensive training program for surgeons in order to assure consistent delivery across patients. Bionic Sight is using an intravitreal injection as the method of delivery for the optogenetic product candidate. 
 Established surgical techniques used to introduce AAV in otology indications include microinjection into the cochlea via an apical cochleostomy or through the round window membrane. Like the eye, the inner ear sensory organ  the organ of Corti  is bathed by fluid-filled spaces, enabling accessible vector administration. 
 For each product candidate identified in our CNS pre-clinical programs, we will determine the optimal delivery approach to safely administer the product candidate and ensure optimal therapeutic effect. 
 Our Product Candidate Pipeline 
 Our most advanced product candidates address ophthalmology indications XLRP, ACHM B3, and ACHM A3, which are orphan diseases of the eye that are caused by mutations in single genes, significantly affect visual function starting at birth and currently lack effective medical treatments. Ophthalmology is attractive to us as a clinical stage company because treatments for diseases affecting vision have clearly defined, objective clinical endpoints with validated measurement tools that are accepted by regulatory authorities. Other orphan drug companies have spent considerable time and resources working with regulatory authorities to identify acceptable clinical endpoints and develop measurement tools in rare diseases with limited epidemiology data available. In ophthalmology there are four accepted endpointsvisual acuity, visual fields, contrast sensitivity and color visionthat are well understood by clinicians. In addition, the FDA consistently applies these endpoints and works with industry to provide guidance on how much improvement is required for clinical relevancy. We believe that these endpoints could help accelerate the process of clinical study and regulatory approval for our ophthalmic product candidates. We have also been encouraged by guidance from FDA for rare and inherited retinal disease that we believe signals the agencys willingness to work collaboratively on novel clinical design and novel endpoints that could help advance products to patients more efficiently. 
Our Lead Programs 
 X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP) 
 Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited retinal disease with progressive loss of vision, meaning children are born with defective genes that cause poor visual function that significantly affects daily activities and worsens over time. XLRP is commonly first observed in boys and young men who notice problems with vision under low light conditions, or night blindness, followed by a restriction of peripheral visual fields, or tunnel vision, leading to poor central vision and eventually to total blindness. 
 The incidence rate for retinitis pigmentosa is about one in 4,000 people, according to a published study, and we estimate that there are about 75,000 people in the United States and 125,000 people in Europe with retinitis pigmentosa, or 200,000 people combined. According to a published study, about 10% of cases of retinitis pigmentosa are XLRP, from which we therefore estimate that there are about 20,000 persons with XLRP in the United States and Europe combined.

 Our XLRP product candidate 
 Our gene therapy approach to the treatment of XLRP involves using an AAV vector to insert a functional copy of the RPGR gene into the patients photoreceptor cells. Our XLRP product candidate, AGTC-501, contains an optimized and stabilized RPGR gene and a promoter that have been shown in preclinical studies to drive efficient gene expression in primate rods and cones, as well as maintain photoreceptor function and delay disease progression in dog and mouse models of XLRP. In addition, published non-human primate, or NHP, studies have demonstrated that AGTCs proprietary AAV capsid has as much as twice the transfection efficiency in photoreceptors as is shown by capsids used in competing programs. 
 Clinical development 
 On January 9, 2020, AGTC released interim data from its on-going XLRP Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial, conducted at multiple clinical sites in the U.S. that specialize in inherited retinal diseases. The clinical protocol was designed as a dose escalation trial to evaluate our product candidate in XLRP patients at five dose levels, spanning a 100-fold range, and included targeted enrollment of 28 patients in the dose escalation and expansion portions of the trial. This design is intended to provide us with a robust set of safety and biologic activity data with which to inform our next stage of clinical development. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is safety, and interim data have shown that the XLRP product candidate thus far continues to show a favorable safety profile and is well tolerated. In addition to safety, this trial is measuring biologic activity by assessing changes in several measures of visual function and quality of life. Durable and meaningful improvements in central visual sensitivity and encouraging improvements in visual acuity were reported through Month 6. 
 XLRP Phase 1/2 Trial Design and Dosing Schedule 
 

On January 28, 2020 at our Corporate Research and Development Day, we provided more data from the XLRP Phase 1/2 trial to include topline six-month data in 10 patients from the dose escalation Groups 1 through 3, as well as six-month data from 7 patients in the dose expansion Group 4. This data showed a favorable safety profile for all patients and stability of visual function in peripherally dosed patients. The presentation then focused on the nine centrally dosed patients, of which 4 of 8 evaluable patients showed an improvement of visual sensitivity relative to baseline, and 7 of 9 showed positive trend towards improvement in BCVA. Additionally, to date, none of the patients now enrolled in our trial have needed re-administration of steroids to treat secondary inflammation as reported in other XLRP trials. Summaries of the mean sensitivity and BCVA data are provided below.

In addition to presenting the summary data for mean sensitivity, the company also reviewed individual heatmaps of all patients, which showed that in many cases, not only did patients experience an increase in mean sensitivity, but also, as illustrated below, the area of the retina responding to light expanded, which is an important component to the patients quality of life.

 On February 19, 2020, AGTC announced that it had met its enrollment target, including dosing of patients in the two highest dose groups, in its Phase 1/2 clinical trial for its XLRP product candidate. 
 On July 22, 2020, based on comprehensive written feedback received from the FDA on its End-of-Phase 2 submission, AGTC announced its updated clinical development plan for the XLRP product candidate, which includes immediate randomized, masked expansion of the current Phase 1/2 trial, and a planned start of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial during the first quarter of calendar year 2021. 
 The Company received FDA feedback across three major areas: CMC, pre-clinical and clinical. 
 Based on feedback on the CMC section, the Company is adjusting the timing of its clinical trial material comparability study to complete this important analysis prior to the initiation of our Phase 2/3 trial. This study will compare the clinical trial material produced under the new manufacturing process to material used in the Phase 1/2 trial. In the Phase 2/3 trial, the Company plans to utilize clinical trial material prepared with its 
 
11 


  proprietary manufacturing process, updated since the Phase 1/2 trial, that achieves significant productivity and quality enhancements. The Company is also incorporating the FDAs recommendations into our starting material and lot release testing plans, as well as our approach to process validation. None of these CMC changes, we believe, will affect our overall timeline. 
 Based on feedback on the pre-clinical section, AGTC has no plans at this time to conduct any additional nonclinical studies before initiation of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial. 
 Based on feedback on the clinical section, the Company has made several changes, adjusting the clinical endpoint for visual sensitivity, including two masked active arms in the Phase 2/3 study and extending analysis time prior to dosing the contralateral eye. In addition, in order to collect the strongest data set possible, the Company has decided to add a functional mobility test as one of several supplemental endpoints. The Company expects to begin this trial during the first quarter of calendar year 2021 and provide results from a six-month interim analysis during the third quarter of calendar year 2022. The data from this analysis will also be reviewed with the FDA to guide forward clinical development. 
 AGTC previously presented its microperimetry data as a change, relative to baseline, in mean sensitivity within the treated bleb region, that exceeded the inherent statistical variability of the microperimetry test itself (approximately 1.9 decibels (dB)) and believes this is an important measure of clinical benefit since it captures changes in the full treatment area. As illustrated by the mean sensitivity change from baseline in the responder sub-group figure above, an early and sustained increase in mean sensitivity was observed among responders through Month 6. The mean difference between responders treated and untreated eyes was 4.1 dB at Month 6, including a 2.7 dB mean increase in treated eyes which exceeded the 1.9 dB threshold. For context, a change of 3 dB represents a doubling in sensitivity to light. 
 A second way to analyze microperimetry data is to use pointwise analysis i.e., identify points with a given increase or decrease in sensitivity at each locus. To be consistent with communications from the FDA and mirror how other research groups in the XLRP gene therapy space are analyzing visual sensitivity data, we have adjusted our definition of a responder for the visual sensitivity endpoint to a change from baseline in visual sensitivity of at least 7 dB in at least 5 loci at Month 12, which is intended to represent a clinically meaningful benefit. Responder rates from each active arm will be compared to responder rates in the control arm. 
 We present below our re-analysis of our existing MAIA microperimetry data from centrally dosed Group 2 and Group 4 patients at Month 6. In addition, we are also reporting for the first time the same analysis from the Group 5 dose group at Month 6. 
 When the patients are analyzed using our new definition of responder, 7 of the 15 centrally treated patients from all three dose groups combined had at least 5 loci that increased by at least 7 dB  6 patients at Month 6 and 1 patient at Month 3. Focusing on the Group 5 dose group, a dose level that we are planning to move forward, in this analysis 4 of 7 patients met the response criterion. Of note, if we apply the planned inclusion/exclusion criteria for baseline visual sensitivity in the upcoming Phase 2/3 trial to the Group 5 patients, one patient would be removed, such that the responder rate in this case would be 4 of 6, or 67%. We do not currently have a complete set of Month 12 data available nor do we have a control arm in the Phase 1/2, both of which will be part of the planned Phase 2/3 trial and necessary to evaluate efficacy.

 * Month 3 data 
 Others have reported visual sensitivity using a static full field perimeter called the Octopus perimeter. This device measures visual sensitivity across a wider area of the retina, as compared to the microperimeter, to include areas outside the macula and into the periphery. As with the MAIA microperimeter, the Octopus perimetry data can be analyzed two ways. First as the mean change over the entire grid, or over a specific portion of the grid. Second using pointwise analysis i.e., plotting the points on the perimetry grid and indicating an increase or decrease in sensitivity for a given locus. We provide our Octopus data analyzed both ways below. 
 While challenging to compare across research groups due to variations in grid patterns used, and bleb placements achieved, we believe our analysis of mean change in sensitivity, reported below, shows our XLRP product produces comparable results to those reported by others using the Octopus perimeter. We believe that since the injection of the product is in the central macular region microperimetry provides a higher resolution measurement of retinal sensitivity in the target area.

 We also analyzed our Octopus perimetry data using pointwise analysis i.e., plotting the points on the perimetry grid and indicating an increase or decrease in at least 7 dB for a given locus. We provide representative data from three patients comparing the treated and untreated eyes, and which represent those with at least 5 loci increasing by at least 7 dB at the timepoints indicated.

This information, taken as a whole, reaffirms our conclusion that our data are at least comparable to that of other disclosed data from XRLP gene therapy trials. AGTC remains on track to provide the next interim analysis data readout in the second half of 2020, which will include Month 12 data from Groups 2 & 4, and a more complete month six dataset from the two higher dose groups five and six. 
 For ophthalmology studies in general, and especially with low sample sizes, there is often a concern of possible patient bias that could influence endpoints due to the psychometric nature of the test protocols, and that to the extent possible, this should be minimized. The Company received feedback on this issue of bias from the FDA and has revised its proposed Phase 2/3 trial protocol to minimize this risk. The revised protocol provides for enrollment of approximately 60 patients, and will include two masked active arms, in addition to an untreated control arm. The dose concentrations used will be 1.2E+11 vg/mL (Group 2 in the Phase 1/2 trial design) and 1.1E+12 vg/mL (Group 5 in the Phase 1/2 trial design). The Company has added an important secondary endpoint, a standardized functional mobility test, which captures real-world impacts on XLRP patients by objectively assessing changes in patient mobility that are secondary to improvements in vision resulting from therapeutic intervention. In addition, other secondary endpoints will include BCVA, full-field sensitivity threshold (FST) and changes in contrast sensitivity. 
 Based on the projected responder rate, using our new primary endpoint analysis described above, from the Phase 1/2 trial, the Phase 2/3 trial is intended to determine a difference between either active arm and the control arm. AGTC expects to begin this trial during the first quarter of calendar year 2021 and provide results from a 6-month interim analysis during the third quarter of calendar year 2022. The Company plans to submit a 6-month interim analysis of the data to the FDA to obtain feedback on the Companys development plan to support approval. Based on this feedback, we may modify the final trial design, enrollment numbers and statistical analysis plan. We also want feedback from the FDA regarding finalization of the dose selection for the treatment of the contralateral eye based on this 6-month interim data. After any adjustments made based on this feedback, if the totality of the data collected at 12 months shows a compelling benefit-risk balance, we believe it may support the submission of a BLA filing. Timing of the reporting of this data may be impacted by future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trial enrollment.

 Outline of Phase 2/3 Trial 
 

While not required prior to initiating the Phase 2/3 trial, at its discretion, the Company plans to expand its on-going Phase 1/2 trial to include 12 additional patients that will be masked and randomized to doses of 1.2E+11 vg/mL (Group 2 in original trial plan) and 1.1E+12 vg/mL (Group 5 in original trial plan). The Company expects to begin dosing in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020 and provide results from the three-month interim analysis in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2021, subject to potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trial enrollment. We expect these data to provide a near-term assessment of the correlation between changes in visual sensitivity and the patients ability to navigate the functional mobility course, the additional secondary endpoint we plan to measure in the Phase 2/3 trial. 
Outline of Expanded Phase 1/2 Trial 
 

Achromatopsia (ACHM) 
 ACHM is an inherited retinal disease, meaning that children are born with the defective gene that causes poor visual function, which significantly affects daily activities. ACHM is present from birth and throughout life and is characterized by a lack of cone photoreceptor function. Cone photoreceptors which are concentrated in the macula and the fovea, respond to moderate or bright intensity light and mediate fine visual acuity. Individuals with ACHM have markedly reduced visual acuity, photophobia or light sensitivity, and complete loss of color discrimination. Their only functioning photoreceptors are rod photoreceptors, which respond to low intensity light conditions and mediate night vision but cannot achieve fine visual acuity. Best-corrected visual acuity in persons affected by ACHM, even under subdued light conditions, is usually about 20/200, a level at which people are considered legally blind. They also experience extreme light sensitivity resulting in even worse visual acuity under normal daylight conditions, or day blindness. 
 
15 


 ACHM can be caused by mutations in any of at least five genes that are required for normal cone photoreceptor function. The most common causes are mutations in the CNGB3 gene (about half of all cases) or CNGA3 gene (about one-fourth of all cases). These genes encode the CNGB3 and CNGA3 proteins, which combine to form a channel in the photoreceptor membrane that is required for photo-transduction, the process of converting light into electrical signals that the brain can understand. According to published reports, the incidence rate for ACHM is approximately one in 30,000 people, and we therefore estimate that there are about 10,000 people in the United States and about 17,000 people in Europe with ACHM. Of these, more than 75% have disease caused by mutations in the CNGA3 or CNGB3 gene. 
 Our ACHM product candidates 
 Our gene therapy approach to treatment of ACHM involves using an AAV vector to insert a functional copy of the CNGB3 or CNGA3 gene into the patients photoreceptor cells. Our ACHM product candidates contain either the CNGB3 or the CNGA3 gene and a proprietary cone specific promoter that has been shown in preclinical studies to drive efficient gene expression in all three types of primate cone photoreceptors and restores cone photoreceptor function in dog, mouse and sheep models of ACHM. 
 Clinical development of our CNGB3 and CNGA3 related ACHM product candidate 
 We are currently enrolling patients in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials at multiple clinical sites that specialize in inherited retinal diseases. The primary endpoint of these clinical trials is safety, and while available data thus far have shown that the ACHM CNGB3 and CNGA3 product candidates are generally safe and well tolerated, we did experience initial variability in surgical procedures, which we have now resolved through our extensive surgical training procedures. In addition to safety, these trials will measure biologic activity by assessing changes in visual function and quality of life. The clinical protocols are designed as dose escalating trials to evaluate our product candidates in ACHMA3 and ACHMB3 patients at multiple dose levels. 
 We have completed enrollment of 26 and 19 patients in the dose escalation portions of the CNGB3 and CNGA3 trials, respectively. The safety profile in both trials remains favorable. We are currently enrolling pediatric patients at the two highest dose groups in each trial, although we have experienced delays in pediatric enrollment in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also taken multiple steps to address the challenges that we have faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic in assessing patients outcomes and monitoring their safety. For example, we now offer enrolled subjects the option to have testing performed near their home either by visiting a qualified local ophthalmologist, or by visiting a mobile vision center that drives to their neighborhood. The mobile vision center is equipped and staffed with certified technicians who are trained to perform important test modalities. 
 We believe that dosing the two highest dose groups, (including pediatric patients) and following patients for an extended period of time will enrich our data and build a robust set of safety and efficacy data to support our BLA filing, maximize the benefit to the greatest range of patients. 
 On January 28, 2020, we provided early achromatopsia (ACHM) data indicating biologic activity in the dose escalation portions in both the B3 and the A3 trials. At the middle dose level one of three patients in each trial and at the high dose level 2 of 3 patients in the B3 trial have shown clinically meaningful improvements, defined as greater than one log change from baseline, in light discomfort at three months. Anecdotal statements from the patients support these improvements as being meaningful to their daily lives. 
 We have also completed enrollment in a natural history study in persons affected by ACHM caused by CNGB3 mutations and CNGA3 mutations and results from the studies will be presented in appropriate scientific meetings and publications. 
 Successful completion of the Phase 1/2 clinical studies and the natural history studies will guide us in finalizing the design of the pivotal clinical trial. If successful, we believe that the results of this pivotal trial could support

  our submission of a BLA to the FDA and of a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, for our ACHM product candidates. 
 Product Candidate to Treat Advanced Retinal Disease 
 In partnership with Bionic Sight, AGTC provided pre-clinical and IND (investigational new drug) application support in Bionic Sights development of an optogenetic candidate treatment for individuals having retinitis pigmentosa (RP) who have lost light sensitivity. RP is a large group of inherited retinal disorders in which progressive degeneration of photoreceptors or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) leads to vision loss that is independent of a patients genetic mutation. In Europe and the United States, about 200,000 patients suffer from RP and every year between 15,000 and 20,000 patients with RP suffer vision loss. The clinical manifestations of affected individuals present first as defective dark adaptation or night blindness, followed by reduction of peripheral visual fields and, eventually, loss of central vision. While the photoreceptor cell layers of these patients degenerate, the ganglion cell layer remains intact. 
 Optogenetics is a biological technique by which cells are modified to express light-sensitive proteins. When the cells expressing these proteins are activated by light, they produce neural signals, which they can pass on to other neurons. Bionic Sight expresses the optogenetic proteins in the retinas ganglion cells, allowing them to send neural signals down the optic nerve to neurons in the visual areas of the brain. 
 The candidate treatment currently in clinical development by Bionic Sight is an AAV2 vector, injected intravitreally, that expresses a modified optogenetic gene, ChronosFP, in the retinal ganglion cells. The ChronosFP protein that is expressed is believed to have a more dynamic range of sensitivity and responsiveness than other optogenetic proteins being developed. In conjunction with the gene therapy treatment, Bionic Sight is developing a wearable prosthetic device that uses a novel algorithm to provide light signals to the retinal ganglion cells in a pattern similar to that produced by normal retinal cells, which gives the treatment the potential to produce images the brain can recognize and may significantly enhance vision in patients receiving the optogenetic treatment. The IND for the program was successfully cleared by the FDA, and Bionic Sight initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to test safety and potential efficacy of the treatment with the first patient treated in March 2020. Bionic Sight suspended enrollment by the clinical site due to the impact of COVID-19, but reinitiated clinical activities in July 2020 consistent with applicable COVID-19 guidelines. 
 Ongoing Research in Support for our Current and Future Clinical Programs 
 In support of our clinical programs described above, we continue to conduct research to fully understand the underlying technology. Additionally, we have initiated or continued several programs that are in early safety and preclinical proof of concept stages that are described below. 
 XLRP product candidate differentiation 
 Three subretinal AAV gene therapy vectors are currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with XLRP. To compare the relative attributes of these vectors, a study was conducted which compared the photoreceptor transduction efficiency of subretinally delivered AAVTYF, the AAV capsid used in AGTC product candidates, AAV5 and AAV8 capsids in a head-to-head NHP experiment. Non-human primates were injected with each of the vectors and were followed for 13 weeks. Safety parameters included ocular exams, clinical observations, clinical pathology, and anatomic histopathology. A direct comparison between AAVTYF (n=12), AAV5 (n=4) and AAV8 (n=8) revealed that AAVTYF was comparable to or superior to both AAV5 or AAV8 in transduction of photoreceptors in NHPs when delivered subretinally, while demonstrating a similar, moderate inflammatory response. Therefore, AAVTYF represents, an attractive therapeutic choice for human XLRP gene therapy.

Understanding the ocular inflammatory response to AAV administration 
 Both intravitreal, and to a lesser extent, subretinal administration elicits an inflammatory response to AAV. In the eye, it remains unclear what specific property of the vector preparation drives inflammation. To this end, through a series of detailed, well-controlled studies in non-human primates, we performed a systematic evaluation of the potential contributory factors involved. A brief summary of the studies conducted is shown in the table below, and the accompanying illustrative figures. 
 

Purpose | Parameters | Observations 
Vector Methodology (Transfection (TFX) versus HAVE (Herpes simplex virus system)) | Ocular inflammation following intravitreal administration | No difference in ocular inflammatory response between manufacturing methodologies 
Vector Components (Full capsids, empty capsids, process residuals) | In-life ocular inflammation, transduction efficiency and cytokine/cellular immune responses following intravitreal administration | Reduction of empty capsids lowers inflammation and enhances transduction Transient minimal response in cytokines or immune cells (local and systemic), with no clear distinction across treatment groups 
Capsid serotype (AAVTYF, AAV5, AAV8) | In-life ocular inflammation, transduction efficiency following sub-retinal administration | No difference in ocular inflammatory response between capsid serotypes, two-fold improvement of transduction efficiency with AAVTYF relative to AAV5 and AAV8 
Pre-existing Immunity (Low, Medium and High) | In-life ocular inflammation, prevention of vector transduction, and neutralizing antibody correlation between eyes following intravitreal administration | Pre-existing immunity has no impact on ocular inflammation, and is not sufficient in itself to block vector transduction Neutralizing antibody in one eye does not impact neutralizing antibody levels in the contralateral eye

 The ocular inflammation is most strongly correlated to total vector dose, and appears to occur in two phases: immediate, surgery/injection related (more explicit with sub-retinal injections) and delayed, in response to vector (processing of capsid and/or transgene expression). The studies outlined above have allowed us to eliminate the following as key drivers of inflammation: production methodology (transfection versus HSV), characteristics of the AAV product (transgene and process residuals) and capsid serotype (AAV2 versus AAV8) or novel engineered variant (AAVTYF). To date, none of the studies indicate that we should make changes in our product candidates, but we continue to work in non-human primates to understand ocular inflammation. The first publication of this work has recently been accepted by Human Gene Therapy (Timmers et al., 2019). 
 Other opportunities in ophthalmology 
 We believe that our advanced gene therapy platform will enable us to develop and test new AAV vectors that carry gene sequences both for other inherited diseases in ophthalmology (it is estimated that approximately 290 genes causing inherited retinal disease have been identified), as well as larger ocular indications for which intervention at a specific target gene or pathway has been clearly identified. By leveraging the existing work on our lead programs and further deployment of technology advances, we believe we can reduce the need for early research work. In this way, we anticipate being able to move products efficiently through preclinical studies and into clinical development. We have added two additional ophthalmology programs to our preclinical pipeline: 
 

 | Stargardts Disease: In November 2019 we selected Stargardts disease as a new orphan ophthalmology indication with a substantial patient population, defined clinical phenotype and available animal models to move forward towards the clinic. Stargardts disease is a macular dystrophy characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors leading to blindness and is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. This particular gene at ~6.8 kilobases exceeds the size packaging capacity of AAV, and therefore required the use of a novel dual AAV vector system to deliver the two halves of the gene. This was successfully accomplished, and as a result of extensive studies in a relevant abca4 knockout mouse model we have shown that the disease phenotype can be corrected with this approach (Dyka et al., 2019). We have also demonstrated that the same dual vector system results in reconstitution of the full length, functional protein in NHP retina when administered by subretinal injection. The program is positioned to proceed to IND-enabling safety and biodistribution studies.

 | Dry AMD: An estimated 15 million people in North America have age-related macular degeneration (AMD), of which 85-90 percent are diagnosed with the non-exudative dry form. This medical condition may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field, which can make it hard to recognize faces, read, drive and perform daily activities. Progression to geographic atrophy (or wet AMD) leads to serious risk of blindness. Dysregulated complement pathway is considered an important factor in the disease etiology, and a component of the alternative complement pathway, Complement Factor H (CFH), is known to have a strong genetic risk association with AMD. Patients homozygous,

or carrying two copies, of the Y402H mutation have a ~6-fold increased risk of developing AMD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
19 


 
(Sepp et al., 2006). Preclinical data in relevant animal models support the approach of CFH gene augmentation as a potential therapeutic strategy for AMD. The full length CFH gene is too large to fit into a single AAV, and so in this case, we adopted a different approach and designed multiple engineered truncated forms, testing these in combination with different promoters to determine if they retain activity. From these studies, we identified a preferred construct that retains functionality both in vitro and in vivo. For example, we have shown that the construct targets the complement cascade in the retina of a cfh knockout mouse model and have performed expression studies in NHP retina. The program is positioned to proceed to IND-enabling safety and biodistribution studies.

Central Nervous System 
 An additional strategic area of focus for AGTC is in the central nervous system, or CNS, where we see unique opportunities to leverage our comprehensive capabilities in vector design, delivery and manufacturing to address severe unmet medical needs in several diseases. We are actively developing three opportunities and have established a world-class scientific advisory board to assist and guide our efforts as we advance these programs through preclinical development: 

 | Frontotemporal dementia (FTD): FTD is a degenerative brain disorder, second only to Alzheimers disease in terms of prevalence and incidence in the dementia spectrum, is on the rise due to the aging population and has no approved treatments. Mutations in the Progranulin (PGRN) gene are one of the three main genetic causes of FTD, representing approximately 20% of familial FTD, and accounting for 3000 to 6000 cases in the US. PGRN is a glycoprotein that undergoes protease enzyme-dependent cleavage into smaller subunits called granulins, and these granulins may play a key role in inflammation, wound repair, tumorigenesis and sexual differentiation. PGRN is critical in neurons for proper trafficking and function of lysosomal enzymes such as ß-glucocerebrosidase and cathepsin D. PGRN haploinsufficiency (the loss of gene expression from one allele, resulting in reduced levels) is causally connected to FTD, and PGRN-deficient neurons are prone to accumulation of the protein TDP-43, which is thought to then lead to neurodegeneration. We are seeking to the augment PGRN levels in order to restore its physiological balance, and this approach is supported by several studies in PGRN-deficient mouse models, where both the pathological and behavioral changes that occur as a result of PGRN loss have been rescued (Arrant et al., 2017, 2018). Following extensive preclinical analysis exploring different capsid, promoter and transgene combinations, we have devised a novel AAV construct to enhance PGRN expression in the brain following direct vector administration into the cerebrospinal fluid, and have data in NHP measuring cerebrospinal fluid levels of PGRN, confirming that projected therapeutic levels are achievable within a defined dose range. The program is now positioned to proceed to IND-enabling safety and biodistribution studies.

 | Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): ALS (Lou Gehrigs disease) is an autosomal dominant, fatal adult onset disease with no truly effective therapy. It is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease, with approximately ~30,000 cases in the US, and is characterized by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Early symptoms are of muscle weakness that progresses and then ultimately results in respiratory failure, with death usually occurring within 3 to 5 years of first symptoms. There are both sporadic (~90%) and familial (~10%) forms of the disease, with the most common genetic cause linked to the C9orf72 gene, representing 30-40% of cases. C9orf72 mutations are also present in FTD. C9orf72 gene six nucleotide repeat expansions can result in both gain-of-toxicity and loss-of-function, both of which are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis in C9orf72-related disease. Targeting of such repeat sequences with antisense oligonucleotides or artificial microRNAs, for example, has been shown to reduce the accumulation of intra-nuclear transcripts (Martier et al., 2019). We are working on a novel integrated therapeutic approach that we believe has the potential to fully address all of the cellular deficits associated with the mutations and are currently in the process of identifying the optimal combination of components through different library screening strategies.

20 


 
 | Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD): This disease is an X-linked disorder of fatty acid metabolism that leads to accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body, mainly in the central nervous system and the adrenal gland. Patients with ALD cannot break down long-chain fatty acids, leading to their accumulation in cells of the nervous system, brain and adrenal gland. This leads to progressive loss of the membrane that insulates nerves in the brain and spinal cord and may cause damage to the outer layer of the adrenal gland. Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder with several distinct phenotypes, including rapidly declining neurological function and early death in young boys or progressive muscular weakness leading to lower limb paralysis in adults. There are approximately 14,000 patients with ALD in the United States. Early data from our preclinical studies support a gene therapy-based approach to treating the disease and warrant advancing it to our preclinical pipeline. We have made significant progress on vector design, animal model proof of concept and targeting studies in NHP in order to obtain data to support moving a potential product candidate to IND enabling studies.

Otology 
 Hearing loss is one of the most common human sensory deficits and it is estimated that nearly half of the cases have a genetic origin. Of the inherited forms of hearing loss, more than 300 genetic causes have been defined with the specific gene identified for more than 70. Despite the impairment that can be caused by deafness, very little progress has been made in developing therapies that go beyond the temporary and partial solutions provided by hearing aids and cochlear implants. In multiple academic research studies, replacement of defective genes in animal models with normal copies has been shown to improve sound propagation in the auditory hair cells, making this a potentially promising application of AAV gene therapy. Additionally, the inner ear shares many of the characteristics that make ophthalmology attractive: it is anatomically well defined and is a small, well contained space where the target cells to be treated are easily identified. Also, the clinical outcome measures for treatments for hearing loss are well defined. 
 Developing product candidates for conditions having these characteristics is a natural complement to our ophthalmology and CNS portfolio strategy as we apply our core capabilities and expertise to a new disease field. As part of our efforts in otology, we formed a scientific advisory board and have conducted a detailed evaluation of the development and commercial landscape. From these efforts, we have selected targets which we believe are technically feasible and commercially viable. 
 

 | DFNB1: In September 2019, we announced that we had entered into a strategic collaboration with Otonomy, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for neurotology, to co-develop and co-commercialize an AAV-based gene therapy to restore hearing in patients with sensorineural hearing loss caused by a mutation in the gap junction protein beta 2 gene (GJB2). Mutations in GJB2 account for approximately 30% of all genetic hearing loss cases, representing approximately 1000-2000 new cases each year in the US, and patients with this mutation can have severe-to-profound deafness in both ears that is identified in screening tests routinely performed in newborns. The GJB2 gene encodes connexin-26, which is expressed in cochlear support cells, forming gap junctions that control potassium homeostasis which is critical for the survival and function of hair cells and normal hearing. Mutations in GJB2 impair gap junctions and cochlear homeostasis leading to hair cell dysfunction and hearing loss.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The goal of GJB2 gene therapy is to restore functional gap junctions and preserve hair cells to improve hearing by providing a copy of the wild-type gene to support cells. In order to identify the optimal AAV components to achieve this, we have actively screened novel capsid variants in mouse, guinea-pig and NHP for their ability to transduce the support cells of the cochlear. Below is a representative example from one such study in NHP demonstrating GFP reporter transgene expression by immunohistochemistry (shown as brown staining in the figure) in the target cell types. 
 
21 


 
The Joint Steering Committee finalized selection of all components for the proposed lead candidate including the identification of a proprietary novel capsid, and a series of confirmatory preclinical efficacy and expression studies in mouse and NHPs will support progress into a planned IND-enabling GLP toxicology and biodistribution study expected to begin in the first half of 2021. 
 Strategic collaborations 
 We have formed strategic alliances in which both parties contribute expertise to enable the discovery and development of potential gene therapy product candidates. To access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize gene therapy products, we intend to seek additional opportunities to form strategic alliances with collaborators who can augment our industry-leading gene therapy expertise. 
 On October 1, 2019, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Otonomy, Inc., a San Diego based biopharmaceutical company focused on neurotology. We plan to work with Otonomy to develop and commercialize gene therapy products for genetic forms of hearing loss with an initial focus on GJB2, which is the most common cause of congenital hearing loss. The collaboration leverages our experience and technology in the development and design of optimized AAV gene therapy products with Otonomys expertise in preclinical and clinical development for neurotology products. 
 Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we and Otonomy share the expenses and any revenue or other proceeds equally for jointly developed products. Thus far, the focus of our efforts has been to design and test the optimal product construct, including the identification of a novel capsid with tropism for the target tissues. These results supported selection of the product candidate for further development. 
 On February 2, 2017, we entered into a strategic research and development collaboration agreement with Bionic Sight to develop therapies for patients with visual deficits and blindness due to retinal disease. Through the AGTC-Bionic Sight collaboration, the companies seek to develop a new optogenetic therapy that leverages AGTCs deep experience in gene therapy and ophthalmology and Bionic Sights innovative neuro-prosthetic device and algorithm for retinal coding. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, AGTC provided in-kind support aggregating $2.2 million to Bionic Sight in the form of ongoing research and development efforts focused activities required to file an IND for a selected product candidate and to achieve successful clearance by a relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB), both of which are required before a clinical trial can proceed. In addition to the in-kind activities, AGTC made two payments to Bionic Sight in exchange for equity based on a predetermined valuation, an initial $2.0 million payment upon signing the collaboration agreement and a second payment of $4.0 million upon receipt of an IND clearance from the FDA and receipt of written approval from an IRB to conduct clinical trials from at least one clinical site for that product candidate. Our aggregate equity ownership in Bionic Sight currently is 15.5%. 
 
22 


 Bionic Sight is responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which enrolled its first patient in March 2020, and we have no further obligations under the agreement. Upon completion of the trial or the achievement of certain pre-agreed definitions of potential efficacy, we have an exclusive option to negotiate to license or partner the program. If we and Bionic Sight are not able to reach agreement after a defined timeframe, Bionic Sight may negotiate with third parties but only on terms that are no more favorable to the third party than last offered by us without our consent. 
 We will continue to seek to partner with other gene therapy companies and academic institutions to leverage our expertise in vector design, research, manufacturing and the regulatory process. The goal of these collaborations would be to forge strategic partnerships around technologies and programs that would fit with our current and future development pipeline. In general, we would seek new intellectual property, development programs in rare diseases, pipeline products where the regulatory pathway is understood, partners with strong scientific, clinical, commercialization and management expertise, and programs that have synergy with our current knowledge base and product pipeline that would add to our industry leadership. We would also be looking at programs where the disease being treated has a large enough patient population that there would be adequate financial returns for the investment of resources. 
 Our relationship with the University of Florida 
 All of our scientific founders spent part of their careers at the University of Florida, or UF, and two are still UF faculty members. Since our inception we have licensed significant technology from and funded research at multiple labs at UF. Pursuant to four agreements, we have licensed three U.S. patents and multiple pending applications covering inventions made at UF. UF has multiple capabilities in genetic cloning, gene therapy manufacturing, novel capsid identification, animal model development and facilities for both small and large animal testing and, in certain instances, we have benefited from the ability to conduct important research at UF without having to expand in-house facilities and personnel. 
 In May 2013, we and UF were jointly awarded an $8.3 million grant from the National Eye Institute to support development of our ACHM CNGB3 product candidate, with Dr. William Hauswirth, one of our scientific founders, a Professor and holder of the Rybaczki-Bullard Chair in the Department of Ophthalmology at UF, as principal investigator. As of June 30, 2020, we have received payments in the aggregate amount of $3.4 million under this grant. 
 Our relationships with patient advocacy groups and academic centers 
 We have long believed that when developing product candidates to treat orphan indications it is important to form strong relationships with patient advocacy groups, and we have done this successfully with both the Foundation Fighting Blindness, or FFB (U.S.), FFB (Canada) and other organizations that are well known for their advocacy of patients interests in obtaining diagnosis, developing treatments and providing for reimbursement. Many actively support research into treatment, and we have been awarded three research grants totaling $1.6 million from the FFB (U.S.) More importantly, both organizations have been instrumental in assisting us in forming ties with disease experts, recruiting patients into clinical trials and helping us to understand the needs, wants and concerns of patients. We also have relationships with other advocacy organizations such as Achroma Corp, the BCM Family Foundation, MOMS For Sight, Curing Retinal Blindness Foundation, Sofia Sees Hope, National Organization for Rare Disorders,), Italian Achromatopsia Association (IAA), and Alliance for Regenerative Medicine. 
 In order to gain further patient specific insight to support our later stage ophthalmology clinical development, we have formed a Patient Advisory Council comprised of individuals with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) and members from the global community of organizations that represent them. AGTCs Patient Advisory Council will initially focus on providing input on XLRP clinical trial patient experiences, processes, recruitment, and enrollment. In addition, the council will serve as consultants on ongoing and future clinical trial activities, 
 
23 


  including protocol design, patient registries, development of patient outreach and education materials, and will liaise with AGTCs Scientific Advisory Board and the broader healthcare providing community. In addition, we have formed strong relationships with key academic centers across the United States that have core competencies in gene therapy, orphan ophthalmology and other disease areas, such as CNS and otology, that we have an interest in. These centers conduct sponsored research, act as advisors and collaborate with us on grant proposals. Since our inception, we have been awarded a variety of grant funding, either independently or with our collaborators. This funding has provided peer-reviewed scientific validation of our programs and has facilitated critical early stage research for our lead product candidates. 
 Intellectual property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties and seeking patent term extensions where available. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. In addition to intellectual property and trade secrets, we also will rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity for our product candidates, when possible. 
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. 
 We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development, commercialization and manufacture of gene therapy product candidates. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain genes and promoters, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, processes to manufacture our AAV-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product candidates. 
 As of July 28, 2020, our patent portfolio included approximately 100 patents and patent applications that we own and approximately 50 patents and patent applications that we have licensed. More specifically, we own 6 U.S. patents, 10 pending U.S. applications, 64 foreign patents and 20 foreign patent applications. We have licensed 6 U.S. patents, 1 pending U.S. application, 40 foreign patents and 1 pending foreign patent application. Of the patents and patent applications that we own or license, 37 cover methods to manufacture AAV vectors, the longest lived and most significant of which is expected to expire in 2029. In October 2017, we were awarded US Patent Number 9,783,826 directed to methods of producing recombinant AAV viral particles using suspension BHK cells. This patent extends the protection on our AAV manufacturing platform from 2025 to 2029. 
 Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our gene therapy product candidates and AAV manufacturing process. Our owned and licensed patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to our XLRS, ACHM, and XLRP programs, as well as our foundational AAV production platform. See also License agreements. 
 
24 


 In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop product candidates based on our proprietary intellectual property and to expand our intellectual property portfolio. 
 The term of individual patents depends on the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The issued patents that are material to our business are expected to expire on various dates from 2022 to 2029. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent per approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple product candidates, it can only be extended based on one product candidate. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 License agreements 
 We have rights to use and exploit multiple technologies disclosed in issued and pending patents under licenses from other entities. We consider the commercial terms of these licenses, which provide for modest milestone and royalty payments, and their provisions regarding diligence, insurance, indemnification and other similar matters, to be reasonable and customary for our industry. 
 Information about our principal licenses is set forth below. 
 The University of Florida 
 We currently have four agreements with the University of Florida Research Foundation, or UFRF, an affiliate of UF, of which the principal licenses are as follows: 

 | A joint license from UFRF and Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, signed in October 2003 relates to a particular HSV construct and various compositions thereof. We have an exclusive license in all fields of use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
25 


 Under the terms of this license, we made cash and stock-based up-front payments to UFRF and JHU and are required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product candidate, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under this license with respect to any individual product candidate that we commercialize will be $0.5 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the low-double digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the low four figures under this license, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. 
 This license will terminate upon the earlier to occur of the expiration of all of the patents subject to the license and the date on which royalty payments, once commenced, cease for more than three calendar quarters. Additionally, UFRF and JHU may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the license and we may terminate the license at any time by submitting written notice to UFRF. 
 The longest-lived patent covered by this license is expected to expire in 2022. 
 

 | Two licenses from UFRF, signed in September and November 2012, respectively, relate to the use of engineered AAV capsids. We have an exclusive license to the patents covered by the November 2012 license in the fields of ACHM, XLRS and XLRP and a semi-exclusive license in all other fields of orphan ophthalmology. We have a non-exclusive license in all fields of use with respect to the patents covered by the September 2012 license. Currently these patents are most useful for ACHM, XLRS and XLRP but could be important for treating a wide variety of diseases as the engineered capsids have been shown to be able to enter cells more effectively than standard AAV capsids.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the terms of these licenses, we made cash up-front payments to UFRF and are required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product candidate, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under these licenses with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.6 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the mid-single digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the mid four figures under these licenses, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. 
 On April 20, 2020, we amended the capsid license to add further rights to these licenses in exchange for a non-exclusive grant-back of the intellectual property for use by UF investigators to enable research on four gene targets that are not of strategic interest to AGTC. In exchange, we will receive pre-defined portion of any proceeds received any UFRF if they enter into a license agreement for these gene targets with a third party. Further, UFRF agrees that it will notify us of potential license opportunities any of the four gene targets, so long as not otherwise restricted by confidentiality agreements with third parties. 
 These licenses will continue until the expiration of all of the patents subject to the licenses, provided or, if later, a date specified in the license. Additionally, UFRF may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the licenses and we may terminate the licenses at any time by submitting written notice to UFRF. 
 The longest-lived patent covered by these licenses is expected to expire in 2029. There are also patent applications pending under these licenses.

 | An Evaluation and License Agreement from UFRF, signed in May 2019, relates to the use of engineered AAV capsids in the field of otology. Under the terms of the agreement, we undertook the evaluation of multiple promising capsid candidates for potential application in otology. In December 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement for three capsids that showed the most potential to support therapeutic development. Under the terms of the license agreement, we made a cash up-front payments to UFRF and will be required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product candidate, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under these licenses with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.25 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the mid-single digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the low four figures under these licenses until such time as royalties on commercial sales exceeds these amounts.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham 
 A license agreement from the UAB Research Foundation affiliated with The University of Alabama at Birmingham, signed in 2006, relates to one U.S. patent with claims covering the use of HSV helpers to produce AAV vectors. The patent is expected to expire in 2025. Effective in July 2015, we modified the license from co-exclusive to exclusive. 
 Under the terms of this license, we made a cash up-front payment to the UAB Research Foundation, and we will be required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development and regulatory milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of these development and regulatory milestones not more than once for each product, which we expect will be the case, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under this license with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.5 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the mid-single digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the mid-four figures under this license, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. 
 This license will terminate upon the expiration of all of the patents subject to the license. Additionally, the UAB Research Foundation may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the license and we may terminate the license at any time by submitting written notice to the UAB Research Foundation. 
 Collaborations with 4DMT and Synpromics 
 In April 2015, we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with 4D to discover and develop optimized AAV vectors to treat specific ophthalmic disease indications. The AGTC Agreement expired in October 2018 when AGTC chose to not exercise its option to license during the option period. We continue to collaborate with Synpromics, acquired by AskBio in 2019, a company focused on synthetic promoter technology, bioinformatics and data-driven design that enables more precise cell targeting and gene expression. AGTC and Synpromics are engaged in the research and development of novel synthetic promoters that could be potentially useful in the product candidates under development by AGTC.

 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the gene therapy field, are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary technology estate and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies. 
 Currently there are no approved products for any of our lead orphan ophthalmology indications of ACHM and XLRP. We are aware of a number of companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications, including Adverum Biotechnologies Inc., Akous, Allergan plc, Apic Bio, Inc., Axovant, Biogen Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Decibel Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Inc., 4D Molecular Therapeutics, GenSight Biologics S.A., Gyroscope Therapeutics Limited, Hemera Biosciences, Limelight Bio, Inc., MeiraGTx Limited (partnered with Janssen Pharmaceuticals ), IVERIC bio, Oxford Biomedica plc, Passage Bio, Prevail Therapeutics, ProQR Therapeutics N.V., REGENXBIO Inc., the Roche Group (acquiring Spark Therapeutics), Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and uniQure N.V., as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates. For XLRP, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, MeiraGTx and Biogen are developing AAV-based gene therapies and MeiraGTx also has competing programs in ACHM-B3 and ACHM-A3. We believe that these companies and others could be planning to initiate clinical trials in the future that have the potential to be competitive with AGTCs programs. We further believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition, market exclusivity and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
Government Regulation 
 Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Before clinical testing of biological products may begin, we must submit an IND which must go into effect, and each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA also must be obtained before marketing of biological products in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. CBER works closely with the NIH, both of which may engage in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs, and gene therapy products for rare diseases and retinal disorders. 
 
28 


 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research have led to the enactment of legislation such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 and could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any product candidates. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Recent developments in regulation of gene therapy 
 In August 2017, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) became the first gene therapy product approved by the FDA. It was followed by four additional gene therapy product approvals, including Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) in December 2017. The Luxturna approval is of relevance to AGTC because it is a subretinally administered AAV vector that treats patients with a rare form of inherited vision loss. It is also the first FDA approved gene therapy that targets a disease caused by mutations in a specific gene. 
 FDAs acknowledged recognition of the promise of gene therapy and their expectation that the field will continue to expand has led it to take additional steps to support the advancement of gene therapy products. In January 2020, the FDA finalized six gene therapy guidance documents, which address manufacturing and clinical development. One guidance document provides FDAs recommendations for gene therapy product development and clinical trial design specifically for retinal disorders. AGTCs review of the FDAs recommendations found we are aligned with the agencys approach to product development and we see opportunities to advance our programs as anticipated following the collection of appropriate safety and efficacy data. 
 In Europe, seven gene therapy products have been approved. In 2012, the EMA approved a gene therapy product called Glybera, which is the first gene therapy product approved by regulatory authorities anywhere in the Western world. Most recently, Zolgensma became the seventh gene therapy product approved by the EMA. 
 United States biological products development process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to applicable good laboratory practices, or GLP, requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practice, or GCP, standards and IND and human subject protection regulations, and requirements to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | validation of the biological product candidate manufacturing and control processes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product candidate is produced to assess compliance with GMP requirements, to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product candidates identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
29 


 
 | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product candidate in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product candidate, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including applicable GLP requirements. 
 Sponsors or institutions receiving NIH funding are responsible for compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. However, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The oversight bodies at the clinical site(s) (Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)) are responsible for determining whether or not the clinical study may be conducted there. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, although IND sponsors generally wait until the FDA affirmatively provides notice that the agency has no issues with the IND. Under the FD&C Act, the FDA has the authority to prohibit a sponsor from conducting a clinical trial, referred to as a clinical hold, if the investigational product poses an unreasonable risk to the safety of trial subjects, taking into account the qualifications of the clinical investigators, information about the drug, the design of the clinical investigation, the condition for which the drug is to be investigated, and the health status of the subjects involved, or for any other reason the FDA has established by regulation, which are numerous and include, for example, deficiencies in study design or insufficient information to assess the risks to the subjects of a proposed study. If the FDA places the clinical trial on clinical hold within the 30-day time period after submission of an IND, the IND sponsor must address the FDAs concerns and the FDA must life the clinical hold before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, the FDA may seek advice from the FDAs Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee at any time on data, including preclinical data, related to the safety, effectiveness, and appropriate use of gene transfer therapies. This Advisory Committee consists of members selected by the FDA Commissioner considered to be authorities knowledgeable in the fields of gene therapies and related specialties. If the FDA recommends public review of the protocol or seeks comments from the Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, initiation of the clinical trial could be delayed. The FDA may also impose a clinical hold at any time during the conduct of a clinical trial due to, for example, new safety concerns, another drug under investigation or approved for the same indication and available to the same patient population has demonstrated a better potential benefit/risk balance, or one or more adequate and well-controlled studies strongly suggest the lack of effectiveness. A trial on clinical hold may be initiated or continued when the FDA lifts the hold in writing and then only under terms specified by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including rules that ensure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the GCP standards, human subject protection

  requirements, and FDAs investigational new drug requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, be combined, or be bifurcated into two parts: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be required as a condition of approval or may be recommended after initial marketing approval if required. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Depending on the type of product and mechanism of action, the FDA may recommend that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events as part of a long-term follow up before licensure, which may include annual examinations and/or annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects. After licensure, the FDA may recommend the establishment of a patient registry specifically to collect adverse event data from gene therapy patients. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Although the FDA has approved five gene therapy products in the United States, gene therapy remains a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions. Consequently, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. Over the last several years the FDA has issued helpful guidance on development of gene therapy products and has recently finalized a guidance for gene therapy products for rare diseases in which the FDA shows an increased willingness to work closely with developers and encourages ongoing interactions with sponsors throughout the development process. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 United States review and approval processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product candidate. The BLA must include results of laboratory, animal and human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDAs fee schedule for fiscal year 2021, which becomes effective October 1, 2020, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is $2,875,842. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee ($336,432) for certain approved products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity 
 
32 


  profile, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with GMP regulations to ensure and preserve the product candidates identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, such as the Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure the safe use of the biological product candidate. A REMS may be imposed to ensure safe use of the drug, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to ensure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. If information from such an inspection, or from any other source, raises a significant question about the integrity of the clinical data, the FDA may suspend review of the BLA under its Application Integrity Policy, or AIP. After AIP has been invoked, FDA will not resume substantive review of any pending application unless and until the data have been validated. To ensure data integrity and GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping, production, and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product candidate. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological products safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. If the FDA issues a complete response letter at the end of the initial review cycle and the sponsor resubmits its BLA addressing all deficiencies, a new two or six-month review cycle will begin, depending on the extent of the deficiencies to be addressed.

 Orphan-drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan-drug designation to a drug or biological product candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product candidate. Orphan-drug designation must be requested before submitting a New Drug Application, or NDA, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan-drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan-drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan-drug designation may also be rescinded if the product candidate no longer meets the criteria for designation. 
 If a product candidate that has orphan-drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years; however, the FDA has not yet established what characteristics of a gene therapy product are relevant to determining whether two gene therapy products would be considered the same for purposes of orphan drug market exclusivity. In January 2020, the FDA issued a draft guidance in which the FDA proposed its interpretation of the sameness criterion for determining whether a gene therapy product will be eligible for orphan drug market exclusivity. The FDA proposed to consider two gene therapy products for the same indication to be different, thus each eligible for market exclusivity, if they have different transgenes and different vectors, different transgenes regardless of whether they have the same vectors, or different vectors from a different viral class. The public docket to submit comments on the draft guidance closed on July 28, 2020. There is no required timeframe within which the FDA must complete its review of comments and decide whether to revise the guidance, finalize it as proposed, or withdraw it. 
 The FDA may approve a second drug or biological product during an exclusivity period in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product does not have exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as determined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite and facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and shown to have the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product candidate at any time during the clinical development of the product candidate. Unique to a Fast Track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if: the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application; the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable; and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 
34 


 In addition to the Fast Track program, the FDA provides other expedited programs for qualifying product candidates, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and aims to review such applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review. Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. A drug or biological product will qualify for accelerated approval if the product treats a serious or life-threatening illness and, based on adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, is shown generally to provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or an intermediate clinical endpoint (i.e., an endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality) that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product candidate perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, the pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and receive the same benefits as drugs with Fast Track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Following the establishment of the breakthrough therapy designation, FDA established the regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation in conjunction with the 2016 21st Century Cures Act. Like the breakthrough designation, the RMAT designation requires preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs. However, the RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over the available therapies, which the breakthrough therapy designation does. Fast Track, breakthrough therapy, and RMAT designations may also be rescinded if the product candidate does not continue to meet the designation criteria. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release. In this case, as part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on 
 
35 


  each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 FDA regulations prohibit the promotion of an investigational product for an unapproved use, which may include certain company-sponsored scientific and educational activities if the content of those activities is not independent of a companys influence or control. The FDA distinguishes impermissible promotion of an investigational product from the permissible exchange of scientific and medical information among healthcare professionals, which may include company-sponsored scientific and educational activities if the content of those activities is free of company influence or control. The FDA has issued Warning Letters and untitled letters to sponsors and clinical investigators who have claimed, directly or indirectly, that an investigational product is safe and effective for its intended use. 
 FDA regulations also impose requirements and limitations on advertising and promotional activities specifically for approved biological products. While a BLA is still under review, the BLA applicant must submit to the FDA copies of all promotional materials intended for use within 120 days following BLA approval, after which time the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of use, unless otherwise directed by the FDA. For all drug and biological products, the FD&C Act prohibits false or misleading labeling, which includes statements in promotional materials about the products safety, effectiveness, and indications for use. The FDAs regulations require advertising and promotional materials and activities to provide, among other things, adequate safety and risk information and fair balance, and prohibit the promotion of products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the products approved labeling (known as off-label use). In addition, FDA has published guidelines, which include limitations on direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional activities via the Internet and social media. The failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in Warning Letters to come into compliance and the FDA further requesting the cessation or revision of marketing materials and activities or the dissemination of corrective marketing materials. The FDA has the authority to seek an injunction to stop the dissemination of violative marketing materials and activities if adequate corrective actions are not taken voluntarily. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA has the authority to take a variety of actions to address violations, including invoking the AIP and suspending the review of a pending application; refusing to approve or withdrawing approval of a marketing application; placing a study on clinical hold; issuing warning or untitled letters; ordering a biological product recall; seizing product in distribution; seeking an injunction to stop manufacture and distribution of a product; seeking restitution, disgorgement of profits, and fines; and debarring a company and its executives individually from participation in any capacity in the drug approval process. The U.S. Department of Justice has the authority to criminally prosecute companies and company executives for violations of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act.

 United States patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending on the timing, duration and specifics of product development and the FDA review of a BLA, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a study. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 The BPCI Act provides a reference biologic for 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. On June 23, 2016, the Price Relief, Innovation, and Competition for Essential Drugs (PRICED) Act (H.R. 5573) was introduced, which would have reduced exclusivity for reference biological drugs from 12 to seven years. The PRICED Act was reintroduced on June 20, 2019 (H.R. 3379) and, if passed into law, would reduce exclusivity for reference biological drugs from 12 to five years. The BPCI Act also provides that the first biologic product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicants favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.

 Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Given the potential for long term durable therapeutic benefit from the single administration of a gene therapy product, the question of appropriate pricing and method of payment, including annuity payments and pay for performance schemes, is currently an active discussion and, depending on outcome, could affect the use of our products and our financial performance. 
 Other healthcare laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development expenses were $35.8 million and $33.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
 Employees 
 As of June 30, 2020, we had 83 full-time employees, 48 of whom have Ph.D., M.D. or other post-graduate degrees. Of these full-time employees, 60 were engaged in research and development activities and 23 were engaged in finance, human resources, facilities and general management. 
 Effective July 1, 2019 and through June 30, 2020, all of our personnel were co-employees of AGTC and a professional human resource service organization, Insperity PEO Services, L.P., or Insperity. Insperity replaced TriNet HR Corporation as our professional human resource service organization on July 1, 2019. Under our agreement with Insperity, Insperity is a co-employer of our personnel and is responsible for administering all payroll functions, including tax withholding, and providing health insurance and other benefits to those individuals. We reimburse Insperity for these costs and pay Insperity an administrative fee for its services. We are responsible for, and control, all aspects of the hiring, retention, compensation, management and supervision of our personnel. We consider the terms of our contract with Insperity to be reasonable and customary and believe that this arrangement provides substantial benefit to us in the form of lower costs for employee benefits and a reduced administrative burden on us.
