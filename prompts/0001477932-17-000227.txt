Through a series of mergers and acquisitions in 2009 and 2010, the Company acquired the following entities, all of which the Company maintains control through a majority ownership:

(Hunza), a Colombian limited liability corporation that holds various mining concessions in the Boyacá Province of east-central Colombia. The Colombian government has suspended the Hunza Projects mining permits and the Company has written off all related assets and liabilities.

Change of the Company Business

On October 7, 2014, Mr. William D. Gross, the holder of the MMEX Preferred Shares, accrued dividends on the Preferred Shares and certain MMEX convertible notes payable (the "Instruments"), entered into an assignment agreement to assign the Instruments to Maple Project Finance, LLC ("MPF"), and in turn, on October 9, 2014, MPF assigned the Instruments to Maple Structure Holdings, LLC ("MSH").

On May 18, 2015, the MMEX Board of Director approved these transactions. On November 10, 2015, 123,283,700 shares of common stock were issued to MSH for conversion of the MMEX Preferred Shares and on May 2, 2016, 194,999,999 shares of common stock were issued to MSH for conversion of the convertible notes payable.

The Company amended its articles of incorporation on April 6, 2016 to change its corporate name to MMEX Resources Corporation and to increase the authorization of the Company to issue up to 1,010,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 10,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock, $.001 par value ("Preferred Stock"), and 1,000,000,000 shares shall be Common Stock, $.001 par value ("Common Stock").

Issuance of Common Shares and Recent Financings

As MMEX continues to expand its business and implement its business strategy, its current monthly cash flow requirements will exceed its near-term cash flows from operations. In order to fund its development costs the Company completed a series of private placements and one transaction under Section 3 (a)(10) of the Securities Act.

(i) Qualified Investor Financing. The Company completed subscription agreements with qualified investors from July 1, 2015 to December 12, 2016 in the total amount of $178,230 in cash and services.

(ii) Section 3(a) (10) Financing –Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Rockwell Capital Partners, Inc. (“RCP”). Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, RCP has purchased certain outstanding payables between the Company and designated vendors totaling $109,391 (the “Payables” or “Claims”) and will exchange the portion of such Payables assigned for a Settlement Amount payable in common shares of the Company. In settlement of the Claims, the Company has issued and delivered to RCP, in one or more tranches as necessary, shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”), subject to adjustment and ownership limitations as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, sufficient to satisfy the Claims amount at a 50% discount to market based on the market price during the valuation period as defined in the Settlement Agreement. The Company also issued 7,000,000 shares of Common Stock to RCP as a settlement fee. On October 28, 2016, a circuit court in Florida issued an order confirming the fairness of the terms of the Settlement Agreement within the meaning of exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a) (10) of the Securities Act of 1933.
