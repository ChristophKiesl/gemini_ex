Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, reorganization, stock purchase, or similar business combination (a “Business Combination”) with one or more businesses, which we refer to in this Report as our initial Business Combination. We have not selected any specific target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any target with respect to an initial Business Combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to administrative and organizational activities related to our public offering.
 
We believe there are a number of enterprises that could be attractive merger partners for our company. While our management has unique operating and investment experience in a wide variety of industries, we intend to focus on consumer-focused enterprises, including e-commerce, on the energy services and renewables sector and on the insurance and financial services sector. Our efforts will be focused on finding companies which we believe have significant growth prospects in an attractive industry with a clear and identifiable pathway to cash flow generation and growth. We intend to identify a target enterprise where our experience, relationships, and expertise will add value to the company’s strategic outlook and operations. We will be focused on generating attractive returns and creating value while adhering to the highest code of ethical conduct and governance practices.
 
We were originally formed in Delaware under the name Riverview Acquisition Corp. in February 2021. Our executive offices are located at 700 Colonial Road, Suite 101, Memphis, TN 38117, and our telephone number is (901) 767-5576. Our corporate website address is www.riverviewacquisition.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.
 
Our Management Team
 
We are led by an experienced team of executives who have played important roles in helping build and grow profitable public and private businesses. Our management team has worked together on investments for years, and we operate with a shared set of core values.
 
We will seek to capitalize on the significant investment experience and contacts of R. Brad Martin, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and our Chief Executive Officer, Charles K. Slatery, our President and Chief Investment Officer, William V. Thompson III, our Treasurer, Secretary and Chief Financial Officer, and Anderee Berengian, our Vice President, to identify, evaluate, acquire and operate a target business.
 
R. Brad Martin
 
R. Brad Martin, our Chairman and CEO, has significant experience in executive leadership, corporate strategy, public company governance, and entrepreneurial ventures. Mr. Martin is the Retired Chairman and CEO of Saks Incorporated, having retired from Saks in 2007 after having served nearly 20 years as Chairman and CEO of that firm and its predecessor company. Martin was the lead investor in RBM Acquisition Company, an entity which acquired Saks’ predecessor business, Proffitt’s Incorporated in 1984. Martin became the Chief Executive Officer of Proffitt’s in 1989 when it was operating 10 stores and generating annual revenues of approximately $70 million. Over the subsequent decade, Proffitt’s grew to become one of the largest traditional department store businesses in the United States generating annualized revenues of approximately $4 billion. In 1998, Proffitt’s acquired Saks Holdings, merged it into Proffitt’s, and renamed the combined enterprise Saks Incorporated. While continuing to upgrade the Saks Fifth Avenue store base, Martin recognized the continuing consolidation of the mid-range department store industry and developed and executed a strategy to divest the traditional department store assets. Saks Incorporated shareholders received hundreds of millions of dollars of special dividends as a result of these transactions, and during the 18-year period when Martin served as CEO and Chairman of Proffitt’s/Saks, the value of its stock increased substantially.

In 1987, Martin co-founded Corporate Child Care Incorporated designed to serve the emerging market of employer-based childcare services. Martin was the company’s first CEO and recruited its long-term management team. Corporate Child Care grew successfully and became a public company trading on the NASDAQ under the name “Corporate Family Solutions.” The company subsequently merged with Bright Horizons to become part of the largest corporate-affiliated childcare company in the United States.

In the wake of the oil price collapse in March, 2020, related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Saudi Arabia/Russia supply disputes, Martin and his fellow directors oversaw Chesapeake’s entry into Chapter 11 proceedings and subsequent emergence on February 9, 2021, as a healthy enterprise with significant value preserved for its stakeholders.
 
Martin currently serves as Chairman of RBM Ventures, his family office, and as a member of the Board of Directors of FedEx Corporation where he chairs the Audit Committee. He is also Lead Director of the Board of Managers of Pilot/Flying J—North America’s largest travel center company owned jointly by a private family and Berkshire Hathaway.

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify, acquire, and complete our initial Business Combination with a company in order to further accelerate the growth of that company in the public markets. The target company can benefit from the managerial and operational experience of our management team, additional capital, and access to public securities markets. Our acquisition process will leverage our management team’s vast network of business and personal contacts, ranging from owners of private companies, directors of private and public companies, private equity and venture capital funds, investment banking relationships, commercial bank and lending relationships, attorneys, accountants, and personal friendships. Over the course of their careers, our management team has developed a broad network of diverse contacts that we believe will serve as a useful sources of acquisition opportunities. We plan to utilize the network and industry experience of our management team in seeking an initial Business Combination and employing our business combination strategy.
 
We anticipate that these various networks will provide our management team with a number of potential transaction candidates. Additionally, we anticipate numerous candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources such as private equity/venture capital firms and the broader investment banking community. Upon completion of our public offering, our management team has proactively communicated with its network of relationships our desire to identify potential target companies that complement our competitive strengths and fall withing our general investment criteria.
 
We may pursue an initial Business Combination in any business or industry but expect to focus on a target in an industry where we believe our management team and founder’s expertise will provide us with a competitive advantage. Given the experience and network of our management team, we may decide to focus on consumer-focused enterprises, including e-commerce, on the renewables and energy services sector, and/or on the insurance and financial services sector.

Consumer-Focused Enterprises, including E-Commerce
 
We believe the market opportunity for consumer-focused enterprises, including e-commerce, is poised for continued growth through 2030, despite record growth experienced through the last two decades and the acceleration of this growth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, personal consumption expenditures accounted for nearly 70% of total U.S. Gross Domestic Product.
 
Growth and strategic opportunities span the following industries:
 

• | Vertical e-commerce;
--+---------------------


• | Promotions and experiences; and
--+--------------------------------


• | Other markets, including but not limited to, the e-commerce enablement software and diversified e-commerce markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
E-commerce end-markets are driving significant disruption while experiencing the emergence of a wide variety of secular trends, including:
 

• | An increase in retail penetration and importance of e-commerce to traditional brick and mortar retailers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved customer comfort with transacting online, resulting in higher average order value and increased order frequency;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A shift to omnichannel retail;
--+-------------------------------


• | A proliferation of direct-to-consumer brands that come to market quickly;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An increase in the use of augmented and virtual reality in the shopping experience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A shift to product subscription models; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | A large portion of value-conscious customers who are still underserved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Global supply chains have been disrupted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the shift to e-commerce. We expect this trend will continue after a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Renewables and Energy Services
 
We believe the energy and power sectors face unprecedented challenges in the coming years. With the backdrop of historic environmental challenges and sweeping industry structural change, the world’s demand for the reliable supply of energy continues to expand. While much of the existing energy and power infrastructure is aging, industry participants must keep up with the need for additional capacity, increased reliability, improved power/fuel quality, and lower environmental impact. We intend to focus our search for a target business in the energy technology arena targeting industries that require sustainable and innovative solutions to decarbonize in order to meet critical emission reduction objectives, including in the renewable energy, energy storage, mobility, advanced fuels, and carbon mitigation sectors. We believe that the next ten years will be a period of significant transformation in the energy industry as cultural preferences and regulatory edicts drive decarbonization and sustainability goals. Two ramifications of these trends will be (1) a continuing shift away from carbon intensive forms of electricity generation towards more renewable, carbon neutral generation capacity and (2) increased demand for electricity due to electrification of transportation, HVAC and other energy end uses. These trends will have potentially destabilizing impacts on the current transmission and distribution of electricity, a system which was set up to deliver dispatchable power. The anticipated increased burden and complexity of the distribution system will continue to generate significant opportunity for enhanced management of energy transportation and distribution systems to more effectively and responsibly meet demand. We believe that these challenges and dislocations will create attractive investment opportunities that we will look to take advantage of.
 
Within the energy industry, we intend to focus our efforts on the following segments:
 

• | Renewables: As sustained structural shifts in U.S. power generation continue, solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and biofuels have attracted significant investment from many investors and operators. Continued growth in renewables and the equipment and technology providers enabling more efficient energy production, transportation and end-use applications is expected to incubate an attractive set of investment opportunities; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Table  of Contents

• | Energy Services Businesses: Services to the energy industry, such as energy transportation and logistics, and specialized services such as geophysical, completion services, drilling fluids, rentals, artificial lift, environmental services, specialty chemicals, seismic and water handling services. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance and Financial Services
 
Our large network of senior executives and presence across the banking and financial services sectors affords us leverageable insight into the strategic objectives and challenges the industry’s business leaders face, as well as the companies providing innovative technology solutions and services in response. This differentiated perspective has helped shape our investment themes, which are focused on two areas:

• | Insurance Technology and Insurance Services: business models with unique products and/or customer acquisition strategies, including but not limited to business with specialized product design focused on regulatory capital arbitrage, with rollup opportunities among niche brokerage and agencies; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial Services: companies with durable business models, including service providers and technology companies that benefit from regulatory changes or systemic shifts in consumer or commercial preferences. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
 
Management possesses a strong set of business strengths that uniquely positions them to successfully identify and acquire a target company. These capabilities are more particularly described below:

• | Significant experience. Our principals have broad and deep business and investing experience which includes extensive investing in public and private equity, leading large businesses and serving on multiple public and private company boards. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deep relationships. Management has a wide network of contacts ranging from large family-owned businesses to private equity firms as well as relationships with a myriad of directors and CEOs of successful public companies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Thorough due diligence. Management has substantial experience in managing a due diligence process that emphasizes identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats as well as determining the appropriate valuation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Skilled execution. Management has significant experience in sophisticated transaction construction that optimizes the capital structure of the business in order to achieve desired operating performance. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria
 
As discussed above, we believe our management team’s extensive network and detailed understanding of the mechanics of a variety of industries will enable both flexible identification and a thorough vetting of target businesses. We will look to identify businesses with the following characteristics; this list is not exhaustive and target companies may include all, some, or none of these criteria:

• | Growth potential. Are well-positioned for top line and margin growth achieved both organically as well as from potential strategic acquisitions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive advantage. Possess a solid market share in their industry and continually focus on strengthening their competitive advantages.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Table  of Contents

• | Strong Management Teams. Have a set of capable, experienced and ethical managers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commitment to maximizing shareholder value as a publicly traded company. Have a clearly articulated strategy, effective operations, a strong culture, and a commitment to maximizing value while operating a strong governance framework. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire. However, our management team’s network of contacts, and its investing and operating experience, do not guarantee a successful initial Business Combination. The members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are involved with other businesses. We cannot guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any other role, after our initial Business Combination, and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until we complete our initial Business Combination. Past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “Investment Company Act”. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
 In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 


  Table  of Contents
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our initial Business Combination
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination.
 
We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing deferred underwriting commissions and interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account initially will be $10.00 per public share. There will be no redemption rights upon the consummation of our initial Business Combination with respect to our warrants. The initial holders, and our officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, (i) in connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering and (iii) if we fail to consummate a business combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering or if we liquidate prior to the expiration of the 18-month period. The initial holders and our directors and officers have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to public shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination and in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the 18-month period. However, the initial holders, our officers and directors will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares held by them if we fail to consummate a business combination or liquidate within the 18-month period. The anchor investors will not be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by them, in connection with the completion of our business combination.
 
Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
  Table  of Contents
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination either in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement.
 
We currently intend to conduct redemptions pursuant to a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 
 
• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Upon the public announcement of our initial Business Combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules), or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial Business Combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial Business Combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our Nasdaq listing or Exchange Act registration.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them, and the anchor investors have agreed to vote any founder shares held by them, in favor of our initial Business Combination. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our initial Business Combination, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 25.0% of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon (excluding the shares underlying the private placement warrants). As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares, we would need 9,375,001, or 37.5%, of the 25,000,000 public shares sold in our public offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted and the option to purchase additional units is not exercised) in order to have such initial Business Combination approved. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders and anchor investors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial Business Combination and, in any event, the terms of the proposed business combination may require our net tangible assets to be greater than $5,000,001. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. If the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly tendered plus the amount of any cash payments required pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceeds the aggregate amount of cash available to us, taking into consideration the requirement that we maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 or such greater amount depending on the terms of our potential business combination, we will not consummate the business combination and any shares of common stock tendered pursuant to the tender offer will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer.
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to an aggregate of 20.0% or more of the shares sold in our public offering without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 20.0% of the shares sold in our public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 20.0% of the shares sold in our public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
 
However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 20.0% of the shares sold in our public offering) for or against our initial Business Combination.
 
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve our initial Business Combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, rather than simply voting against the initial Business Combination. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.
  Table  of Contents
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivers its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of a business combination.
 
If the initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate a business combination with a different target until 18 months from the completion of our public offering.
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no initial Business Combination
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we have only 18 months from the completion of our public offering to consummate our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial Business Combination within the 18-month period, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up our affairs. If we have not consummated a business combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes and up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial Business Combination within such completion window.
 


  Table  of Contents
The initial holders, our officers and directors have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, (i) in connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering and (iii) if we fail to consummate a business combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering or if we liquidate prior to the expiration of the 18-month period. The initial holders and our officers and directors have also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to public shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination and in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within the 18-month period. However, the initial holders and our officers and directors will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any public shares held by them if we fail to consummate a business combination within the 18-month period.
 
The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account if we do not consummate a business combination and subsequently liquidate and, in such event, the deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares.
 
Our initial stockholders, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
We will pay the costs of any liquidation from the net proceeds from our public offering and the private placement held out of trust, and up to $100,000 of the interest income on the trust account (net of any taxes payable) which may be released to us, and the balance of loans from our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their respective affiliates or other third parties for working capital purposes and to pay expenses to identify an acquisition target and consummate initial Business Combination, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purposes. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to pay the balance of liquidation expenses and has agreed not to seek repayment for such amounts.
 
The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be less than the $10.00 per public share initially on deposit in the trust account. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.



  Table  of Contents
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. If we do not obtain a waiver from a third party, we will obtain the written consent of our sponsor before our entering into an agreement with such third party. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver and where our sponsor executes a written consent. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, pursuant to a written agreement, our sponsor has agreed that he will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.00 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that our sponsor will be able to satisfy those obligations.
 
If the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in a particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.
 
We will have access to the net proceeds from our public offering and the private placement held out of trust, any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes and up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation). If we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 


Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not consummate our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we have not consummated a business combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering, or earlier at the discretion of our board, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem all public shares then outstanding at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account, less any interest released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes and up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 


  Table  of Contents
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
As a result of this obligation and our Sponsor’s indemnification of the trust account against certain claims as previously described in this section, we believe that the claims that could be made against us will be significantly limited and that the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per public share, and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.
 
We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate a business combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 18 months from the completion of our public offering or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination. Also, our management may cease to pursue a business combination prior to the expiration of the 18-month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination). In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial Business Combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial Business Combination. In addition, the number of our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination.
Employees
 
We currently have three (3) executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination.
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team have not been subject to any such proceeding in the 12 months preceding the date of this Report.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such Business Combination. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial Business Combination.
 


  Table  of Contents
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
