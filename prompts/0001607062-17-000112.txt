ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
Headquartered in Jersey City, New Jersey, the Company engages in new product development, production, marketing, distribution and sales of beverage brands that are natural, USDA Organic and Non GMO Project Verified.
CURRENT OPERATIONS
 
Sales and Distribution
 
The Company began selling MOJO Naturals Pure Coconut Water in December 2015. In addition to Pure Coconut Water, the Company produces Coconut Water + Peach Mango Juice and Coconut Water + Pineapple Juice. We seek to grow the market share of our products by expanding our distribution network through the relationships and efforts of our management and third party distribution relationships.
Production 
 
The Company has multiple sources for its products.  The Company’s fruit sources are of high quality and are part of the overall taste and quality of its products. The Company’s current arrangements for production and packaging exceed required levels.
Competition
 
The beverage industry is competitive.  Competitors in our market compete for brand recognition, ingredient sourcing, qualified personnel and product shelf space.  Our competitors have similar distribution channels and retailers to deliver and sell their products.   
Government Regulation
 
Within the United States, beverages are governed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”).  As such, it is necessary for the Company to establish, maintain and make available for inspection records as well as to develop labels (including nutrition information) that meet legal food labeling requirements.  The Company’s production facilities are subject to FDA regulation.
Employees
 
As of March 23, 2017, the Company had three employees.  The Company also uses the services of contractors, consultants and other third-parties. We contract with food brokers to represent our products to retail stores, and in certain regions of the United States, we utilize the services of direct sales and distribution companies that sell our products to their customers. This alleviates the need for a large sales and merchandising force.  We use third-party manufacturing facilities to produce our products and we outsource the storage and transportation of our products.
CORPORATE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
 
On January 20, 2016, the Company approved a subscription agreement (the “2016 Subscription”) whereby shares of the Company’s common stock, $0.001 par value (“Common Stock”) were offered to accredited investors for $0.35 per share. For every two shares purchased, the investor received a warrant to acquire one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share exercisable for a period of two years from the date of issuance. The Company issued a total of 964,286 shares of Common Stock and two year purchase warrants to acquire a total of 482,143 shares of Common Stock to four accredited investors for consideration of $337,500.
