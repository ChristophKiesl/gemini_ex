Smaller Reporting Company Status
 
We also qualify as a “smaller reporting company” under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as, among other possible qualifications, a company with a public equity float of less than $250 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
