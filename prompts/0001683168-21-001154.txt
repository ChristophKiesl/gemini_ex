Plan of Operation
 
Mobiquity plans to hire several new sales and sales support individuals to help generate additional revenue through the use of the Advangelists platform. Mobiquity’s sales team focuses on Advertising Agencies, Brands and publishers to help increase both supply and demand across the Advangelists platform. The Advangelists platform creates three revenue streams for Mobiquity. The first is licensing the Advangelists platform as a white-label product for use by Advertising Agencies, DSP’s, Brands and Publishers. Under the White-Label scenario, the user licenses the technology and is responsible for running its own business operations and is billed a percentage of volume run through the platform. The second revenue stream is a managed services model, in which, the user is billed a higher percentage of revenue run through the platform, but all services are managed by the Mobiquity/Advangelists team. The third revenue model is a seat model, whereas the user is billed a percentage of revenue run through the platform and business operations are shared between the user and the Mobiquity/Advangelists team. The goal of the sales team is to inform potential users of the benefits in efficiency and effectiveness of utilizing the end-to-end, fully integrated ATOS created by Advangelists.
Intellectual Property
 
Advangelists' technology is proprietary and has all been developed internally. We own our technology and protect it though trade secrets and each employee signing an agreement agreeing to keep the proprietary information confidential and assigning any improvements to the technology to Advangelists.

Mobiquity Networks derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above. All the products used to derive revenue for the Company are reliant on the collection or use of data. To achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward, we have developed a strategy to increase the number of devices we see by increasing our direct relationships with publishers. To continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis, we need to increase our partnerships. We believe our unique offering to potential partners gives us a competitive advantage over others in the industry. The task of partnering to increase the number of devices we see is handled internally by our business development team.
 
In 2020, we had approximately 6,000,000 Places in our proprietary Places database. We have been able to steadily increase the number of locations available in our Places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies. The task of growing our Places database is handled by our internal technology team. The Company currently utilizes both internal and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings.
