 Overview
 Riviera is an independent oil and natural gas company with a strategic focus on efficiently operating its mature low-decline assets, developing its growth-oriented assets, and returning capital to shareholders.  Riviera is quoted for trading on the OTCQX Market under the ticker “RVRA.”  The Company has two operating segments: upstream and Blue Mountain.
 The Company’s upstream reporting segment properties are currently primarily located in two operating regions in the United States (“U.S.”): the Mid-Continent and North Louisiana.  Proved reserves at December 31, 2019, were approximately 316 Bcfe, of which approximately 89% were natural gas, 6% were natural gas liquids (“NGL”) and 5% were oil.  Approximately 90% were classified as proved developed, with a total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of approximately $159 million.  At December 31, 2019, the Company operated 1,446 or approximately 55% of its 2,635 gross productive wells.
 In the first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the sale of its interests in non-operated properties located in the Drunkards Wash field in the Uinta Basin, the Overton field in East Texas and the Personville field in East Texas.  These properties are included in “assets held for sale” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.  Reserve information as of December 31, 2019, includes amounts associated with these properties.  See Note 4 for additional information.
 The Blue Mountain reporting segment consists of a state of the art cryogenic natural gas processing facility, a network of gathering pipelines and compressors and produced water services and a crude oil gathering system located in the Merge/SCOOP/STACK play, each of which is owned by Blue Mountain Midstream LLC (“Blue Mountain Midstream”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 In April 2018, the Parent announced its intention to separate Riviera from LINN Energy.  To effect the separation, the Parent and certain of its then direct and indirect subsidiaries undertook an internal reorganization (including the conversion of Riviera Resources, LLC from a limited liability company to a corporation named Riviera Resources, Inc.), following which Riviera holds, directly or through its subsidiaries, substantially all of the assets of LINN Energy, other than LINN Energy’s 50% equity interest in Roan Resources LLC (“Roan”).  A subsidiary of the Company held the equity interest in Roan until the Parent’s internal reorganization on July 25, 2018 (the “Reorganization Date”).  Following the internal reorganization, the Parent distributed all of the outstanding shares of Riviera common stock to the Parent’s shareholders on a pro rata basis (the “Spin-off”).  The Spin-off was completed on August 7, 2018.

Item 1.Business - Continued
 Prior to the Spin-off, the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements were prepared on a stand-alone basis and derived from the Parent’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records for the periods presented as the Company was historically managed as a subsidiary of the Parent.
 Historically, a subsidiary of the Company also owned a 50% equity interest in Roan.  The Company’s equity earnings (losses), consisting of its share of Roan’s earnings or losses, are included in the consolidated and combined financial statements through the Reorganization Date.  However, on the Reorganization Date, the equity interest in Roan was distributed to the Parent and is no longer affiliated with Riviera.  As such, the Company has classified the investment and equity earnings (losses) in Roan as discontinued operations on its consolidated and combined financial statements.  See Note 4 for additional information.  In December 2019, stockholders of Roan Resources, Inc. approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger”) between Roan Resources, Inc. and a subsidiary of Citizen Energy Operating, LLC (“Citizen Operating”) under which Roan Resources, Inc., including its subsidiary Roan Resources LLC, became wholly owned subsidiaries of Citizen Operating.  The effective date of the Merger was December 6, 2019, and as a result of the Merger, the Company and Roan Resources, Inc. no longer share certain mutual directors and significant stockholders.
 Strategy
 Riviera is strategically focused on efficiently operating its mature low-decline assets, developing its growth-oriented assets, and returning capital to shareholders.  The Company has producing properties currently located primarily in Oklahoma and Louisiana.  The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Blue Mountain Midstream, is an emerging midstream company with assets in central Oklahoma focused on providing its customers with comprehensive natural gas, oil, natural gas liquids, and water solutions in a safe and environmentally sound manner, including gas and oil gathering and processing, water gathering and treatment, and delivery of product to lucrative downstream markets.  In the future, Blue Mountain Midstream looks to expand the scale and scope of its service capabilities in the Merge/SCOOP/STACK through organic growth and strategic acquisitions.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | North Louisiana, which includes oil and natural gas properties producing primarily from the Hosston, Cotton Valley Bossier and Smackover formations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the sale of its interests in non-operated properties located in the Drunkards Wash field in the Uinta Basin, the Overton field in East Texas and the Personville field in East Texas.  These properties are included in “assets held for sale” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.  Reserve information as of December 31, 2019, includes amounts associated with these properties.  See Note 4 for details of the Company’s divestitures.
 During 2019, the Company divested all of its properties located in the Hugoton Basin and Michigan/Illinois operating regions.  During 2018, the Company divested all of its properties located in the Permian Basin operating region.  During 2017, the Company divested all of its properties located in the California and South Texas operating regions.  As a result of the Company’s strategic exit from California in 2017 (completed by the sale of its interest in properties located in the San Joaquin Basin and the Los Angeles Basin in California), the Company classified the results of operations and cash flows of its California properties as discontinued operations on its consolidated and combined financial statements.
 East Texas
 At December 31, 2019, the East Texas region consisted of properties located in east Texas primarily producing natural gas from the Travis Peak, Cotton Valley and Bossier formations at depths ranging from 7,000 feet to 12,500 feet.  The Company’s properties in this region are primarily mature, low-decline natural gas wells.  To more efficiently transport its natural gas in east Texas to market, the Company owns and operates a network of natural gas gathering systems comprised of approximately 590 miles of pipeline and associated compression and metering facilities that connect to numerous sales outlets in the area.
 East Texas proved reserves represented approximately 40% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2019, all of which were classified as proved developed.  This region produced approximately 42 MMcfe/d of the Company’s 2019 average daily production.  During 2019, the Company invested approximately $1 million to develop the properties in this region.  As noted above, the majority of the Company’s properties located in East Texas are included in “assets held for sale” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
 Mid-Continent
 The Mid-Continent region consists of properties located in the Northwest STACK, as well as other Oklahoma properties.  The Company’s properties in this diverse region produce from both oil and natural gas reservoirs at depths ranging from 3,500 feet to 19,000 feet.
 Mid-Continent proved reserves represented approximately 22% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2019, all of which were classified as proved developed.  This region produced approximately 36 MMcfe/d of the Company’s 2019 average daily production.  During 2019, the Company invested approximately $9 million to develop the properties in this region and approximately $43 million in exploration activity.
 North Louisiana
 The North Louisiana region consists of properties located in north Louisiana and primarily producing natural gas from the Hosston, Cotton Valley, Bossier and Smackover formations at depths ranging from 7,000 feet to 12,500 feet.
 North Louisiana proved reserves represented approximately 25% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2019, of which 61% were classified as proved developed.  This region produced approximately 31 MMcfe/d of the Company’s 2019 average daily production.  During 2019, the Company invested approximately $10 million to develop the properties in this region.

Item 1.Business - Continued
 Uinta Basin
 Uinta Basin proved reserves represented approximately 13% of total proved reserves at December 31, 2019, all of which were classified as proved developed.  The Uinta Basin region produced approximately 18 MMcfe/d of the Company’s 2019 average daily production.  During 2019, the Company invested approximately $1 million to develop the properties in the Uinta Basin region.  As noted above, these properties are included in “assets held for sale” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
Blue Mountain Segment
 Blue Mountain Midstream currently provides natural gas and oil gathering, compression and processing and produced water services to producers in the Merge/SCOOP/Stack play in the Mid-Continent Region of Oklahoma.  Blue Mountain Midstream’s assets primarily consist of the state of the art 250 MMcf/d design-capacity Cryo 1 natural gas plant as well as a network of natural gas gathering pipelines and compressors and produced water services (collectively, the “Blue Mountain System”).  Blue Mountain Midstream’s gathering and processing agreements for its gathering and processing system include long-term, fee-based or percent of proceeds contracts.  Based on Blue Mountain Midstream’s contracts, it gathers natural gas and NGLs from producers that it then processes and delivers to third party customers.
 Blue Mountain Midstream is aggressively pursuing growth to its midstream business primarily in Oklahoma.  Additions to the Blue Mountain System are continually underway adding low and high-pressure gathering pipelines and interconnections that will accommodate incremental volume throughput.  During 2019, Blue Mountain Midstream invested approximately $102 million for plant and pipeline construction activities primarily associated with the Blue Mountain System.

There were no lateral segments added to existing vertical wellbores during the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, or December 31, 2017.  As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 14 gross (no net) wells in progress, and no wells were temporarily suspended.
 This information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and the quantities or economic value of reserves found.  Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of oil, natural gas or NGL, regardless of whether they generate a reasonable rate of return.
 Productive Wells
 The following table sets forth information relating to the productive wells in which the Company owned a working interest as of December 31, 2019.  Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Future Acreage Expirations
 The Company’s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage comprises numerous leases.  The terms and conditions under which the Company maintains exploration or production rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property.  If production is not established or the Company takes no other action to extend the terms of the related leases, undeveloped acreage will expire.  The Company currently has no material undeveloped acreage due to expire during the next three years.
 Programs are designed to ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration.  In some instances, the Company may elect to relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business basis for extension.  In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Company has generally been successful in obtaining extensions.  The Company utilizes various methods to manage the expiration of leases, including drilling the acreage prior to lease expiration or extending lease terms.
 Production, Price and Cost History
 The Company’s natural gas production is primarily sold under short-term, market-sensitive contracts that are typically priced at the published natural gas index for the producing area plus or minus a differential attributable to the natural gas quality and the proximity to major consuming markets.  In certain circumstances, the Company has entered into natural gas processing contracts whereby the residue natural gas is sold under short-term contracts but the related NGL are sold under long-term contracts.  In all such cases, the residue natural gas and NGL are sold at market-sensitive index prices.  As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no natural gas or NGL delivery commitments under long-term contracts.
 The Company’s natural gas production is sold to purchasers under spot price contracts, percentage-of-index contracts or percentage-of-proceeds contracts.  Under percentage-of-index contracts, the Company receives a percentage of the published index price for the producing area for its residue natural gas and NGL.  Under percentage-of-proceeds contracts, the Company receives a percentage of the resale price received by the purchaser for sales of residue natural gas and NGL 
 7

Item 1.Business - Continued
 recovered after transportation and processing of natural gas.  These purchasers sell the residue natural gas and NGL based primarily on spot market prices.
 The Company’s natural gas is transported through its own and third-party gathering systems and pipelines.  The Company incurs processing, gathering and transportation expenses to move its natural gas from the wellhead to a purchaser-specified delivery point.  These expenses vary based on the volume, distance shipped and the fee charged by the third-party processor or transporter.
 The Company’s oil production is primarily sold under short-term, market-sensitive contracts that are typically priced at a differential to the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) price or at purchaser-posted prices for the producing area.  As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no oil delivery commitments under long-term contracts.

----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations, reserves were estimated using the average price during the 12-month period, determined as an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. The average price used to estimate reserves is held constant over the life of the reserves. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s PUDs decreased to 32 Bcfe from 65 Bcfe at December 31, 2018, representing a decrease of approximately 33 Bcfe.  The decrease was primarily due to divestitures.  Reserves classified as PUDs at December 31, 2018, that were converted to proved developed reserves during the year ended December 31, 2019, were not material.
 Based on the December 31, 2019, reserve reports, the amounts of capital expenditures estimated to be incurred in 2020, 2021 and 2022 to develop the Company’s PUDs are approximately $5 million, $5 million and $5 million, respectively.  The amount and timing of these expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including actual drilling results, service costs and product prices.  None of the 32 Bcfe of PUDs at December 31, 2019, has remained undeveloped for five years or more.  All PUD properties are included in the Company’s current five-year development plan.
 Reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL that cannot be measured exactly.  The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.  Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL that are ultimately recovered.  Future prices received for production may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices assumed for the purposes of estimating the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows should not be construed as the market value of the reserves at the dates shown.  The 10% discount factor required to be used under the provisions of applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and natural gas industry.  The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is materially affected by assumptions regarding the timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
 The reserve estimates reported herein were prepared by independent engineers, DeGolyer and MacNaughton.  The process performed by the independent engineers to prepare reserve amounts included their estimation of reserve quantities, future production rates, future net revenue and the present value of such future net revenue, based in part on data provided by the Company.  When preparing the reserve estimates, the independent engineering firm did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the information and data furnished by the Company with respect to ownership interests, production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production.  However, if in the course of their work, something came to their 
 10

Item 1.Business - Continued
 attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, they did not rely on such information or data until they had satisfactorily resolved their questions relating thereto.  The estimates of reserves conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years.  The independent engineering firm also prepared estimates with respect to reserve categorization, using the definitions of proved reserves set forth in Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) and subsequent SEC staff interpretations and guidance.
 The Company’s internal control over the preparation of reserve estimates is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s reserve estimates in accordance with SEC regulations.  The preparation of reserve estimates was overseen by the Company’s Director of Reserves and Business Development who has a Master of Petroleum Engineering degree and 10 years of oil and natural gas industry experience.  The reserve estimates were reviewed and approved by the Company’s senior engineering staff and management, with final approval by its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  For additional information regarding estimates of reserves, including the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see “Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Data (Unaudited)” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  The Company has not filed reserve estimates with any federal authority or agency, with the exception of the SEC.
 Operational Overview
 General
 The Company generally seeks to be the operator of its properties so that it can develop drilling programs and optimization projects intended to not only replace production, but also to add value through reserve and production growth and future operational synergies.  Many of the Company’s wells are completed in multiple producing zones with commingled production and long economic lives.
Principal Customers
 For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to ONEOK Hydrocarbon, L.P. accounted for approximately 19% of the Company’s total revenues.  If the Company were to lose any one of its major oil and natural gas purchasers, the loss could temporarily cease or delay production and sale of its oil and natural gas in that particular purchaser’s service area.  If the Company were to lose a purchaser, it believes it could identify a substitute purchaser.  However, if one or more of the large purchasers ceased purchasing oil and natural gas altogether, it could have a detrimental effect on the oil and natural gas market in general and on the prices and volumes of oil, natural gas and NGL that the Company is able to sell.
Competition
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.  The Company encounters strong competition from other independent operators in contracting for drilling and other related services, as well as hiring trained personnel.  The Company is also affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment.  In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and has caused significant price increases.  The Company is unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect its drilling program.
Operating Hazards and Insurance
 The oil and natural gas industry involves a variety of operating hazards and risks that could result in substantial losses from, among other things, injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, cleanup responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations.  The Company may be strictly liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property it purchases and leases.  As a result, the Company may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities, the payment of which could reduce or eliminate funds otherwise available, or result in the loss of properties.  In addition, the Company participates in wells on a non-operated basis, and therefore may be limited in its ability to control the risks associated with the operation of such wells.
 11

Item 1.Business - Continued
 In accordance with customary industry practices, the Company maintains insurance against some, but not all, potential losses.  The Company cannot provide assurance that any insurance it obtains will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities.  The Company has elected to self-insure for certain items for which it has determined that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented.  In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.  The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  For more information about potential risks that could affect the Company, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Title to Properties
 Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, the Company conducts a title examination and performs curative work with respect to significant defects.  To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, the Company is typically responsible for curing any title defects at its expense prior to commencing drilling operations.  Prior to completing an acquisition of producing leases, the Company performs title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, the Company may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions.  As a result, the Company has obtained title opinions on a significant portion of its properties and believes that it has satisfactory title to its producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
 Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit the drilling and producing activities and other operations in regions of the U.S. in which the Company operates.  These seasonal conditions can pose challenges for meeting the well drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations.  For example, the Company’s operations may be impacted by ice and snow in the winter and by electrical storms and high temperatures in the spring and summer, as well as by wild fires in the fall.
 The demand for natural gas typically decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months.  Seasonal anomalies sometimes lessen this fluctuation.  In addition, certain natural gas consumers utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.
 Environmental Matters and Regulation
 The Company’s operations are subject to the same stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection as other companies in the oil and natural gas industry.  These laws and regulations may:

• | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands, areas inhabited by endangered species and other protected areas;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require remedial measures to prevent pollution from former operations, such as pit closure, reclamation and plugging and abandonment of wells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require, with little to no notice, the cessation of fluid disposal operations into disposal wells owned or controlled by the Company, or other disposal wells that the Company utilizes, which could in turn cause an unexpected, significant increase in the price to dispose of such fluids and/or cause the Company to shut in proximate producing wells while awaiting disposal capacity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement with respect to operations affecting federal lands or leases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These laws and regulations may also restrict the production rate of oil, natural gas and NGL below the rate that would otherwise be possible.  The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects 
 12

Item 1.Business - Continued
 profitability.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary fines or penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations.  Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of the Company’s operations, which may result in significant costs and liabilities, including third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons.  Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on operating costs.
 The environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its operations include, among others, the following U.S. federal laws and regulations:
  
• | Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | Clean Water Act (“CWA”), which governs discharges to and excavations within the waters of the U.S.;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability where hazardous releases have occurred or are threatened to occur (commonly known as “Superfund”);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which amends and augments the CWA and imposes certain duties and liabilities related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which prescribes new fuel economy standards and other energy saving measures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to consider the potential environmental effects of federal actions, including oil and natural gas production activities on federal lands;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which governs the management of solid waste;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), which governs the underground injection and disposal of wastewater;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), which restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | U.S. Department of Interior regulations, which impose liability for pollution cleanup and damages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil, natural gas and NGL, including imposing production taxes and requiring drilling permits.  States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of resources.  States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both.  For example, there is currently pending before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission a proposal to reduce the statewide proration formula for unallocated gas wells that, alone or together in a single unit, have a flow rate of 2,000 mcf per day or greater.  If this proposal is approved, it could reduce the volumes of natural gas that our upstream segment is entitled to recover and reduce the volumes flowing to Blue Mountain’s gathering and processing system from producer customers. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulations, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future.  The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil, natural gas and NGL that may be produced from the Company’s wells and to limit the number of wells or locations it can drill.  The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws, including those related to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal opportunity employment.
 The Company believes that it substantially complies with all current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.  Future regulatory issues that could impact the Company or its operations include new rules or legislation relating to the items discussed below.
 Climate Change
 In December 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes.  Based on these findings, the EPA adopted and implemented regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act, but the future of these regulations is not clear.  For example, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules that set additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and established new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities.  The rules included first-time standards to address 
 13

Item 1.Business - Continued
 emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions.  However, in September 201, under a new administration, the EPA proposed to remove transmission and storage activities from the purview of the rules, thereby rescinding the VOC and methane emissions limits applicable to those activities. The proposed rule would also rescind the methane limit emissions for production and processing sources, but would maintain emissions limits for VOCs. In the alternative, the EPA also proposed to simply rescind the methane requirements for all oil and natural gas sources, without removing any activities from the source category.  A lawsuit filed in April 2018 by a coalition of states in federal district court aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector is pending (as of October 2019, the EPA had requested a stay of the litigation pending the outcome of its proposed overhaul of the 2016 methane requirements).  The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the U.S., including certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis.
 On an international level, the U.S. was one of 175 countries to sign an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that requires member countries to set their own GHG emission reduction goals beginning in 2020 (the “Paris Agreement”).  However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and on November 4, 2019, the U.S. submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations.  The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification, although there is a possibility that a new administration could choose to rejoin the Paris Agreement.  Certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement.  In addition, legislation has from time to time been introduced in Congress that would establish measures restricting GHG emissions in the U.S., and a number of states, various corporations, and numerous investors have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce emissions of GHGs.  Any such additional regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.
 Any legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas the Company produces.  Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.  Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas the Company produces.  In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital, restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities.  Finally, most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events.  If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced or cause the Company to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations.  The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  The Company performs hydraulic fracturing as part of its operations.  Hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and natural gas regulatory programs.  However, in February 2014, the EPA published permitting guidance under the SDWA addressing the use of diesel in fracturing hydraulic operations, and in May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and natural gas exploration or production.  Further, in March 2015, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) adopted a rule requiring, among other things, public disclosure to the BLM of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations after fracturing operations have been completed and strengthening standards for well-bore integrity and management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands.  Following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017; however, that rescission has been challenged by several environmental groups and states in ongoing litigation (oral arguments were heard in the case in January 2020 after a long hiatus).  In addition, from time to time legislation has been introduced before Congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and would require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.  If enacted, these or similar laws or regulations could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those 
 14

Item 1.Business - Continued
 operations.  These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites and also increased costs to make wells productive.
 There may be other attempts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA, TSCA and/or other statutory or regulatory mechanisms.  In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.  Moreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other states and local governments are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances.  For example, many states in which the Company operates have adopted disclosure regulations requiring varying degrees of disclosure of the constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids.  In addition, the regulation or prohibition of hydraulic fracturing is the subject of significant political activity in a number of jurisdictions, some of which have resulted in tighter regulation, bans, and/or recognition of local government authority to implement such restrictions.  In many instances, litigation has ensued, some of which remains pending.  If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for the Company to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations.  In addition, any such additional regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the Company’s revenues, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.
 Hydraulic fracturing operations require the use of a significant amount of water.  The Company’s inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in its drilling and production operations, could adversely impact its operations.  Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the development or production of natural gas.
 The Company disposes of wastewater generated from oil and natural gas production operations, including hydraulic fracturing operations, directly or through the use of third parties.  In some instances, the operation of underground injection or large volume disposal wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes in some of the states where the Company operates.  Such issues have sometimes led to orders prohibiting continued injection or disposal or the suspension of drilling in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity.  Such concerns also have resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells.  For example, Oklahoma issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions, required additional seismicity protocols in certain defined areas, and from time to time, directs certain injection wells in proximity to seismic events to restrict or suspend operations.  Future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection or water disposal could affect the Company, either directly or indirectly, depending on the wells affected, which materially affect its capital expenditures and operating costs.
 Solid and Hazardous Waste
 Although oil and natural gas wastes generally are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA and some comparable state statutes, it is possible some wastes the Company generates presently or in the future may be subject to regulation under RCRA or other applicable statutes.  The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal options for certain wastes, including hazardous wastes, and there is no guarantee that the EPA or the states will not adopt more stringent requirements in the future.  For example, in December 2016, the EPA and several environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA.  The consent decree required the EPA to propose a rulemaking for revision of certain regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary, and in April of 2019 the EPA made the determination that revisions to the regulations were not necessary at that time, concluding that any adverse effects related to oil and gas waste were more appropriately and readily addressed within the framework of existing state regulatory programs.  Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the Company’s oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from designation as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
 In addition, CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes cleanup obligations, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release 
 15

Item 1.Business - Continued
 occurred and companies that transported or disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA and any state analogs may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file corresponding common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  While petroleum and crude oil fractions are not included in the definition of hazardous substances under CERCLA and some of its state analogs because of the so-called “petroleum exclusion,” adulterated petroleum products containing other hazardous substances have been treated as hazardous substances under CERCLA in the past.
Endangered Species Act
 Some of the Company’s operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species under the ESA.  In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species.  A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development.  Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary, including for over 250 species as required under a 2011 settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and many hundreds of additional anticipated listing decisions have already been identified beyond those recognized in the 2011 settlement.  The Company believes that it is currently in substantial compliance with the ESA.  However, the designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, if located in the areas of the Company’s operations, could cause the Company to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist.
Air Emissions
 The New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs under the Clean Air Act impose specific requirements affecting the oil and gas industry under programs for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, completions, and certain other equipment and processes.  Periodic review and revision of these and other rules by federal and state agencies may require changes to the Company’s operations, including possible installation of new equipment to control emissions.  For example, as described above, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane and VOC emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector; however, in September 2019, under a new administration, the EPA published proposed amendments that would rescind the methane standards and roll back other requirements of the rules.  Similarly, in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of regulations it previously enacted to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands; California and New Mexico have challenged the rule in ongoing litigation.  In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending but may be stayed pending the outcome of the EPA’s proposed overhaul of the 2016 rules.  Several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category.  In addition, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry.  This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements.  Further, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion in October 2015.  State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements or delay, or limit the Company’s ability to obtain permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment.  Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase the Company’s costs of development, which costs could be significant.
Water Resources
 The CWA and analogous state laws restrict the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes, into “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”).  Under the CWA, permits must be obtained for the discharge of pollutants into WOTUS.  The CWA provides for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, both routine and accidental, of pollutants and of oil and hazardous substances.  It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances.  State laws governing discharges 
 16

Item 1.Business - Continued
 to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters.  In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require permits to discharge storm water runoff, including discharges associated with construction activities.  The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters including wetlands without a permit.  The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers published a rule to revise the definition of WOTUS for all CWA programs, which went into effect in August 2015, which was stayed nationwide in October 2015 pending several legal challenges to the rule.  In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the rule revising the WOTUS definition must be reviewed first in the federal district courts, which resulted in a withdrawal of the stay by the Sixth Circuit.  In October 2019, the EPA published a final rule repealing the rule revising the WOTUS definition, which became effective on December 23, 2019 and has already been challenged in federal district courts in New Mexico, New York, and South Carolina.  In January 2020, the EPA announced a final rule redefining WOTUS. Several groups have already announced their intentions to challenge this rule as well.  To the extent the repeal and revision rules are successfully challenged or the August 2015 rule is enforced in jurisdictions in which the Company operates or a replacement rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, the Company could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.
 Also, in June 2016, the EPA finalized wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works.  This restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to CWA requirements may result in increased costs.
 Economic Regulation
 Regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil sales, and transportation of natural gas, NGLs, and crude oil may affect certain aspects of the Company’s business and the market for its products and services.
Regulation of Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines
 Blue Mountain Midstream owns and operates the Blue Mountain Delivery Line, which is a natural gas pipeline that extends approximately 10 miles from the Blue Mountain Chisholm Trail Cryogenic Gas Complex to delivery points on the interstate pipelines owned and operated by Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Enable Gas Transmission, LLC.  Blue Mountain Midstream has obtained a limited jurisdiction certificate of public convenience and necessity under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) for the Blue Mountain Delivery Line.  In the certificate order, among other things, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) waived requirements pertaining to the filing of an initial rate for service, the filing of a tariff and compliance with specified FERC accounting and reporting requirements.  As such, the Blue Mountain Delivery Line is not currently subject to conventional FERC rate regulation; to requirements FERC imposes on “open access” interstate natural gas pipelines; to the obligation to file and maintain a tariff; or to the obligation to conform to certain business practices and to file certain reports.  If, however, the Company receives a bona fide request for firm service on the Blue Mountain Delivery Line from a third party, FERC would reexamine the waivers it has granted the Company and would require the Company to file for authorization to offer “open access” transportation under its regulations, which would impose additional costs upon the Company.
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
 The Company’s natural gas gathering operations are typically subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which it operates.  The common purchaser statutes generally require gathering pipelines to purchase or take without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer.  These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another or one source of supply over another.  The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on the Company’s ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to gather natural gas.  The states in which the Company operates have adopted complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination.  The rates the Company charges for gathering are deemed just and reasonable unless challenged in a complaint.  The Company cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against it in the future.  Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
 17

Item 1.Business - Continued
 Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation as a natural gas company by FERC under the NGA.  Although the FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of the Company’s facilities, the Company believes that the natural gas pipelines in its gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company.
Natural Gas Processing
 The Company’s natural gas processing operations are not presently subject to FERC regulation.  There can be no assurance, however, that its processing operations will continue to be exempt from other FERC regulation in the future.
Sales of Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil
 The price at which the Company buys and sells natural gas, NGLs and crude oil is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state rate regulation.  However, with regard to the Company’s physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities and any related hedging activities that it undertakes, it is required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), and/or the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”).  See “−Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting the Company’s Industry−EP Act 2005” and “−Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting the Company’s Industry−Derivatives Regulation.”  Should the Company violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, it could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Other State and Local Regulation of Operations
 The Company’s business activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, community right-to-know, protection of the environment, safety and other matters.
Other Federal Laws and Regulations Affecting the Company’s Industry
 The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EP Act 2005”) is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry.  Among other matters, the EP Act 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority.  The EP Act 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day for violations of the NGA and $1 million per violation per day for violations of the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”), each subject to annual adjustment to account for inflation.  The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce.  In 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act 2005.  Order No. 670 does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent their activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction.
 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts.  The Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to its natural gas operations.  The Company does not believe that it would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other upstream and midstream natural gas companies with whom it competes.
 Pipeline Safety Regulations
 Some of the Company’s pipelines are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (“NGPSA”) with respect to natural gas, and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, (“HLPSA”) with respect to crude oil and NGLs.  Both the NGPSA and the HLPSA have subsequently been amended legislatively and are implemented through regulations promulgated by the PHMSA (collectively, “Pipeline Safety Laws”).  These laws and regulations establish minimum safety requirements in the design, 
 18

Item 1.Business - Continued
 construction, operation and maintenance of certain natural gas, crude oil and NGL pipeline facilities, as well as requirements for inspections and pipeline integrity
 For example, pipeline operators must implement integrity management programs, including frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”), such as:
  
• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve data collection, integration and analysis;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.
--+---------------------------------------------

 The PHMSA has issued rules applying safety regulations to certain rural low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines that were not covered previously by its regulations.  In October 2019, PHMSA finalized rules addressing integrity management requirements and applying new safety regulations to hazardous liquid pipelines, including a requirement that operators inspect affected pipelines following extreme weather events or natural disasters, that all hazardous liquid pipelines have a system for detecting leaks and that pipelines in high consequence areas be capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools within 20 years.  Further regulatory changes have been directed by Congress in other areas where the PHMSA has yet to take final action, notably requirements for certain shut-off valves on transmission lines, mapping all HCAs, and shortening the deadline for accident and incident notifications.
 Violations of the Pipeline Safety Laws are punishable by administrative civil penalties of $218,647 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,186,465 for a series of violations.  The PHMSA may also issue corrective orders to pipeline operators to enforce compliance with the Pipeline Safety Laws.  In 2016, Congress amended the Pipeline Safety Laws to, among other things, grant the PHMSA authority to issue emergency orders requiring owners and operators of regulated pipeline facilities to address imminent hazards without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing, as well as enhanced release reporting requirements.  PHMSA finalized a rulemaking implementing this new authority in October 2019.  In April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking, addressing natural gas transmission and gathering lines, and PHMSA issued a final rule with respect to natural gas transmission lines in October 2019. PHMSA has yet to finalize this rulemaking with respect to gathering lines, although it expects to do so later in 2020. With respect to transmission pipelines, the final rule changes integrity management requirements, expands assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in “moderate-consequence areas,” including areas of medium population density, and increases requirements for monitoring and inspection of pipeline segments not located in HCAs.  The final rule also requires that records or other data relied on to determine operating pressures must be traceable, verifiable and complete.  If the pending gathering pipeline portion of the rulemaking leads to a final rule that applies similar requirements to our gathering lines, then locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities, could significantly increase the Company’s costs.  Failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could also result in the reduction of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on the Company’s pipelines.  As PHMSA has yet to finalize this rulemaking as applied to gathering lines, however, the contents and timing of any final rule, as well as their effects on the Company, are uncertain.
 The federal Pipeline Safety Laws largely preempt state regulation of pipeline safety for interstate lines but most states are certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines.  States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety.  State standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines.  The Company does not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations.
 The Company’s natural gas pipelines have inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.  The Company regularly reviews all existing and proposed pipeline safety requirements and works to incorporate the new requirements into procedures and budgets.  The Company expects to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations.  Costs may also be incurred if there were an accidental release of a commodity transported by the Company’s system, or if a regulatory inspection identified a deficiency in the Company’s required programs.

Item 1.Business - Continued
 Worker Safety
 The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and analogous state laws regulate the protection of the safety and health of workers.  The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees.  Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of the Company’s operations.  For example, under a new OSHA standard limiting respirable silica exposure, the oil and gas industry must implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 2021.  Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.
Derivatives Regulation
 Comprehensive financial reform legislation was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2010, (“Dodd-Frank Act”).  The legislation called for the CFTC to regulate certain markets for derivative products, including over-the-counter derivatives.  While many rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, some have not, and as a result, the final form of the regulatory regime for commodity derivatives remains uncertain.
 Position limits for certain energy commodity futures and options contracts, as well as economically equivalent swaps, futures and options, are subject to ongoing rulemaking activities.  The CFTC’s original position-limits rule was vacated and remanded by a federal district court in 2012.  The CFTC subsequently proposed new rules in November 2013, which it supplemented in June 2016, and then reproposed in revised form in December 2016.  In January 2020, the CFTC withdrew the 2013 proposal, the 2016 supplement, and the 2016 reproposal, and issued a new proposed rule, which includes limits on positions in (1) certain “Core Referenced Futures Contracts,” including contracts for several energy commodities; (2) futures and options on futures that are directly or indirectly linked to the price of a Core Referenced Futures Contract, or to the same commodity for delivery at the same location as specified in that Core Referenced Futures Contract; and (3) economically equivalent swaps.  The proposal also includes exemptions from position limits for bona fide hedging activities, which we expect we will qualify for if the exemptions are finalized as currently proposed.  As the proposal is not yet final, the impact of the proposed rule on the Company and its counterparties is uncertain at this time.
 The CFTC requires that market participants must clear certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, but clearing is not required for physical commodity swaps.  The CFTC also requires certain market participants to maintain minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps.  The Company qualifies for end-user exceptions from both the clearing and margin requirements, although the application of these rules to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may affect the cost and availability of the swaps the Company uses for hedging.  In addition, if any of the Company’s swaps do not qualify for the end-user exceptions in the future, then the Company may be required to clear such transactions or execute them on a derivatives contract market or swap execution facility and post collateral, which could impact the Company’s liquidity.
 Although the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of remaining Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings, or of any new rules that may be proposed pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, to the extent they are applicable to the Company or its derivative counterparties, they may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments the Company uses to manage its financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in commodity prices.
 The Company’s derivatives activities and sales of oil and natural gas are also subject to anti-manipulation and anti-disruptive-practices authority under (i) the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the CFTC, and (ii) the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (“EISA”) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FTC.  The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits any person from using or employing any manipulative or deceptive device in connection with any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity, or for future delivery on such commodity. It also prohibits knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered false, misleading or inaccurate reports concerning market information or conditions that affect or tend to affect the price of any commodity.  The FTC’s Petroleum Market Manipulation Rule, issued pursuant to the EISA, prohibits fraudulent or deceptive conduct in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil or refined petroleum products.  Fines for violations of the CEA and the EISA can be up to $1 million per day per violation, subject to adjustment for inflation, and certain knowing or willful violations may also lead to a felony conviction.
