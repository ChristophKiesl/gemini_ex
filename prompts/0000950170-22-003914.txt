 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing the next-generation of precision oncology medicines that inhibit DNA damage repair and cause cancer cell death in specific subsets of cancer patients through a therapeutic strategy known as synthetic lethality.
 Our lead program, CYT-0851, was designed to exploit a novel synthetic lethality between overexpression of a family of DNA damaging enzymes called cytidine deaminases, or CD, and functional inhibition of homologous recombination, or HR, a DNA repair pathway critical for the survival of some cancers. We observed preliminary single-agent activity in the dose-escalation phase 1 portion of our phase 1/2 trial, which we completed in November 2021. In January 2022, we initiated patient dosing with CYT-0851 in the phase 2 expansion cohort portion of the phase 1/2 trial in adult patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. If warranted by the phase 1/2 data, and subject to FDA agreement, we could initiate a potentially registrational trial in early 2023 for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory lymphoma and/or solid tumors. We also plan to develop CYT-0851 in additional tumor settings as both a monotherapy and in combination with approved cancer therapeutics. In January 2022, we initiated patient dosing in the phase 1 portion of the phase 1/2 trial to assess tolerability and preliminary activity of combinations with three standard-of-care therapies.
 Cells have complex, coordinated DNA damage repair pathways to ensure genome integrity and cell survival. Several DNA repair pathways have been identified for repairing the myriad forms of DNA damage our cells experience. Double strand DNA, or dsDNA, breaks are particularly toxic, and cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to repair such fatal lesions. The three major dsDNA break repair pathways are non-homologous end joining, or NHEJ, microhomology-mediated end joining, or MMEJ, and HR. NHEJ and MMEJ are considered error-prone repair pathways based on the way they repair dsDNA breaks, while HR is generally thought to be an error-free repair mechanism because the repair is templated by the homologous sister chromosome, thereby restoring the original DNA sequence. Single strand DNA, or ssDNA, damage is also repaired by specific ssDNA repair pathways, including Base Excision Repair, or BER, Nucleotide Excision Repair, or NER, and Mismatch Repair, or MMR, which proofreads and corrects DNA errors introduced during normal DNA replication. Activity of this highly coordinated network of DNA damage sensing and repairing pathways is collectively called the DNA Damage Response, or DDR.
 A hallmark feature of cancer cells is the accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability that leads to DNA mutations that often drive the aggressive characteristics of cancer cells, such as uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion into surrounding tissues and, importantly, resistance to standard therapies. By their nature, cancer cells suffer excessive DNA damage compared to normal cells, and this increases their dependence on DNA repair processes to prevent the accumulation of genome-wide, catastrophic levels of DNA damage that would otherwise trigger cell death. This dynamic creates the opportunity for selectively targeting these cancers through the therapeutic strategy known as synthetic lethality.
 Synthetic lethality is a clinically validated approach to drug development and arises when the occurrence of two cellular conditions is lethal when occurring simultaneously but tolerated when occurring individually. For example, a pre-existing, cancer-specific gene mutation (the first condition) might be synthetically lethal only in the presence of therapeutic inhibition of a specific target protein (the second condition). The existence of the cancer-specific gene mutation makes the therapeutic intervention lethal to the cancer cells, but relatively innocuous to the normal cells that do not express the sensitizing mutation. Leveraging synthetic lethality is a potentially powerful approach in cancer drug discovery because it may lead to better tolerated therapies that preferentially kill cancer cells and it facilitates the identification of patient subpopulations most likely to respond to therapy.
 Our approach to drug discovery and development
We are using our expertise in DDR biology and a disciplined approach to select targets for novel, differentiated drug discovery and development programs. Our approach includes:
•systematically prioritizing DDR targets based on our deep understanding of DDR biology, coupled with the mining of mutational information collected on diseased tissues and the analysis of results from both internal and external CRISPR-based genetic, chemical and cellular phenotypic synthetic lethality screens; 
 •elucidating synthetic lethality dependencies of our drug targets and using that information to molecularly define patient populations most likely to benefit from our therapies as a monotherapy, and maximizing tumor selectivity that limits side effects and allows our drugs to be used in combination with other standard anti-cancer therapies; 

   •developing potent, highly selective, well tolerated, small molecule therapies against these targets and evaluating them in biomarker-selected in vitro and in vivo model systems; and 
 •expeditiously progressing lead candidates through preclinical studies and into focused clinical trials in defined patient populations using a biomarker-guided approach. 
 Our core capabilities in discovery biology focusing on DNA damage repair have enabled us to move efficiently from drug discovery to clinical development. We have a management team with successful global registration experience that we believe has the potential to advance our drug candidates to registration. In only three years, we progressed CYT-0851 from discovery to clinical proof of concept. In 2022, we intend to define our registration plan to advance toward the potential approval of CYT-0851, initially as monotherapy in late lines of treatment for certain lymphomas and/or solid tumors. In addition, we may broaden the target patient population in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors and move to earlier lines of treatment, either alone and/or in combination with standard-of-care anti-cancer therapies.
Our pipeline
The following chart summarizes our clinical and preclinical-drug candidate pipeline. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to our drug candidates.



* CYT-0851 monotherapy and combination therapy indications include DLBCL, FL, MM, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and soft tissue sarcoma; CYT-1853 monotherapy indications to be determined ** Following the phase 1/2 trial, the pivotal trial could be a phase 3 trial, or if the phase 1/2 data warrant and subject to FDA agreement, a phase 2 registrational trial. If the FDA does not agree, or the data do not warrant advancing to a pivotal trial, we may be required to conduct an additional trial before advancing to the pivotal trial.
Our programs
Clinical
 Our lead program, CYT-0851, was identified through a phenotypic screening strategy that exploited a novel synthetic lethality between CD overexpression and HR inhibition. The screen was designed to select for compounds that induced synthetic lethality in CD-overexpressing cancer cells while sparing normal cells.
CYT-0851 is a novel, oral, once-daily, small molecule drug candidate that has demonstrated a high therapeutic index. We completed the monotherapy dose-escalation portion of our phase 1/2 trial in November 2021, which included 73 patients enrolled across 12 dose-escalation cohorts. We identified the maximally tolerated dose, or MTD, as 600 mg daily and the recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, as 400 mg daily. The dose-escalation portion of the trial was primarily designed to identify the MTD with secondary endpoint measurements that included the formal analysis of anti-tumor activity as assessed by tumor response. As phase 1 trials designed in this way do not compare patients treated with a given investigational drug to those administered standard-of-care or placebo, an analysis of statistical significance cannot be performed and thus phase 1 studies are not powered for statistical significance. Phase 1 response data is not sufficient, nor intended to be used, for drug approval and additional trials will be required to further characterize the safety and efficacy in larger populations. We performed an analysis of all patients in the dose-escalation portion of our phase 1/2 trial as of November 15, 2021. Based on this analysis, 46 patients were considered response-evaluable, and we observed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit with 17 patients achieving stable disease, one patient with follicular lymphoma achieving a complete response, two patients with
   diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and soft tissue sarcoma achieving partial responses, and the remaining 26 patients having progressive disease. The responses in DLBCL and follicular lymphoma were confirmed by Lugano criteria, and the partial response in soft tissue sarcoma was unconfirmed according to RECIST criteria. Of these 73 patients, 58% reported at least one treatment-related adverse event and only 16% of patients reported at least one Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse event. The three most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (21% of patients), hyperuricemia (11%), and nausea (11%). In January 2022, we initiated patient dosing with CYT-0851 in the phase 2 expansion cohort portion of the phase 1/2 trial, with six tumor-specific cohorts. If warranted by the phase 1/2 data, and subject to FDA agreement, we could initiate a potentially registrational trial in early 2023 for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory lymphoma and/or solid tumors.
To expand the therapeutic potential of CYT-0851 beyond monotherapy use, we conducted preclinical studies to explore combinations with a variety of standard-of-care anti-cancer drugs. We have observed both additive and synergistic treatment effects in preclinical studies with a variety of agents, including alkylating agents such as bendamustine, and anti-metabolites such as gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil. We believe the encouraging preclinical results in conjunction with the favorable monotherapy clinical activity and tolerability of CYT-0851 to date provide a strong rationale for the development of a combination therapy in the future. In January 2022, we initiated patient dosing of CYT-0851 in combination with approved standard-of-care anti-cancer therapies in the phase 1 portion of the phase 1/2 trial.
Preclinical
 Our next-generation program, CYT-1853, was designed to exploit the same novel synthetic lethality targeted by CYT-0851. Importantly, in preclinical models, CYT-1853 was active across a range of cancer cell lines and exhibited improved potency compared to CYT-0851. We expect to complete IND-enabling studies with CYT-1853 in the first half of 2022 and if the data supports an overall risk-benefit improvement and differentiation from CYT-0851, we plan to file an IND application with the FDA by year-end 2022.
In 2021, we advanced two additional drug discovery projects focused on identifying inhibitors of DNA damage repair targets that exploit specific synthetic lethalities. The first of these undisclosed targets (Target 2) plays a key role in Non-Homologous End Joining, or NHEJ, and the second (Target 3) in Microhomology-Mediated End Joining, or MMEJ, DNA repair pathways. For both targeted drug discovery projects, we have identified subsets of cancers that, we believe, uniquely depend on the target of interest for their survival and we are working to identify patient selection biomarkers to identify sensitive cancer subsets for use in clinical development. Both undisclosed target projects are preclinical stage, and we anticipate reaching the drug candidate nomination stage in 2023.
 Additionally, we continually monitor the DDR and synthetic lethality landscape for promising and differentiated new target opportunities to initiate in-house or in-license to enrich our drug candidate pipeline.
 Our management team
We have assembled a management team of biopharmaceutical industry veterans with extensive experience in developing novel oncology therapies, including advancing drug candidates from preclinical research through clinical development and ultimately regulatory approval and commercialization. Our executive management team includes veterans from Amgen Inc., ArQule Inc., AstraZeneca, Aton Pharma, Celgene Corporation, Chiron, Genzyme, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, MedImmune, Merck & Co., Inc., McKinsey & Co., OSI Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacia, Pharmacyclics, Pharmion Corporation, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, and Searle & Co. Inc.
 Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing next-generation precision oncology medicines that inhibit DDR and cause cancer cell death through synthetic lethality. We employ an integrated drug discovery approach with a streamlined drug development process with the aim to build a patient-centric portfolio of effective cancer therapies.
   The key elements of our strategy are to:
•Build upon the differentiated profile and encouraging preliminary single-agent activity of our lead drug candidate, CYT-0851, to advance it through clinical development and regulatory approval. We are currently in a phase 1/2 trial for both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors and, depending on the cancer type, we may develop a biomarker for patient enrichment. If warranted by the phase 1/2 data, and subject to FDA agreement, we could initiate a potentially registrational trial in early 2023 for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory lymphoma and/or solid tumors. In addition, we intend to advance our next-generation program, CYT-1853, through clinical development and regulatory approval to complement CYT-0851. We expect to complete IND-enabling studies with CYT-1853 in the first half of 2022 and if the data supports an overall risk-benefit improvement and differentiation from CYT-0851, we plan to file an IND application with the FDA by year-end 2022.
 •Leverage CYT-0851’s favorable monotherapy clinical activity and tolerability to develop it in combination with standard-of-care anti-cancer therapies. In parallel with monotherapy development, we are evaluating CYT-0851 in combination with standard-of-care anti-cancer drugs. We have selected three regimens for our initial combination evaluation that include: (1) rituximab plus bendamustine, (2) gemcitabine, and (3) capecitabine. We are currently dosing cohorts of patients as part of the ongoing phase 1 portion of the phase 1/2 trial to explore tolerability and preliminary activity of the above combinations.
 •Utilize our deep understanding of DDR and tumor biology to identify novel drug candidates and expand our pipeline. We have initiated high-throughput screening on two additional drug discovery projects focused on identifying inhibitors of DNA damage repair that exploit specific synthetic lethalities. The first of these undisclosed targets (Target 2) plays a key role in NHEJ and the second (Target 3) in MMEJ DNA repair pathways. For both targeted drug discovery projects, we have identified subsets of cancers that, we believe, uniquely depend on the target of interest for their survival and we are working to identify patient selection biomarkers to identify sensitive cancer subsets for use in clinical development. Both undisclosed target projects are preclinical stage, and we anticipate reaching the drug candidate nomination stage in 2023.
 
Additionally, we continually monitor the DDR and synthetic lethality landscape for promising and differentiated new target opportunities to initiate in-house or in-license to enrich our drug candidate pipeline.
 •Maximize the value of our drug candidates and pipeline while selectively evaluating strategic collaborations. We own all worldwide rights to our pipeline of precision-oncology programs, and we intend to commercialize our drug candidates, if approved, in key geographies. In the future, we may selectively enter into strategic collaborations around certain targets, drug candidates, disease areas or geographies if we believe these collaborations could maximize the value of our drug candidates. Additionally, we continually monitor the DDR and synthetic lethality landscape for promising and differentiated new target opportunities to initiate in-house or in-license to enrich our drug candidate pipeline. 
 Cancer treatments moving toward targeted therapeutics but unmet need remains
Advances in the molecular and genetic understanding of cancer have driven a fundamental shift away from cytotoxic chemotherapy treatments toward more targeted therapies that address aberrations in the cellular pathways and proteins necessary for cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival. These targeted therapies provide a precise method for treating the patients who are most likely to clinically benefit from them. For example, certain patients with lung cancer express mutated forms of epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, which have been validated targets for EGFR-directed therapies. Other targeted therapies address dysregulated pathways that are shared among an entire disease specific population, such as the use of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors in renal cell carcinoma. Despite their successes, targeted therapies have had limited utility in cancers that (1) have no identifiable therapeutic targets, (2) have an identifiable target, but it is not “druggable” given the limitations of current technologies, or (3) ultimately develop resistance through mutations, the use of alternative pathways or the loss of the target. Combining therapies and treating cancer through orthogonal pathways with multiple agents can limit the development of resistance to targeted therapies; however, the overlapping toxicity profile of many targeted agents has prevented their use in combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation. We believe that DNA damage repair, essential for the survival of many cancer cells and for the progression of tumors, provides a unique opportunity to improve patient outcomes by expanding the number of addressable targets and allowing for combination with current standard-of-care therapies.
   The importance of DNA damage repair
DNA is constantly under barrage by DNA damaging agents, including ultraviolet radiation in sunlight, carcinogens found in pesticides and tobacco smoke, and even naturally occurring substances produced by our cells during the normal processes of cell growth and division. This damage can occur on one or both strands of DNA, and it has been estimated that every cell in our body endures tens of thousands of DNA damaging events per day.



Different DNA repair pathways sense and repair the myriad types of DNA damage that all cells incur daily. Some of the better characterized DNA repair pathways shown above include dsDNA repair pathways such as HR, NHEJ, MMEJ, and ssDNA repair pathways such as BER, NER, and MMR.
Dependence on DNA damage repair creates a therapeutic opportunity in cancer
A hallmark feature of cancer is genomic instability driven by extensive DNA damage that must be repaired for cancer cells to survive. By selectively inhibiting DNA repair, DDR-targeted cancer therapies can cause the massive accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage in cancer cells, ultimately inducing cell death through a process known as mitotic catastrophe. Normal cells are generally not as predisposed to DDR-driven cell death because they express a full complement of overlapping DNA repair pathways as well as fully functional cell cycle checkpoint safeguards—these pathways, sensing DNA damage, direct the cell to stop dividing until its DNA is properly repaired, thereby avoiding mitotic catastrophe. The figure below depicts how cells utilize DDR pathways to repair damaged DNA, and how the increased levels of DNA damage that cancer cells incur can make them more dependent on specific DNA damage repair pathways, such as HR, and more sensitive to DDR-targeted therapies.
 
   Cancer cells become dependent on DNA damage repair pathways
 
   
Harnessing the therapeutic potential of synthetic lethality in DDR
Synthetic lethality is a clinically validated approach to drug development and arises when the occurrence of two cellular conditions is lethal when occurring simultaneously but tolerated when occurring individually. For example, a pre-existing, cancer-specific gene mutation (the first condition) might be synthetically lethal only in the presence of therapeutic inhibition of a specific target protein (the second condition). The existence of the cancer-specific gene mutation makes the therapeutic intervention lethal to the cancer cells, but relatively innocuous to the normal cells that do not express the sensitizing mutation. Because DDR defects are common in nearly all cancers, DNA repair pathways are fertile areas to discover novel synthetic lethal targets for the development of effective targeted cancer therapies.
A clinically validated example of synthetic lethality is the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors to treat a subset of tumors that harbor certain HR deficiencies. For example, in subsets of ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, pre-existing mutations in the Breast Cancer Genes, or BRCA, functionally impair HR and render those cancer cells sensitive to treatment with PARP inhibitors. The co-existence of both conditions – the pre-existing loss-of-function BRCA mutation and the therapeutic targeting of PARP – creates synthetic lethality that leads to cancer-specific cell death. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities have approved four PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients, including those with BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Global sales of PARP inhibitors in 2021 totaled more than $3.5 billion.
Synthetic lethality opportunities for CYT-0851
 Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase, or AID, is a member of a larger family of enzymes referred to as CDs. CDs are tightly regulated nucleic acid damaging enzymes that convert cytidine into uridine by removing an amine group, a process known as deamination. The deamination of cytidine to uridine in DNA creates base pair mismatching that fosters DNA mutations and dsDNA breaks. In normal B cells, AID is transiently expressed and tightly regulated to concentrate its mutagenic action on the DNA encoding our antibody genes, a beneficial effect that ultimately improves our immunity. When AID becomes constitutively overexpressed and dysregulated, as it often does in certain forms of cancer, such as B-cell lymphomas, it leads to genome-wide DNA damage and collateral mutations beyond our antibody genes. To avoid mitotic catastrophe, cancer cells frequently rely on DNA damage repair pathways, including HR, to properly repair the harmful damage incurred to genes vital for the cancer’s survival. This increased dependency on HR presents a therapeutic opportunity in those cancers overexpressing AID, including B-cell lymphomas.
 In addition to subsets of B-cell lymphoma, CDs are also often highly expressed in subsets of solid tumors, such as head and neck, breast, and lung cancers. This observation supports our belief that therapies targeting HR and exploiting the synthetic lethality relationship created by CD overexpression might have broad utility across both hematologic malignancies and solid tumor cancers.
Beyond CD gene overexpression, it is plausible that additional cellular conditions exist in subsets of cancers, such as specific defects in alternative DNA damage repair pathways or cell cycle checkpoint genes that create synthetic lethality with HR inhibition. Such conditions may provide additional therapeutic opportunities for our lead program and are being
   explored. 
Synthetic lethality opportunities for CYT-0851 in combination therapy
Monotherapy treatment relying on the synthetic lethality described above requires pre-existing, intrinsic defects in the cancer cells. Combination therapy, on the other hand, can create the synthetic lethality in cancer cells without any pre-existing defects in DDR pathways. Such combination therapy potentially could be used broadly across cancer types and with multiple classes of chemotherapy drugs and other DDR agents.
We are currently dosing patients in the phase 1 portion of the phase 1/2 trial evaluating CYT-0851 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs including: (1) rituximab plus bendamustine, (2) gemcitabine and (3) capecitabine for the treatment of either hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.
Initial chemotherapy combinations support potential treatment in a broad range of cancers


The clinical utility of such a combination approach in the past has been limited by the overlapping toxicities of DDR inhibitors, such as PARP inhibitors or other experimental agents, and chemotherapy, particularly with respect to myelosuppression. We believe that the observed safety profile of CYT-0851, particularly the lack of clinically significant myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting observed to date in the ongoing phase 1/2 trial, may allow such combinations to be feasible.
CYT-0851
 Program overview
CYT-0851 is a novel, oral, once-daily, small molecule drug candidate currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
In preclinical studies, CYT-0851 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity, cancer cell selectivity, and favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles that support its potential as a novel therapy that could address the serious unmet need in multiple cancers. We efficiently and expeditiously advanced CYT-0851 into the clinic with a development strategy designed to support the potential regulatory approval for treatment of patients with certain hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.
We are currently conducting a phase 1/2 trial, which we refer to as Study CYT-0851-01, enrolling patients with either hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. The first portion of the trial established 400 mg daily as the RP2D and schedule of CYT-0851 as a monotherapy. The phase 2 expansion cohort portion of the trial, for which we began patient dosing in January 2022, is evaluating the preliminary anti-tumor activity of CYT-0851 monotherapy at this dose and schedule in various hematologic malignancies and solid tumors including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, follicular lymphoma, or FL, multiple myeloma, or MM, ovarian cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and pancreatic cancer and confirming the safety of the RP2D. This study is intended to provide these necessary insights to support our broad development program of CYT-0851.
In the dose-escalation portion of our trial to date, CYT-0851 has demonstrated the potential for achieving anti-tumor effects in a variety of advanced solid tumors or hematologic malignancies while maintaining a favorable safety profile. If warranted by the phase 1/2 data, and subject to FDA agreement, we could initiate a potentially registrational trial in early 2023 for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory lymphoma and/or solid tumors.
 We also are enrolling patient cohorts in the phase 1 dose-escalation of CYT-0851 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs including: 1) rituximab plus bendamustine 2) gemcitabine and 3) capecitabine for the treatment of either hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.
Hematologic malignancies and the current standard of care
Hematologic malignancies are a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized as cancers arising from cells originating in the bone marrow or lymphoid tissues. Given their cell of origin, these cancers readily spread throughout the body through the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems and typically require a systemic approach for treatment and cannot be
   cured by surgery or localized radiation therapy in most cases. Certain diseases such as DLBCL, the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, are potentially curable with aggressive therapies even in the most advanced setting, while other disorders such as FL and MM are treated with the goal of long-term disease and symptom control because cure typically has not been possible. The first line of treatment for the majority of these disorders consists of combination therapy comprised of chemotherapy, targeted agents and/or radiation. When the disease progresses, commonly referred to as relapsed or refractory disease, alternative regimens and combinations are employed, but typically with reduced rates of success and shorter duration of benefit at each progression until the patient exhausts their therapeutic options, is no longer in a physical condition to receive treatment or elects to discontinue active treatment of their disease.
Hematologic malignancies market opportunity
In 2022, according to the American Cancer Society, 184,000 newly diagnosed hematologic malignancy cases and more than 57,000 deaths are expected in the United States. MM is expected to account for more than 34,000 of these new cases. DLBCL and FL are expected to account for about 42,400 new cases. These three indications included in our phase 2 expansion cohort study of CYT-0851 are expected to account for an estimated 20,000 deaths in 2022, indicative of the large ongoing unmet need.

 Hematologic malignancies: CYT-0851 development plan
We are enrolling patients with DLBCL, FL and MM in the phase 2 expansion cohort study of our phase 1/2 clinical trial for CYT-0851. If warranted by the phase 1/2 data, and subject to FDA agreement, we intend to initiate a potentially registrational trial in early 2023 for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory lymphoma.
In December 2021, we initiated the phase 1 evaluation of CYT-0851 in combination with rituximab and bendamustine for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Solid tumors and the current standard of care
Solid tumors are cancers originating from an organ or tissue outside the blood and lymphatic systems. These tumors are further classified, named and ultimately treated based on their tissue of origin, such as breast, ovarian or pancreatic cancer. Solid tumors are responsible for the vast majority of cancers and account for more than 1.7 million new diagnoses in the United States annually. Unlike hematologic malignancies, some solid tumors are identified early through screening procedures or symptomatic presentation prior to spreading throughout the body. In these instances, the cancer can often be removed by surgical excision to ultimately cure the patient’s disease. Outcomes for early-stage disease are highly variable across tumor types, with most early-stage colorectal and breast cancers being cured and almost all pancreatic cancers recurring and metastasizing even despite early intervention. Once solid tumors metastasize, or spread to other sites in the body, the goal of therapy often shifts to long-term control and palliation since cures are typically unattainable. In this incurable setting, the most effective therapies are typically used in combination with the first lines of treatment, and subsequent lines of treatment typically become progressively less effective. The number of available lines of therapy is disease type-specific and generally ranges from as low as one to two lines of therapy in pancreatic cancer and soft tissue sarcoma to more than five lines of therapy in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Patients remain on treatment until they have exhausted all therapeutic options, develop symptoms that preclude further treatment or elect to stop further treatment of their cancer.
Solid tumor market opportunity
According to the American Cancer Society, the 2022 estimated United States annual incidence and mortality of the three types of malignancies included in our phase 2 expansion cohort study of CYT-0851 are expected to exceed 92,000 and 66,000, respectively, indicative of the large unmet need.

 Solid tumors: CYT-0851 development plan
The solid tumor phase 2 monotherapy expansion cohorts of our CYT-0851 phase 1/2 trial include patients with pancreatic and ovarian cancers and soft tissue sarcomas. If warranted by the phase 1/2 data, and subject to FDA agreement, we could initiate one or more potentially registrational trials in 2023 for the treatment of either relapsed or refractory lymphoma or solid tumors.
We are currently dosing patients in the phase 1 portion of the phase 1/2 trial that evaluates two cohorts of combinations of CYT-0851 with gemcitabine or capecitabine for the treatment of solid tumors.
CYT-0851 monotherapy clinical trial design (Study CYT-0851-01)
Study CYT-0851-01 is a phase 1/2 clinical trial of both hematologic malignancies and solid cancers evaluating CYT-0851 in advanced cancer patients who have exhausted standard therapies. In November 2021 we completed enrollment in the phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study, utilizing a standard 3+3 design to establish a single monotherapy dose for all malignancies. Seventy-three patients have been treated in 12 dose levels and 600 mg daily was established as the MTD and 400 mg daily was selected as the monotherapy RP2D. Upon identification of the monotherapy RP2D, we initiated phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts of CYT-0851 in combination with standard dosing of three standard-of-care chemotherapies: (1) rituximab plus bendamustine, (2) gemcitabine and (3) capecitabine. The starting dose of CYT-0851 with each combination is 100 mg daily, which will be escalated in each cohort independently according to a standard 3+3 design to a maximum of 400 mg daily. The primary endpoint for phase 1 is dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, to identify the MTD. Secondary endpoints are pharmacokinetics, safety, and preliminary anti-tumor activity. Our design also includes pharmacodynamic backfill cohorts that allow us to enroll up to 12 patients in total at any dose level to further characterize the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles for dose selection, as well as collect additional tumor biopsies for biomarker development.
 Trial design for the phase 1 portion of the trial
 
Upon selection of a RP2D we initiated the phase 2 expansion phase of the study in January 2022 and are currently dosing patients. The primary endpoint for this phase is the objective response rate to characterize the anti-tumor activity of CYT-0851 in six disease-specific expansion cohorts: DLBCL, MM, FL, soft-tissue sarcoma, ovarian and pancreatic cancers. We made a strategic decision to delay opening the mantle cell lymphoma and triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, cohorts based on the evolving treatment and regulatory landscapes. The secondary endpoints for this portion of the study include further assessment
   of the clinical activity in terms of duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival, as well as safety and pharmacokinetics.
To assess the primary endpoint, each phase 2 cohort will proceed with a Simon two-stage design. This approach minimizes the number of patients to be enrolled. This design enrolls and evaluates the response in a set number of patients in the first stage. The proportion of responding patients is assessed and, if sufficient, enrollment into the second stage proceeds to further evaluate the response rate. Our target response rates for each indication are based on historical benchmarks for standard of care. Each cohort will independently guide future development for each disease indication and may include further expansion of the cohort in the current trial, commencement of randomized trials, pursuit of an accelerated approval registration pathway, therapeutic combination strategies or some permutation thereof.
 Trial design for the phase 2 expansion cohorts
 
Current phase 1/2 trial (Study CYT-0851-01) interim results 
As of November 15, 2021, we had treated 73 patients across 12 dose-escalation cohorts. We identified 600 mg daily as the MTD and selected 400 mg daily as the monotherapy RP2D. We performed an aggregated analysis for the safety and clinical activity. 
Safety assessment 
CYT-0851 has a favorable safety profile characterized by infrequent, primarily low-grade (Grade 1 or 2) and reversible adverse events, or AEs. Only 58% of patients have reported any treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, the majority of which were low-grade (Grade 1-2) and manageable. The most common CYT-0851-related AEs were primarily low grade and included fatigue (21% of patients), hyperuricemia (11%), and nausea (11%). We believe that these results support development of CYT-0851 not only as a monotherapy but also in combination with other anti-cancer agents given the lack of overlapping toxicities such as clinically significant myelosuppression, neuropathy, vomiting and diarrhea that typically preclude combination strategies.

Efficacy assessment
 As of November 15, 2021, 46 patients were considered response-evaluable per protocol (treated with CYT-0851 and had at least one post-baseline disease assessment). One patient experienced a complete response, or CR, and two patients experienced partial responses, or PR. Seventeen of these patients had stable disease, or SD, and twenty-six of these patients experienced progressive disease, or PD, as their best overall response according to disease specific criteria (RECIST v1.1 or modified Lugano response criteria). The CR in FL and PR in DLBCL were confirmed by Lugano criteria, and the PR in soft tissue sarcoma was unconfirmed according to RECIST criteria.

Pharmacokinetic assessment
 Preliminary pharmacokinetic analyses of CYT-0851 demonstrated approximately dose-proportional systemic exposure. A mean plasma effective half-life of approximately three days supported transition from twice daily to once daily administration. Furthermore, the minimum exposure projected to be clinically active, based on preclinical studies, was reached at 90 mg total daily dose. 
Mechanism of action
CYT-0851 was identified through a phenotypic screening strategy that exploited a novel synthetic lethality between CD overexpression and HR inhibition. The screen was designed to select for compounds that induced synthetic lethality in CD-overexpressing cancer cells while sparing normal cells. By its nature, this type of screening strategy does not depend on, nor directly lead to, a precise understanding of where active drug candidates bind, nor their precise mechanism of action. While CYT-0851 advances in clinical testing, we continue to make progress on elucidating its molecular target and mechanism of action.
CYT-0851 initial patient targeting
Hematologic malignancies
We are initially targeting patients with DLBCL, FL and MM. CYT-0851 has several features that may differentiate it from other drugs on the market and in development for these indications. CYT-0851 is orally delivered and, if approved, would be dosed as an outpatient treatment. Many of the currently approved therapies are intravenous, require hospitalization or specialized centers for administration, have limited durations of treatment due to cumulative treatment side effects, or may not be feasibly administered in the community setting. The lack of clinically significant myelosuppression and the overall safety observed to date for CYT-0851 may allow prolonged dosing strategies and treatment of patients who are elderly or frail or have limited bone marrow and end organ reserve from prior therapies. We have not identified cumulative toxicities in humans treated up to 17 months at our RP2D or below. CYT-0851 can also be potentially combined with other therapies to both delay the onset of resistance and improve efficacy.
Our estimates described below for potentially addressable patient populations, where included, are based on a combination of third-party estimates, our internal estimates and management’s experience. Starting with the annual incidence for our target indications, we estimated the number of patients that receive each line of treatment based on statistics reported in journal articles or specialized disease reports and then matched our proposed CYT-0851 treatment profile to each addressable patient line to estimate a total addressable population for CYT-0851. If we ultimately use one or more
   biomarkers to select patients for future trials, we will adjust these addressable market estimates for the expected frequency of the biomarkers.
If approved, CYT-0851 may initially be available as a third or later line of treatment in DLBCL patients whose disease has progressed after two lines of standard therapy, or in patients who cannot tolerate standard first- or second-line therapies due to age, frailty or other factors. We estimate that there may be up to approximately 9,500 patients meeting these treatment criteria annually in the U.S.
In FL, CYT-0851 may initially be available for refractory patients as a third or later line of treatment. If CYT-0851 proves tolerable in FL patients, enabling a long duration of treatment, we believe the addressable FL market could be substantial. We estimate that there may be up to approximately 8,500 patients meeting these treatment criteria annually in the U.S.
We are including MM patients in our phase 2 expansion cohort study of CYT-0851. If results are positive, we anticipate targeting MM patients previously treated with three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, or IMiD, and an anti-CD38 antibody. 

Malignancy | Initial treatment opportunity
DLBCL |  | 3rd Line+ 
 |  | 1st/2nd Line+ for elderly/frail patients 
FL |  | 3rd Line+ 
 |  | st/2nd Line+ for elderly/frail patients 
MM |  | Treated with three prior therapies including a proteosome inhibitor, IMiD and anti-CD38 antibody

 Solid tumors
To date in our phase 1/2 clinical trial of CYT-0851, we have observed decreases in tumor burden in 10 patients with solid tumors including a partial response in a patient with soft tissue sarcoma (30% reduction). These observations are consistent with our preclinical data indicating that a subset of solid tumor cancer models, including pancreatic and breast cancer PDX models, is sensitive to CYT-0851. We are further evaluating the activity of CYT-0851 in patients with pancreatic and ovarian cancers, as well as soft tissue sarcomas, in our phase 2 expansion cohort study.
We currently define the initial target patient population in pancreatic cancer to be second and later line treatments. We estimate that there may be up to approximately 32,500 patients meeting these treatment criteria annually in the U.S.
In ovarian cancer, we could initially target patients who are progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors for patients who are HR deficient. As the majority of patients are receiving both of these agents as part of a first-line regimen, we believe we could target second and later lines as an initial target population. We estimate that there may be up to approximately 13,000 patients meeting these treatment criteria annually in the U.S.
Soft tissue sarcomas are a heterogeneous collection of tumors from both a cell-of-origin and genetic standpoint. In the phase 1 dose-escalation portion of Study CYT-0851-01, in 15 response evaluable patients, we have observed seven sarcoma patients with SD, seven with PD and one with a partial response by RECIST criteria. Based on these observations, and the unmet need, we believe a path toward accelerated approval of CYT-0851 may be possible. Based on these initial clinical results, we anticipate the initial target population in soft tissue sarcomas will be second or later line treatment.

   Preclinical Programs
 CYT-1853
 Program overview
Our next-generation compound, CYT-1853, was designed to exploit the same novel synthetic lethality targeted by CYT-0851. The primary goal of the program was to discover and develop a more potent compound. Our rationale was that a more potent compound might not only demonstrate improved anti-cancer activity in sensitive tumor types but may also be effective in cancers relatively insensitive to the first-generation compound. After extensive screening efforts, CYT-1853 was selected as our more potent next-generation drug candidate. We expect to complete IND-enabling studies with CYT-1853 in the first half of 2022 and, if the data supports an overall risk-benefit improvement and differentiation from CYT-0851, we plan to file an IND application with the FDA by year-end 2022. Evaluation of the potential differentiation of CYT-1853 from CYT-0851 will include consideration of results of ongoing pre-clinical evaluation of CYT-1853 as well as ongoing clinical evaluation of CYT-0851. For example, if the potential clinical benefits of CYT-0851 are observed to be greater than originally hypothesized the comparative benefits of CYT-1853 could be reduced which could lead to a decision to not move CYT-1853 into the clinic.
 Preclinical data
To identify compounds more potent than our first generation drug candidate, we used a cell-based screening assay to measure and compare the potency of novel compounds to that of CYT-0851. In the original phenotypic screening assay, CYT-1853 was 34-fold more potent than CYT-0851 at inhibiting in vitro cell proliferation of the AID-overexpressing Daudi Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line.
 Beyond Burkitt’s lymphoma, CYT-1853 has demonstrated broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity across a panel of over 400 diverse human cancer cell lines, generally displaying about 10-fold improved potency over CYT-0851 across the cell line panel. The observation that most of the cell lines were more sensitive to CYT-1853 than CYT-0851 supports the possibility that CYT-1853 may be able to treat tumor types where CYT-0851 lacks sufficient efficacy. Importantly, CYT-1853 has also demonstrated dose-dependent in vivo anti-cancer activity in multiple mouse models of human cancer at tolerated doses. Additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies are underway to further characterize and evaluate the overall risk-benefit profile of CYT-1853 and potential differentiation from CYT-0851.
Undisclosed Targets 2 & 3
Program overview
 In 2021, we advanced two additional drug discovery projects focused on identifying inhibitors of DNA damage repair. Rather than using a phenotypic screening paradigm as we did for CYT-0851 and CYT-1853, in both of these projects we are using a more traditional drug discovery approach by first identifying the molecular target of interest. The first of these undisclosed targets (Target 2) plays a key role in NHEJ and the second (Target 3) in MMEJ DNA repair pathways. For both targeted drug discovery projects, we have identified subsets of cancers that, we believe, uniquely depend on the target of interest for their survival and we are working to confirm patient selection biomarkers to identify these cancer subsets for use in drug candidate development. Both undisclosed target projects are preclinical stage, and we anticipate reaching the drug candidate nomination stage in 2023.
 Additionally, we continually monitor the DDR and synthetic lethality landscape for promising and differentiated new target opportunities to initiate in-house or in-license to enrich our drug candidate pipeline.
 Competition
While we believe that our technology, drug development expertise and deep understanding of DDR biology provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions that are involved in the discovery, development, and commercialization of oncology therapeutics.
Many other companies are advancing oncology therapeutics that target DNA repair, including AbbVie, Artios Pharma, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, Breakpoint Therapeutics, Bristol Myers Squibb, Clovis Oncology, EMD Serono, Foghorn Therapeutics, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, IDEAYA Biosciences, Merck & Co, Pfizer, Rain Therapeutics, Repare Therapeutics, Ryvu Therapeutics, and Tango Therapeutics. In addition, academic and other non-profit organizations have early-stage ongoing drug discovery efforts that target DNA repair, such as Cancer Research UK, University of Chicago, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In addition, to gain market acceptance for our drug candidates, if they are approved for
   commercial sale, we will face competition from numerous companies that are developing novel cancer therapeutics using a variety of modalities other than targeting DNA repair.
Our success will be based upon our ability to advance CYT-0851 and our portfolio of DDR drug candidates through clinical development to regulatory approval and successful commercialization. We believe our therapeutics have the potential to be more tolerable and more effective than competing products in our target indications both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel relative to peer companies in light of the highly competitive market for talent in the biopharmaceutical industry, to obtain and maintain patent protection or otherwise to develop proprietary products and protect and enforce our intellectual property, and to secure sufficient capital to support our research and development efforts in a way that allows us achieve our preclinical and clinical development goals relative to our competitors.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, or are less expensive than our drug candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual property
We strive to obtain, maintain, protect, enforce and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are commercially important to the development of our business, including by seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field.
Our future commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights, in particular our patents rights; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties; and prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our ability to stop unauthorized third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary rights that cover these activities.

   As of February 3, 2022 we owned four issued U.S. patents, one allowed U.S. non-provisional patent application, five pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two pending U.S. provisional patent application, two issued foreign patents, one allowed foreign patent application, 69 pending foreign patent applications, and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications, as detailed in the table below.

 A subset of our patent portfolio relates to CYT-0851 and includes patents and patent applications directed to CYT-0851 and certain methods of use. As of February 3, 2022, we owned three issued U.S. patents, four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two pending U.S. provisional patent applications, two issued foreign patents, one allowed foreign patent application, 47 pending foreign patent applications, and one pending PCT application related to CYT-0851. As of February 3, 2022, we owned one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, and 16 pending foreign patent applications related to CYT-1853. The foregoing patents and patent applications will, if issued, have statutory expiration dates between 2038 and 2042, excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions that may be available.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file patent applications, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in the U.S., in certain instances, a patent term can be extended by a patent term adjustment to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, review period in issuing the patent and/or by patent term extension to account for a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, and a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our owned and licensed pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our owned or licensed patents or whether such claims, if issued, will cover our drug candidates, provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Any issued patents that we may receive or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed, held unenforceable, infringed or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
   We cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our owned or licensed patents and pending patent applications, in part because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries and patent application filings. Accordingly, we may not have been the first to invent the subject matter disclosed in some of our patents and patent applications or the first to file patent applications covering such subject matter.
In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators who are involved in the creation of our technology. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the counterparty. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection, and we cannot guarantee that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.
See “Risk Factors ‒ Risks Related to our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Manufacturing
We currently rely and expect to continue relying on contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to manufacture our drug substances and drug products for preclinical and clinical testing and for future commercial manufacturing of our products. We require the CDMOs manufacturing our drug substances and drug products for clinical testing to comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the required technical, quality, and regulatory oversight over our CDMOs. The development of our analytical methods to control and analyze our products is maintain at a phase appropriate level corresponding to the clinical development. 
Our drug substances are small molecules and our CDMOs manufacture them by synthetic processes from available starting materials. We expect to continue the development of the manufacturing processes of our drug substances at CDMOs and to produce them in a cost-effective manner and meeting all regulatory requirements.
Government regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our drug candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, where we are initially focusing our drug development, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject
   to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies
 •conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
 •completion of the manufacture, under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the sponsor and the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potentially, satisfactory completion of FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
 Preclinical studies and clinical trials for drugs
Before testing any drug in humans, the drug candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the hold and any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A clinical hold can also be imposed once a trial has already begun, thereby halting the trial until the deficiencies articulated by FDA are corrected.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among
   other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may recommend to the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as a lack of observed efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. For example, information about clinical trials, including results for clinical trials other than phase 1 investigations, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, FDA will nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
 •Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. It is common to combine phase 1 and phase 2 studies in oncology drug development. 
 •Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA approval.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing
   the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. marketing approval for drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA package requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications. The marketing application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA must approve an NDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if it believes that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS can include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies like medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling,
   require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Expedited development and review programs for drugs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit.
 A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application. In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review, once an NDA is submitted, if the drug that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is
   reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity
The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and NDA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the phase 3 or phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs.
 A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing marketing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the generation of additional data or the conduct of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved
   in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
 Patent term restoration and extension
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension, or PTE, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. As compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term, which is limited to a maximum of five years, or less if the extended patent term would exceed 14 years after the date of the regulatory approval of the product. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA, less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period and the approval of that application less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or drug product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only extended once based on a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of a patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any PTE or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Marketing exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FD&C Act can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for
   review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FD&C Act alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
In addition, pediatric exclusivity and orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a six-month or seven-year period of exclusivity, respectively, except in certain circumstances.
Regulation of companion diagnostics
Companion diagnostics are diagnostic tests designed to identify patients who may be most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product, identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product, or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic.
 Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer.
 A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control,
   documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s QSR, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities.
 Other regulatory matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of drug candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other healthcare laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
 •The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary, if the person knows or should know it is 

   likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies.
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 •The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which imposes annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Since January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 •Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and relevant federal government compliance guidance; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers; restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts.
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
Coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a drug candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which
   third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasingly used as models for how private and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists, however, among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs.
 Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under the Affordable Care for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Affordable care Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. In On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, including bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation
   designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Although a number of these measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.
 On July 24, 2020, President Trump announced a number of executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the Administration’s proposals, including a policy that would tie Medicare Part B drug prices to international drug prices; one that directs HHS to finalize the Canadian drug importation proposed rule previously issued by HHS and makes other changes allowing for personal importation of drugs from Canada; and one that directs HHS to finalize the rulemaking process on modifying the anti-kickback law safe harbors for plans, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical benefit managers after HHS confirms that the action is not projected to increase federal spending, Medicare beneficiary premiums, or patients’ total out-of-pocket costs. The Biden administration has focused on reforms that would address the high cost of drugs. In response to an Executive Order from President Biden, the Secretary of HHS issued a comprehensive plan for addressing high drug prices that describes a number of legislative approaches and identifies administrative tools to address the high cost of drugs. And Democrats included drug pricing reform provisions reflecting elements of the plan in a broader proposed spending package in late 2021 - such as capping Medicare Part D patients out-of-pocket costs; establishing penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation in Medicare; and authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices on certain, select high cost drugs under Medicare Parts B and D.
 Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
 We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things,
   clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located at 128 Spring St, Building A, Suite 510, Lexington, MA 02421, where we lease and occupy approximately 20,167 square feet of office and laboratory space. The current term of our 128 Spring St. lease expires in 2025.
To meet the future needs of our business, we may lease additional or alternate space, and we believe suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 40 full-time employees. Twenty-one of our employees have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 30 employees are engaged in research and development and 10 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, human resources, and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital priorities and objectives include, as applicable, attracting, recruiting, retaining, and developing our staff. We seek to create and maintain a workplace with an inclusive culture that provides challenging and rewarding work, and creates the opportunity for everyone to contribute their best on behalf of patients and all stakeholders we serve. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to support these objectives, and to recognize staff member performance and align it to the growth and success of the company. Share-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards are extended to selected employees, consultants and directors.
