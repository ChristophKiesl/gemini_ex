Item 1.   Business 
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing, manufacturing and commercializing complex biosimilar therapeutics. Our current focus is on technically challenging and commercially attractive monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, in the disease areas of immunology and oncology. A mAb is a type of protein that is produced by a single clone of cells or cell line and made to bind to a specific substance in the body. Our strategy is to cost-effectively develop these biosimilars on an accelerated timeline, which is fundamental to our success and we believe positions us to be a leading biosimilar company. We have leveraged our team’s biopharmaceutical expertise to establish fully integrated in-house development and manufacturing capabilities, which we refer to as our BioSymphony Platform. We believe this platform addresses the numerous complex technical and regulatory challenges in developing and commercializing mAb biosimilars and was designed to provide significant pricing flexibility. We have identified a pipeline of biosimilar product candidates for further development and have advanced two of these product candidates through Phase 1 clinical trials and into preparations for Phase 3 clinical trials: ONS-3010, a biosimilar to adalimumab (Humira®), and ONS-1045, a biosimilar to bevacizumab (Avastin®). 
 We were founded by a team of industry veterans with decades of cumulative experience in the development and commercialization of biologics products, or biologics. Our leadership team has been instrumental in obtaining global regulatory approval for multiple complex biologics at leading multinational biopharmaceutical companies. In addition, our scientific team has specific experience in process development for complex biologics, protein manufacturing and analytical research and development, which are essential components for the development and manufacturing of complex biosimilars. 
 Escalating healthcare costs and healthcare reform have been major drivers for the advancement of the biosimilar market as payors continue to seek ways to reduce costs. By gaining the “highly similar” regulatory designation for an approved biologic, or reference product, less-expensive biosimilars provide the opportunity to reduce treatment costs without sacrificing the quality of care. We believe the significant pricing flexibility provided by our BioSymphony Platform gives us an additional competitive advantage in potentially capturing market share. The loss of multiple reference product patent exclusivities in the coming years will create significant opportunities for the biosimilar industry. There are more than 30 reference products facing loss of patent exclusivity in one or more major markets through 2020. According to the SNS Report entitled “The Biosimilar Drugs Market: 2015-2030 Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts”, mAbs are the largest segment of the biologic market, and worldwide sales of mAb biosimilars are expected to grow from approximately $1.4 billion in 2015 to $56.5 billion by 2030. 
 Our most advanced product candidate, ONS-3010, an adalimumab (Humira) biosimilar, targets the tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNFα, which is a potent inflammation mediator. In the first quarter of 2015, ONS-3010 met its primary and secondary endpoints in a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, ONS-3010 demonstrated a lower rate of injection site reactions than that of Humira. Our second product candidate, ONS-1045, a bevacizumab (Avastin) biosimilar, interferes with tumor growth by binding to vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, a protein that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels. In October 2015, ONS-1045 met its primary and secondary endpoints in a Phase 1 clinical trial. 
 In addition to our clinical candidates, we have several biosimilar product candidates in development. Our most advanced preclinical product candidate, ONS-1050, a trastuzumab (Herceptin®) biosimilar, interferes with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, a protein that stimulates cell proliferation, and when overexpressed, can cause certain cancers. ONS-4010 is a biosimilar to denosumab (Prolia®/​Xgeva®), which is a fully human mAb with affinity and specificity for human RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand), and used for the treatment of osteoporosis, treatment-induced bone loss, bone metastases and giant cell tumor of the bone. Commencement of Phase 1 clinical trials of ONS-1050 and ONS-4010 are dependent on successful completion of comparative analytical and in vitro functional studies, receipt of necessary regulatory authorizations and additional funding. In addition to these preclinical products, we plan to expand our pipeline of complex biosimilar product candidates as additional products approach the loss of their respective patent exclusivities.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to utilize the BioSymphony Platform to identify, develop, manufacture and commercialize technically challenging and commercially attractive mAb biosimilars on an accelerated timeline in a cost-effective manner, initially in the disease areas of immunology and oncology. In order to achieve this goal, we have adopted a strategy to leverage the BioSymphony Platform and its capabilities to provide funding for our biosimilar development program while we continue to develop our pipeline. The key elements of our strategy include: 
 •

 Maximizing our Biosymphony Model.   We are augmenting our BioSymphony Platform to add capacity and capability to provide contract services beginning in 2019 to provide development and bulk drug manufacturing for development stage biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that this strategy will allow us to fund and achieve commercial readiness for our pipeline of biosimilar product candidates.
 ​
 •

 Rapidly advancing our lead biosimilar product candidates through late-stage clinical development in emerging markets.   We recently outlicensed the remaining emerging markets rights to our most advanced clinical-stage product candidates, ONS-3010 and ONS-1045, and intend to rapidly commercialize these assets with our partner to begin generating revenue in 2020. We believe that this strategy will accelerate the development of our biosimilar pipeline and enhance market awareness of our biosimilar product candidates when we prepare to launch in developed markets.
 ​
 •

 Expanding our pipeline to include innovative mAb candidates.   We plan to initiate development of an innovative mAb candidate in early 2018. We believe that this opportunity can be exploited with a small investment and could potentially begin generating revenues in 2021.
 ​
 •

 Advancing our pre-clinical biosimilar pipeline towards clinical development.   We will continue to build our pipeline of early stage biosimilar product candidates for further development and commercialization. We believe that the long term value of our company will be driven by the launch of multiple biosimilar products from our pipeline.
 ​
 •

 Seeking opportunities to maximize the value of our pre-clinical and clinical pipeline via co-development partnerships and/or licensing the development and commercialization rights where appropriate.   We currently intend to enter into strategic collaborations and partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and other regions. We believe this strategy will allow us to maximize the impact of our financial resources and result in increased commercial value of our development programs.

 The Biosimilar Industry 
 Background 
 Biologic products are produced by living cells and have been approved for the treatment of various disease states. Biosimilars are the approved “copies” of such reference products. According to the EvaluatePharma® report “World Preview 2017, Outlook to 2022” from EVALUATE™ Ltd, the 2016 global biologics market represented approximately $202 billion in sales and the global biologics market is projected to reach $326 billion in sales by 2022, with 52% of the top 100 product sales coming from biologics in 2022. Additionally, according to a recent report from ESPICOM, an international health research and publishing company, more than 280 potential novel biologic therapies have been identified in the clinical pipeline, almost half of which are being evaluated for oncology indications. Multiple patents for many commercially successful biologic products are expected to expire during the next five years, providing an unprecedented opportunity for reductions in the cost of biologics through the introduction of biosimilars. There are over 30 biologic products that face loss of market exclusivity in at least one major market through 2020. Biologic reference products with estimated global sales of $100 billion will come off patent by 2020, and between 2009 and 2019, $50.0 billion of the market value of biologics in the United States alone will lose patent protection. There are currently more than 45 mAbs on the market worldwide, with revenues in excess of $40.0 billion. The overall biosimilar market was projected to reach global sales of approximately $7.8 billion ($2.3 billion of which is associated with mAbs) during 2016, eventually accounting for approximately

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  $118 billion by 2030 ($56.5 billion of which is associated with mAbs). As demonstrated in the following graphic, revenue from global sales of mAbs was expected to account for nearly 29% of the global sales in 2016, with European sales expected to account for 24%.

“The Biosimilar Drugs Market: Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies & Forecasts”; SNS Research Ltd.
 A major driver for the advancement of the biosimilar market is the increasing and disproportionate amount of healthcare spending by governments and private payors on biologic therapeutics. The high costs for biologic treatments have led to an increasing financial burden on these payors. We believe this market dynamic has created opportunities for biosimilar developers in two key respects. First, the high costs of branded biologic products have created a growing demand for lower-cost biosimilars that can offer patients the same benefits as the reference products without sacrificing quality of care. Express Scripts projects U.S.healthcare savings of approximately $250 billion between 2014 and 2024 if biosimilars for just 11 existing biologic drugs that are the most likely candidates for biosimilars were to come to market. Second, because biosimilars, especially complex biosimilars, are more costly and challenging to develop and manufacture than the generic versions of small-molecule drugs, we expect fewer companies will be able to successfully overcome the technical and regulatory complexities of biosimilar development. 
Technical Challenges 
 Unlike small molecules, such as aspirin, or simple biologics, such as human growth hormone, mAbs are much larger and correspondingly complex. MAbs consist of four polypeptide chains of amino acids and perform a vast array of functions within living organisms. The specific amino acid sequence of each mAb dictates the folding of the protein into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. The following image compares a mAb to human growth hormone and aspirin. The complexity of a molecule increases with its size as defined by molecular weight, or number of atoms. 
 
MAbs are derived from living cells and are produced through a series of complex processing steps that define their overall structure. Accordingly, they cannot be chemically synthesized nor fully characterized by a few analytical techniques. MAbs are also known to contain sugar side-chains, which are attached through a process referred to as glycosylation. These sugar chains confer structural stability, improve solubility, and can impact the function of the protein in vivo.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The complexities of mAbs require a specialized skill set for development. A biosimilar developer must have the necessary expertise in cell and molecular biology, protein biochemistry and biochemical engineering to overcome the following particular technical challenges: 
 •

 Reference Product:   A protein therapeutic exists as a mixture of various molecular forms that together impart its mechanism of action. In order to understand the structure and function of the reference product, the biosimilar developer must conduct many analytical studies to reverse engineer the multiple quality attributes that govern the reference product’s protein structure and function. Due to the inherent variability that results from cellular production techniques, many production lots of reference product must be analyzed to understand the batch to batch variability and set the target product profile for the biosimilar candidate. 
 ​
 •

 Similarity:   Biosimilar developers must create their own cell line and unique manufacturing process as they do not have access to the reference product manufacturer’s cell lines or manufacturing know-how. As a result, only similar, but not exact, copies of the reference product are feasible. During production, mAbs commonly can degrade to form aggregates, when two or more mAb units bind to each other to form larger structures. These larger structures can lead to changes in activity, or immunogenicity (provoke an immune response). Finally, mAbs may also undergo other chemical degradation events during purification and during storage, each of which can impact potency. Producing biomolecules that are highly similar to the reference product requires a significant interdisciplinary effort that involves a number of iterative cycles between cell line and process development, and analytical characterization. 
 ​
 •

 Manufacturing:   The quality profile of a biologic can change when the manufacturing process scale is increased to commercial size or when processes are modified to fit a facility. The ability to manufacture highly similar molecules must be demonstrated reproducibly at commercial scale. In order to enable pricing flexibility, the manufacturer must minimize costs related to depreciation of its capital investment, raw materials and operations, while maintaining high quality and yield. 
 ​
 Regulatory Challenges 
 The regulatory requirements for the development of biosimilars in many countries, including the United States, Canada, the European Union, or EU and Japan, differ from the requirements for developing the reference products. For example, the analytical data package required to initiate clinical trials of biosimilars is more exhaustive due to the prerequisite to generate initial similarity data to the reference product. This process requires multiple qualified methods to ensure that the data generated for similarity testing are reproducible and comprehensive. On the other hand, the non-clinical and clinical programs for biosimilars tend to be more streamlined than for innovator molecules if shown to be analytically similar at the outset and can be supported by the reference product data. The regulatory expectations surrounding biosimilars are still evolving as new draft and final guidance documents are being made public across regulatory authorities. 
 Regulatory hurdles associated with biosimilar development include: 
 •

 demonstrating to regulators that specific analytical differences of the biosimilar do not have clinical impact; 
 ​
 •

 complying with individual regulatory authority requirements for in vivo preclinical studies to enable development and registration in planned markets; 
 ​
 •

 anticipating and responding to changes in regulatory requirements that could involve additional technical work; 
 ​
 •

 demonstrating extrapolation for an indication that can drive market share; 
 ​
 •

 addressing questions during regulatory review of marketing applications to prevent a delay in approval; and 
 ​
 •

 designing global clinical trials to meet the different regulatory requirements to avoid duplicative studies and additional expense.

  Any deficiency in regulatory approach could result in inconsistencies in the final data package for the submission and could lead to a delay or rejection of a product candidate’s approval in certain markets. 
Our BioSymphony Platform 
 Escalating healthcare costs and healthcare reform initiatives have been major drivers for the advancement of the biosimilar market. Our BioSymphony Platform is designed to address the technical challenges and regulatory dynamics of the complex biologics industry by developing high quality mAb biosimilars on an accelerated timeline and in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The BioSymphony Platform, driven by our entrepreneurial culture, leverages our fully integrated in-house 48,000 square foot development and manufacturing facility and our team’s clinical and regulatory expertise. We believe this model enables significant pricing flexibility, providing us with competitive advantages, and positions us to be a leading biosimilar company. The key elements of our BioSymphony Platform are depicted in the following figure. 
 
MAb development presents high technical hurdles, and the success of our development efforts is dependent on an experienced and knowledgeable workforce. We were founded by a team of industry veterans with decades of cumulative experience in biologics development and commercialization. Our team has been instrumental in obtaining global regulatory approval for multiple complex biologics at leading multinational biopharmaceutical companies. We have hired accomplished scientists, engineers and business leaders since our inception, who together foster an entrepreneurial culture that has enabled agility, teamwork and rapid decision-making at Oncobiologics. Together, this has resulted in a highly collaborative approach, which has been critical to the efficient and sustainable operation of our BioSymphony Platform. 
 Technical Platform 
 In-House CMC Development Capabilities 
 We have established a research and development laboratory, which we believe enables the rapid development of high-quality mAb biosimilars. By establishing this infrastructure in-house, we have shortened the typical time required to perform the mandatory interdisciplinary iterative steps to develop mAb biosimilar products, which we believe reduces the cost of development. Our platform provides us with a differentiated approach to the following compulsory steps required to develop biosimilars: 

 5

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  •

 Reference Product Characterization and Cell Line Development:   We initially reverse engineer the amino acid sequence and identify the critical quality attributes of the reference product that in turn provides the criteria for the clone selection process. We utilize automated technologies to enable thousands of clones to be screened in an accelerated timeline. 
 ​
 •

 Bioprocess:   We utilize high-throughput mini bioreactors to assess the screened clones and media components to determine which clone and bioreaction process will produce a biosimilar candidate with the closest match to the reference product. We have developed purification technology, including a platform of chromatography techniques that are strategically combined to maximize product-yield while meeting the critical quality attributes of the reference product. 
 ​
 •

 Formulation:   The formulation that best preserves the stability of the biosimilar candidate may be different than the actual formulation of the reference product. We use high-throughput techniques to screen and evaluate many formulation variations to identify the most effective stable formulation. 
 ​
 •

 Analytical Characterization and in vitro Similarity:   We utilize numerous advanced analytical techniques and instruments to enable us to interpret the chemical and structural similarity between our biosimilar candidate and the reference product. We apply a rigorous analytical approach to characterize attributes such as structure (primary, secondary and tertiary), size and glycosylation, among others. We test up to approximately 60 quality attributes with approximately 45 analytical methods. The biological characterization assays support establishing the in vitro similarity. Our in-house capabilities provide an expeditious and thorough assessment of biochemical, biophysical and functional attributes. 
 ​
 To pursue development and commercialization of additional mAb biosimilar candidates, we plan to build-out additional state-of-the-art development infrastructure, which we will occupy in phases as needed. Our plan is to add to our scientific team as our development programs expand.
 In-House Manufacturing Capability
 We have established a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility capable of simultaneously producing multiple biosimilar candidates. Our manufacturing platform utilizes single-use technology, including the use of the largest single-use bioreactor available, which eliminates the need for rigorous cleaning and sterilization procedures, and related operational requirements necessary for manufacture in traditional stainless-steel based facilities. We have been able to construct single-use based antibody manufacturing plants in approximately four months as compared to the few years required for de novo biotechnology manufacturing facilities. We have developed and execute a quality system that meets U.S. and EU standards and have successfully completed two Qualified Person, or QP, audits resulting in cGMP declaration for both Phase 1 and Phase 3 manufacturing. We plan to expand the manufacturing capacity in our current location in 2018 to support our new contract development and manufacturing business and our future pipeline needs. 
 Development-Manufacturing Integration 
 We believe we have successfully and seamlessly unified our development capabilities and manufacturing processes to minimize time lapses and risks that are frequently encountered in drug development. Our internal processes eliminate the need to transfer technology and processes to third-party manufacturers. Technology transfers are commonly performed through formal procedures consisting of the transfer of know-how, followed by manufacturing process gap assessments, and then finally replication and scale-up of the development process at manufacturing scale. These technology-transfer proceedings can take upwards of six months or longer, and could have an adverse effect on product quality. Our platform gives us the ability to initiate manufacturing within approximately six weeks of process development completion. 
 Regulatory and Clinical Approach for a Successful Global Launch 
 The regulatory requirements for the development of complex biosimilars are significantly different from those for novel biologic therapeutics. These biosimilar regulatory expectations are still evolving with new drafts and final guidance being made public by regulatory authorities worldwide. Due to the limited number

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  of biosimilar regulatory approvals and developing guidance, prior regulatory feedback may not reflect the current expectations of the applicable regulatory authorities. We have developed a global regulatory risk mitigation strategy that we believe allows us to ask the right questions at the right time, enables us to ask probing questions to explore regulatory boundaries, provides the potential to set precedence and assures alignment with regulatory authorities. We believe the key prongs to this strategy include: checking in at certain key milestones to confirm continued acceptability, adjusting our programs with an understanding of evolving requirements, approaching key health authority agencies to discuss development plans and reviewing regulatory guidance and published information. 
 Our interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, provide us with a better understanding of relevant regulatory requirements and build our overall regulatory knowledge base for other upcoming product candidates. We augment these interactions by meeting with key health authorities, selected based on known expertise with biotechnology products or the established rapporteur to the reference product. These additional interactions are used to provide national input for risk mitigation for the clinical trial applications and also additional expert input on our development programs. This knowledge creates efficiencies in our development program by reducing the need to duplicate experiments or clinical trials. We have retained regulatory consultants in other countries to obtain advice on how to approach the regulatory agencies to optimally design our global development plans to meet the relevant local and regional regulatory requirements. 
 An important aspect of our regulatory development strategy is to design our confirmatory trials to maximize the potential commercial success in order to meet the requirements for extrapolation to other indications and to enable us to seek an interchangeability designation for at least some of our current and future product candidates. Our goal is to develop trial designs that will enable us to extrapolate to all approved indications without additional clinical data. We will also assess the ability for our product candidates that are either self-administered or used chronically in order to seek an interchangeability designation, which allows substitution for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product. We may also develop trial designs to demonstrate clinical advantages of our biosimilar product candidates over reference products. 
 Data from in vivo animal studies may not be required to initiate human clinical trials for biosimilars, and as such we only conduct animal studies if it is deemed necessary to meet regulatory requirements or to address safety questions. Our approach to confirm that there is no clinically meaningful impact of any observed analytical differences is to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, followed by a single Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial in a sensitive population. Based on regulatory guidance as well as our recent interactions with regulatory bodies, we believe this approach will continue to be acceptable to the regulatory bodies. Because regulatory bodies generally do not require a repeat of the original efficacy and safety trials, we continue to explore the potential of novel approaches to trial design that can confirm similarity in shorter duration of treatment and/or with smaller patient numbers, which can result in shortened timelines to registration. In certain cases, we may even be able to demonstrate that our biosimilar product candidates are more effective or safer than the reference products. 
 Our People and Culture 
 MAb development presents high technical hurdles, and the success of our development efforts is dependent on an experienced and knowledgeable work-force. We were founded by a team of industry veterans, with decades of cumulative experience in biologics development and commercialization at some of the leading biopharmaceutical companies including Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, and Genentech, Inc. Our leadership team has built a platform with the goal of expeditiously identifying, developing, manufacturing and commercializing mAb biosimilars in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We have fostered a culture of agility, collaboration and efficient decision-making with a focus on scientific rigor, which we believe forms the core of our BioSymphony Platform.

  BioSymphony Contract Development and Manufacturing (CDM) Program
 In 2018, we plan to expand the capacity and capabilities of our BioSymphony Platform to accelerate and maximize commercial revenues from our core expertise in drug development and manufacturing. With the completion of this expansion, we expect to begin generating commercial revenue in 2019 to cover the basic operating costs of running our business, which will allow us to use any funds generated from our partnerships or other transactions for investment directly in our development pipeline.
 The initial focus of the CDM Program will be to assist development stage biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with the development and manufacturing of their drug product candidates for clinical trials. We believe that we will be able to provide a flexible and cost effective alternative to the larger contract manufacturing organizations currently serving this market.
 Our Product Candidate Portfolio 
 We are currently developing a portfolio of commercially attractive mAb biosimilars, for which the corresponding reference products generated an aggregate of over $40 billion in global revenue in 2016. Our strategy is to develop our early stage biosimilar product candidates to the point of lab scale similarity and only move ahead into clinical trials with a licensing or co-development partner. Similarly, we intend to only move our most advanced biosimilar product candidates into Phase 3 clinical trials with the help of a licensing and/or co-development partner.
 We selected the product candidates in our pipeline on the basis of an internal evaluation process that relies on a weighted criteria comprised of the following factors: 
 (i)

 future commercial potential; 
 ​
 (ii)

 alignment of the reference product’s patent expiry against the requisite development timelines; 
 ​
 (iii)

 probability of technical success; and 
 ​
 (iv)

 global competitive landscape.
 ​
 In addition to our biosimilar product candidates, we are planning to begin development and complete proof-of-concept testing in 2018 for ONS-5010, an innovative mAb we will develop using the BioSymphony Platform.
 The most advanced mAb biosimilars in our pipeline are described in the following chart.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  ONS-3010 — Adalimumab (Humira) Biosimilar 
 Humira, the reference product for ONS-3010, is a subcutaneous injectable mAb that binds to TNFα. TNFα belongs to a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or soluble protein mediators, that are key initiators of immune-mediated inflammation in many different diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Several biologic agents, including Humira, have been developed to inhibit the inflammatory activity of TNFs in the context of these diseases and are collectively referred to as the anti-TNF class of therapeutics. 
Market Opportunity 
 Worldwide sales of Humira were $16.1 billion in 2016, with approximately $10.4 billion in the United States and projected to grow to $20.0 billion worldwide by 2020, and it is one of the world’s bestselling drugs. 
 Humira has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of 10 and 12 indications, respectively. Humira is currently approved in the United States for the following indications: rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, adult Crohn’s disease, pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa and uveitis. We initially intend to seek approval of ONS-3010, a subcutaneous injectable, for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, and will pursue extrapolation of ONS-3010 across all eligible approved indications in order to maximize the commercial potential for ONS-3010. We have also designed our Phase 3 clinical trial for ONS-3010 in a way that we believe will enable us to also seek an interchangeability designation in the United States and have reviewed our trial design with the FDA and the EMA. 
 Chemistry Manufacturing Controls, or CMC, Status 
 We have manufactured and characterized a master cell bank from a selected clone and demonstrated its stability in accordance with global regulatory guidelines. We have also completed development of the ONS-3010 commercial manufacturing process. A novel formulation of similar stability was developed and used in the Phase 1 clinical trial and this same formulation is expected to be used for a planned Phase 3 clinical trial. 
 We have confirmed that the amino acid sequence of ONS-3010 matches Humira. Extensive analytical characterization and in vitro studies comparing ONS-3010 to both the U.S. and the EU versions of Humira were completed and a representative overlay demonstrating equivalent potency is shown in the following figure. Luminescence is a highly sensitive method for assaying cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Potency is measured based on a comparison of the dose dependent response of the test article to the reference article. Based on the result of this assay and numerous analytical and in vitro characterization data, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess pharmacokinetics, or PK, and safety. PK means how the body affects the molecule.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Clinical Development Status and Clinical Trial Data 
 We have successfully completed a randomized, double-blind, single-dose and single-center Phase 1 clinical trial comparing ONS-3010 to Humira in 198 subjects receiving a 40 mg dose in three treatment arms: ONS-3010, U.S.-Humira and EU-Humira. This Phase 1 clinical trial was performed at the Center for Human Drug Research in Leiden, The Netherlands under the auspices of the Stichting Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek. In this trial, ONS-3010 met its primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating a similar PK profile, as well as an immunogenicity profile equivalent to both U.S. - and EU-Humira across all three treatment arms. ONS-3010 was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile, which was similar to the safety profile for both U.S.- and EU-Humira, and demonstrated a lower injection site reaction rate than both U.S.- and EU-Humira. The following figure demonstrates the mean concentration-time profile of U.S.-Humira, EU-Humira and ONS-3010. The vertical line at day one denotes dosing. These results suggest a high degree of similarity between the three products. 
Primary PK Endpoint (AUC0-∞)
 
The following figure demonstrates the effect of anti-drug antibodies on the concentrations (AUC, or area under the curve) for the three products. There were no significant differences in either the amount of anti-drug antibodies formed or their effect on concentration between the three products, which again suggest a high degree of similarity between the three products.

Regulatory Status and Development Plan 
 Prior to commencement of our Phase 1 clinical trial in 2014, we received feedback from both FDA and EMA, which provided guidance for the design of the clinical trial and our similarity testing approach. Since completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, we had additional regulatory meetings with the FDA and the EMA, as well as other national regulatory agencies such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, and the Swedish regulatory authority, and obtained further guidance on the Phase 3 clinical trial design in plaque psoriasis and the general similarity development plan for registration. We have completed a site feasibility study to identify global sites (North and South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand) in preparation for the commencement of our planned Phase 3 clinical trial. 
ONS-1045 — Bevacizumab (Avastin) Biosimilar 
 Avastin, the reference product for ONS-1045, is a mAb administered by infusion that interferes with tumor growth by binding to VEGF, a protein that stimulates the formation of new blood vessels. 
Market Opportunity 
 Worldwide sales of Avastin were approximately $7.5 billion in 2016 and are projected to remain relatively flat through 2019. Avastin has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of seven and eight indications, respectively. Avastin is currently approved in the United States for the following indications: metastatic colorectal cancer, with intravenous 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for first- or second-line treatment; metastatic colorectal cancer, with fluoropyrimidine- irinotecan- or fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for second-line treatment in patients who have progressed on a first-line Avastin containing regimen; non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, with carboplatin and paclitaxel for first line treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease; glioblastoma, as a single agent for adult patients with progressive disease following prior therapy; metastatic renal cell carcinoma with interferon alfa; cervical cancer, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or paclitaxel and topotecan in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic disease; platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, in combination with paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan. We initially intend to seek approval of ONS-1045, which will be delivered by infusion, for the treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and will pursue extrapolation across all approved indications, in order to maximize the commercial potential for ONS-1045. 
 CMC Status 
 We have manufactured and characterized a master cell bank from a selected clone and demonstrated its stability in accordance with global regulatory guidelines. In addition, we have completed development of the ONS-1045 commercial manufacturing process. 
 We have confirmed that the amino acid sequence of ONS-1045 matches Avastin. Extensive analytical characterization and in vitro studies comparing ONS-1045 to both the U.S. and the EU-Avastin were completed and a representative overlay demonstrating equivalent potency is shown in the following figure.

In preparation for producing Phase 3 clinical supplies, we are manufacturing ONS-1045 using our commercial scale process at our manufacturing facility. These batches will be filled into vials at a contracted U.S.-based commercial fill-finish facility. 
Clinical Development 
 We have completed a randomized, double-blind, single-dose and single-center Phase 1 clinical trial comparing ONS-1045 to U.S.-licensed Avastin and EU-licensed Avastin in 135 subjects. This Phase 1 trial was performed at the Center for Human Drug Research in Leiden, The Netherlands under the auspices of the Stichting Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek. PK data, safety and immunogenicity were collected for a total of 98 days after a single 2.0 mg/kg dose. In this trial, ONS-1045 met its primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a similar PK profile, as well as an immunogenicity profile equivalent to both U.S.- and EU-Avastin. Safety was comparable across all three groups. Immunogenicity was low with only one subject in the EU-licensed Avastin arm developing an anti-drug antibody, or ADA, at day 98. No neutralizing antibodies were detected in any arm. The following figure demonstrates the concentration-time profile of ONS-1045, U.S.-licensed Avastin, and EU-licensed Avastin as the mean. The vertical line at time zero denotes dosing. These results suggest a high degree of similarity between the three products.

Regulatory Status and Development Plan
 Prior to the commencement of a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2015, we received feedback from both the FDA and the EMA, which provided guidance for the clinical trial design and similarity testing approach. We have 

 12

  completed the next series of our regulatory interactions to obtain further guidance on our confirmatory trial design. Based on input from the FDA, EMA, MHRA and the Danish Health and Medicines Agency, we believe we have designed the appropriate confirmatory trial.
ONS-1050 — Trastuzumab (Herceptin) Biosimilar 
 Trastuzumab (Herceptin), the reference product for ONS-1050, is a mAb administered by infusion that binds to HER2. Herceptin has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2. 
Market Opportunity 
 According to the Roche Annual Report for 2016, worldwide sales of Herceptin totaled approximately $7.5 billion in 2016. Herceptin is currently approved for HER2+ breast cancer and HER2+ metastatic gastric cancer in both the United States and the EU, as well as HER2+ gastroesophageal junction cancer in the United States. Worldwide sales of Herceptin grew approximately 3% in the first half of 2017. We have not yet determined the indication for which we will initially seek approval of ONS-1050. However, we will pursue extrapolation of ONS-1050 across all approved indications, in order to maximize the commercial potential for ONS-1050, and will deliver ONS-1050 by infusion. 
 CMC Status 
 A clone with a highly similar profile to Herceptin has been chosen for further process development. We have demonstrated the stability of the cell line, and characterization of the master cell bank. Manufacturing process development for ONS-1050 is nearing completion. We have confirmed that the amino acid sequence of ONS-1050 matches Herceptin. Extensive analytical characterization and in vitro functionality studies comparing ONS-1050 to Herceptin are underway and expected to support the biosimilarity assessment required to initiate clinical trials. A representative overlay demonstrating equivalent potency of ONS-1050 to U.S. and EU-Herceptin is shown in the following figure. 
 Comparative Potency of ONS-1050 versus Herceptin (U.S. and EU).

We are planning to manufacture ONS-1050 for a Phase 1 PK study using our commercial scale process at our manufacturing facility. This batch is expected to be vialed at a U.S. pharmaceutical filling facility. 
 Regulatory Status and Development Plans 
 We received initial EMA guidance in the second quarter 2014 that supports our approach to the initial Phase 1 trial design. In accordance with our regulatory strategy and in advance of initiating Phase 1 clinical trials, we plan to interact with FDA, as well as other national regulatory agencies such as MHRA and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, to also obtain further guidance on study design. We expect to be ready to commence our Phase 1 clinical trial upon securing either a co-development or licensing partner for ONS-1050 or additional funding.

  Preclinical Biosimilar Pipeline 
 In addition to the product candidates we are currently advancing through clinical development, we are leveraging our BioSymphony Platform to develop additional preclinical candidates. Further development of such preclinical product candidates is subject to ongoing commercial analysis, among other items. We have not yet determined the initial indications for which we will seek approval for such preclinical product candidates. Our strategy will be to seek initial approval for an approved indication of the reference product, which will be determined in consultation with regulatory authorities regarding clinical trial and study design, and then seek to expand such approval to the same indications as the reference product. We also intend to deliver our biosimilars in the same manner as the reference product. 
 We have developed cell lines and completed clone selection for ONS-4010, a biosimilar to denosumab (Prolia/Xgeva). Denosumab is a fully human mAb with affinity and specificity for human RANKL. Prolia is a subcutaneous injectable currently approved in the United States for treatment (i) of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, (ii) to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, (iii) to increase bone mass in men at high risk for fracture receiving androgen deprivation therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer and (iv) to increase bone mass in women at high risk for fracture receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer. Xgeva is a subcutaneous injectable currently approved in the United States for prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy. We have completed preliminary characterization and the reverse engineering of the amino acid sequences of the reference product. According to manufacturers’ reports and recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 2016 worldwide sales of Prolia/Xgeva were approximately $3.2 billion. 
 Additionally, ONS-3040, a biosimilar to ustekinumab (Stelara®), is in early stage development. According to manufacturers’ reports, 2016 worldwide sales of Stelara were $3.2 billion. We are focused on reverse engineering the reference product characteristics and developing cell lines for clone selection. In 2018, we anticipate completing reference product characterization for ONS-3040. We continue to evaluate other biosimilar product candidates for our pipeline pending additional interest from potential development partners.
 ONS-5010 — Innovative mAB Drug Product Candidate
 We have been presented with an opportunity to utilize our expertise and capabilities in developing and manufacturing mAb biosimilars to develop and commercialize an innovative mAb biotherapeutic for a significant patient population. Our intent is to request and receive feedback from regulatory authorities in early 2018 and, if positive, proceed into Phase 1 clinical trials later in 2018. The innovative ONS-5010 development program is being designed to potentially begin generating revenues by 2021.
Commercialization, Sales and Marketing 
 Our commercialization strategy is to maximize the revenue potential of our biosimilar product candidates along with seeking and securing licensing opportunities to fund the development of our assets. We currently intend to enter into strategic collaborations and partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and other regions to maximize the commercial value of our pipeline. Our intent is to enter into partnerships that result in economic and transactional efficiencies by including upfront and post-Phase 1 development payments that would, in large part, offset global Phase 3 clinical development costs for each biosimilar product candidate. For example, we have a joint participation agreement in place for ONS-3010 with Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Huahai, whereby we share post-Phase 1 development costs with Huahai, and proportionately share the revenues from commercialization of ONS-3010 in the United States, Canada, EU, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. We could also be required to form a joint venture to further develop and commercialize ONS-3010 with Huahai in the agreed countries, if so requested by Huahai. However, we do not have any other development and commercialization agreements for the United States or for major ex-U.S. markets, such as the EU and Japan.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  For emerging markets opportunities, in 2012 and 2013, we established early country-specific partnerships for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in China with Huahai, in India with IPCA Laboratories Limited, or IPCA, and in Mexico with Laboratories Liomont, S.A. de C.V., or Liomont, and in September 2017 we entered into an agreement with GMS Tenshi Holdings Pte. Limited, or GMS Tenshi, providing for the license of rights to ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in emerging markets excluding China, India and Mexico. In each of these smaller ex-U.S. markets, we have identified potential synergies between our partner’s strategy to enter the biologics marketplace and access to our biosimilar development platform. For many of these emerging market opportunities, our partners may be able to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements that could allow us to begin generating sales as early as 2020, before we begin to generate commercial revenue in regions like the United States, the EU and Japan.
 The United States and the EU are expected to be the largest and economically most attractive biosimilar markets and we plan to actively pursue licensing partners for both the United States and the EU. If required, we intend to build our commercialization infrastructure through an option to outsource the sales and marketing work force via a contract sales organization. As such, we have engaged a consulting company to evaluate our options and to assist with the development of a U.S. sales and marketing strategy. We have also entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Premier Healthcare Alliance, L.P., or Premier, a developer of a network of U.S. hospitals and healthcare providers, focused on data-gathering and cost-reduction strategies to improve the outcome of its members. 
 Under the agreement, we are partnering with Premier to share knowledge and strategize about how to most efficiently deliver our innovative and cost-effective mAb biosimilars in the U.S. market. We currently focus on those critical success factors associated with commercial success, namely the identification and interactions between (i) payors, (ii) providers, (iii) pharmacy benefit management organizations, (iv) patients and (v) physicians. We are currently developing a strategic roadmap that entails (i) developing and validating our commercialization strategy; (ii) exploring/establishing a distribution and commercialization relationship; and (iii) eventually developing our own sales and marketing force.
 We believe that the U.S. biosimilar market adoption and penetration rates for each biosimilar will be determined primarily by four key factors: (1) the prevalence of payor incentives to drive substitution, (2) the physician and patient share influence relative to the payor in the prescribing decision, (3) rapidity of feedback on the safety and efficacy of the drug based on the totality of the patient response and (4) patient criticality (the degree of severity in the patient’s condition). 
 Collaboration and License Agreements 
 We enter into collaboration and license agreements in the ordinary course of our business. We have in-licensed certain technology from Selexis SA, or Selexis, that we are using to research and develop our biosimilar product candidates. For biosimilar product candidates developed using the Selexis technology, we enter into commercial license agreements with Selexis that give us rights to commercialize, file investigational new drugs, or INDs and enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties for the further development and commercialization of such biosimilar product candidates. Our commercialization strategy is to potentially retain U.S. rights to select biosimilar product candidates while entering into additional strategic collaborations and partnerships in other regions to maximize the commercial value of our pipeline. Although we do not yet have any such agreements for major ex-U.S. markets, such as the EU or Japan, we have licensing and collaboration agreements with select partners for smaller ex-U.S. markets where we would not otherwise intend to commercialize our biosimilar product candidates, including India, Mexico and China, which agreements have collectively provided an aggregate of $29.0 million in payments as of September 30, 2017. 
Selexis — Humira (ONS-3010), Avastin (ONS-1045) and Herceptin (ONS-1050) 
 In October 2011, we entered into a research license agreement with Selexis pursuant to which we acquired a non-exclusive license to conduct research internally or in collaboration with third parties to develop recombinant proteins from mammalian cells lines created using the Selexis expression technology, or the Selexis Technology. The original research license had a three-year term, but on October 9, 2014, was extended for an additional three-year term through October 9, 2017. We are currently in discussions with Selexis to extend the research license for an additional year. We may sublicense our rights with Selexis’ prior 

 15

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  written consent but are prohibited from making commercial use of the Selexis Technology or the resultant recombinant proteins comprising our biosimilars in humans, or from filing an IND, absent a commercial license agreement with Selexis covering the particular biosimilar product candidate developed under the research license. 
 In connection with the entry into the research license, we paid Selexis an initial fee of CHF 100,000 (approximately $0.1 million) and agreed to make additional annual maintenance payments of the same amount for each of the three years that the research license agreement term was extended. We expect that we will need to pay Selexis a similar amount in connection with the further extension one-year extension of the research license that we are currently negotiating. As of September 30, 2017, we have paid Selexis an aggregate of approximately $0.6 million under the research license agreement. 
 Selexis also granted us a non-transferrable option to obtain a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide commercial license under the Selexis Technology to manufacture, or have manufactured, a recombinant protein produced by a cell line developed using the Selexis Technology for clinical testing and commercial sale. We exercised this option in April 2013 and entered into three commercial license agreements as described more fully below. 
 Either party may terminate the research license in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the other party becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, winding up or similar circumstances. Either party may terminate the research license under designated circumstances if the Selexis Technology infringes third party proprietary rights. Although we have the right to terminate the research license at any time for our convenience, we agreed with our other collaborator parties to whom we have sublicensed the Selexis Technology not to exercise such right without their consent, which agreements are described below. 
 Commercial License Agreements 
 On April 11, 2013, following the exercise of our option to enter a commercial license under the Selexis research license, we entered into commercial license agreements with Selexis for each of the ONS-3010, ONS-1045 and ONS-1050 biosimilar product candidates that were developed under the research license (which agreements were subsequently amended on May 21, 2014). Under the terms of each commercial license agreement, we acquired a non-exclusive worldwide license under the Selexis Technology to use the cell lines developed under the research license and related materials, to manufacture and commercialize licensed and final products, with a limited right to sublicense. 
 We were required to pay an upfront licensing fee of CHF 65,000 (approximately $0.1 million) to Selexis for each commercial license and also agreed to pay up to CHF 365,000 (approximately $0.4 million) in milestone payments for each licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay a single-digit royalty on a final product-by-final product and country-by-country basis, based on worldwide net sales of such final products by us or any of our affiliates or sublicensees during the royalty term. The royalty term for each final product in each country is the period commencing from the first commercial sale of the applicable final product in the applicable country and ending on the expiration of the specified patent coverage. At any time during the term, we have the right to terminate our royalty payment obligation by providing written notice to Selexis and paying Selexis a royalty termination fee of CHF 1,750,000 (approximately $1.8 million). As of September 30, 2017, we have paid Selexis an aggregate of approximately $0.3 million under the commercial license agreements. 
 Each of our commercial agreements with Selexis will expire in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable Selexis patent rights. The licensed patent rights consist of two patent families. The first patent family relates to methods of transferring cells, and is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and Singapore. This patent family will begin to expire worldwide in 2022. The second patent family claims DNA compositions of matter useful for having protein production increasing activity. This patent family is filed in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia, Singapore and South Africa. This patent family will begin to expire worldwide in 2025. Either party may terminate the related agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the other party becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, winding up or similar circumstances. 

 16

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Either party may also terminate the related agreement under designated circumstances if the Selexis Technology infringes third-party intellectual property rights. In addition, we have the right to terminate each of the commercial agreements at any time for our convenience; however, with respect to the agreements relating to ONS-3010 and ONS-1045, this right is subject to Liomont’s consent pursuant to a corresponding letter we executed in conjunction with the standby agreement entered into between Selexis and Liomont on November 11, 2014. The standby agreement permits Liomont to assume the license under the applicable commercial agreement for Mexico upon specified triggering events involving our bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. 
 Ex-U.S. Collaboration and License Agreements 
 Aside from our joint participation agreement in place for ONS-3010 with Huahai, whereby we agreed to share post-Phase 1 development costs, and proportionately share the revenues from commercialization of ONS-3010 in the United States, Canada, EU and Japan, among other markets, and under which we could be required to form a joint venture with Huahai for ONS-3010 if so requested by Huahai, we do not have any commercial license or development agreements for the United States or for major ex-U.S. markets, such as the EU or Japan. We currently have collaboration and license agreements for smaller ex-U.S. markets and, collectively, such agreements have provided an aggregate of $29.0 million in payments as of September 30, 2017 for our most advanced biosimilar product candidates. Our contracts include agreements with IPCA (for ONS-3010, ONS-1045 and ONS-1050 in India and other regional markets), Liomont (for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in Mexico), Huahai (for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in China) and GMS Tenshi (for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045 in emerging markets excluding China, India and Mexico). Our arrangements with these partners generally include a strategic license for a defined territory for agreed biosimilar product candidates, and may also include agreements to assist with research and development to assist our contract counterparty in establishing their own mAb research, development and manufacturing capabilities. Under our existing strategic licensing agreements, we generally received an upfront payment upon execution, and have the ability to earn additional regular milestone payments and the right to receive royalties (generally a mid-single digit to low-teens percentage rate) based on net sales in the agreed territory. Our existing agreements to assist with research and development also included an upfront payment upon execution, and we have the ability to earn additional regular milestone payments, and the right to receive royalties (generally a mid-single digit to low-teens percentage rate) based on net sales in the agreed territory. 
 Generally, our agreements expire on a product-by-product basis on the date of the expiration of the royalty revenue term for all products in the territory. The royalty revenue term is 10 years from the date of first commercial sale and any renewal is subject to good faith negotiation. The license term for the agreed territory is perpetual. Either party may terminate the agreement in its entirety or with respect to a particular product if the other party materially breaches the agreement, subject to specified notice and cure periods. In addition, we have the right to terminate the agreement in connection with any interference, opposition or challenge of our patent rights. If the agreement is terminated due to our breach, our contract counterparty is generally free to use all applicable technology and know-how that we have provided under the agreement. 
 As noted above, our collaboration agreements with Huahai also includes a joint participation agreement, which provides for the co-funding of development of ONS-3010 in the United States, Canada, EU, Japan, Australia and New Zealand and the proportionate sharing of the revenues from commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries, and also provides for the formation of a joint venture with Huahai to further develop and commercialize ONS-3010 with Huahai in the agreed countries, if so requested by Huahai. 
 In the event Huahai funds its proportionate share of development costs incurred after completion of the “Phase-3 Ready Package,” Huahai would be entitled to retain its 51% value ownership, with us entitled to retain our 49% value ownership, of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries. Similarly, revenues from the commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries (including major markets such as the United States and the EU, among others), would also be shared based on such proportional ownership interests. In the event that Huahai does not fund its proportionate share of such development costs, the joint participation agreement provides for a proportionate adjustment to our respective value ownership interests based on our respective investments in such development costs, which would increase our value ownership interest in ONS-3010. 

 17

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Throughout the term of the joint participation agreement, we and our affiliates are prohibited from, directly or indirectly, conducting or having conducted or funding any discovery, research, development, regulatory, manufacturing or commercialization activity, alone or in collaboration with a third party, of any biosimilar product having the same reference product as the ONS-3010 compound or corresponding products, for use in the United States, Canada, EU, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, other than ONS-3010 with Huahai pursuant to the joint participation agreement. 
 Unless terminated early upon mutual agreement of the parties, or due to a material breach of either party that is uncured, the joint participation agreement will terminate upon entry into a mutually acceptable collaboration agreement between us and Huahai for ongoing development and commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries, or we and Huahai enter into an agreed license with a third party for such ongoing development and commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries. If the joint participation agreement is terminated for cause due to our breach, we could be required to refund Huahai any amounts funded by Huahai to develop ONS-3010, as well as pay Huahai a 6% royalty on net sales made by us or an affiliate, as well as 25% of revenues we receive from a sublicensee for commercial sales of ONS-3010 until the aggregate of such payments is equal to 10 times the amount Huahai funded for the development of ONS-3010. 
 Furthermore, if we were to file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or have an involuntary petition filed that we could not dismiss within 120 days, then Huahai would be granted an exclusive license to continue the development and commercialization of ONS-3010 in the agreed countries. 
 As of September 30, 2017, we have received an aggregate of $5.0 million of payments from IPCA under our various agreements, an aggregate of $3.0 million of payments from Liomont under our various agreements, an aggregate of $16.0 million of payments from Huahai under our various agreements, $10.0 million of which were pursuant to the joint participation agreement and an aggregate of $5.0 million from GMS Tenshi under our joint development and licensing agreement. 
 Competition 
 Biosimilars have become a significant growth area for the biopharmaceutical industry, attracting large pharmaceutical companies as well as small niche players. Biosimilars of complex mAbs have limited competition to those industry players who have a high technical capability. The large players who have successfully taken mAb products into Phase 3 clinical trials include Amgen Inc., or Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, or Boehringer, Hanwha Chemical Corporation, Pfizer, Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (a Merck/Biogen/ Samsung biosimilar venture), or Bioespis, Sandoz International GmbH, or Sandoz and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd, while smaller niche players with clinical assets include us, Adello Biologics, LLC, Celltrion, Inc., or Celltrion, Coherus Biosciences, Inc., or Coherus and Mylan N.V., or Mylan, as well as other regional developers. 
 Additionally, companies developing novel products with similar indications, and the innovator companies that are implementing protection strategies are expected to influence our ability to penetrate and maintain market share. Competition from generic small molecule manufacturers may also arise although these companies are less likely to have the technical, regulatory and clinical expertise required to succeed in this market unless they partner or acquire experienced biotech entities. 
 Our principal mAb biosimilar competitors include both companies with biologic reference products, such as AbbVie, Inc. (the holder of rights to Humira), Genentech Inc. (the holder of rights to the Avastin and Herceptin), as well as those with biosimilar products and/or reference products, such as Pfizer (pipeline, which includes at least five biosimilar candidates), Amgen (pipeline, which includes at least six biosimilar candidates with two FDA-approved biosimilar products), Sandoz (as a biosimilar company with two FDA-approved biosimilar products), and Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck with one FDA-approved biosimilar (through its joint venture collaboration aimed at developing and commercializing biosimilar candidates with Samsung Bioepsis). Companies principally engaged in biosimilar development include Samsung Bioepsis (pipeline, which initially includes six biosimilar candidates), Coherus (pipeline, which includes at least three biosimilar candidates), Mylan (pipeline, with seven biosimilar programs), and Celltrion (pipeline, with an FDA-approved biosimilar and at least five other biosimilar candidates). Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human 

 18

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  resources than we do and greater experience in the discovery and development of mAb product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for mAb biosimilars and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may commercialize that may cause limited market share before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid development of mAb biosimilar candidates than us. 
 These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, the ability to work with specific clinical contract organizations due to conflict of interest, and the conduct of trials in the ability to recruit clinical trial sites and subjects for our clinical trials. 
 We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Further, we are planning to begin providing contract development and manufacturing services to development stage biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies on a fee for service basis. There are currently a number of large, well-established competitors in this market, including; Albany Molecular Research Inc., Cambrex Corporation, Catalent, Inc, Consort Medical plc, DPx Holdings B.V., Lonza Group AG-REG, Recipharm AB, and Siegfried AG. While we believe that the companies we intend to target are underserved by these contract manufacturing companies, our competitors have been providing these services for an extended period of time and have long term relationships with many of the companies we may target as clients.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our technologies where applicable and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by, among other methods, evaluating relevant patents, establishing defensive positions, monitoring EU oppositions and pending intellectual property rights, preparing litigation strategies in view of the U.S.legislative framework and filing U.S. and international patent applications on technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. As of September 30, 2017, we own six pending international applications that were filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, which relate to formulations developed for ONS-3010 and ONS-1045, methods of antibody purification, methods for purifying antibodies to separate isoforms, reducing high molecular weight species, and modulating afucosylated species as well as efficiently determine the amino acid sequence of antibodies. If granted, patents issuing from these six pending PCT applications are expected to expire in 2036 or 2037, absent any adjustment or extensions. In addition, we own two provisional patent applications related to new formulations for ONS-3010 at higher concentrations. Any patents that may eventually issue claiming priority to these two provisional patent applications are expected to expire in 2038. The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. Thus, a single PCT application can be converted into a patent application in any of the more than 145 PCT contracting states, and is considered a simple, cost-effective means for seeking patent protection in numerous regions or countries. This nationalization (converting into an application in any of the contracting states) typically occurs 18 months after the PCT application filing date. Our first PCT application was nationalized in April 2016 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these nine applications 

 19

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  are expected to expire in 2034, absent any adjustments or extensions. Our second PCT application was nationalized in July 2017 in Europe and the United States. If granted, patents issuing from these two applications are expected to expire in 2036, absent any adjustments or extensions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. 
 Regulatory 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities at the federal, state and local level in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of biopharmaceutical products such as our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 FDA Approval Process for Biosimilars 
 All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA as biologics. The FDA subjects biologics to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act, or PHSA as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, govern the regulatory pathway for biosimilar products. In addition, other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of biologics. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending biologics license application, or BLA, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, untitled and warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal penalties. 
 Under the BPCIA, a biologic may be demonstrated to be “biosimilar” if data show that the product is “highly similar” to a reference product. This is demonstrated through extensive analytical studies, animal studies (if deemed necessary), and clinical trials in a sensitive patient population to confirm that “residual uncertainties” do not have clinically meaningful impact. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Similar to innovator products, FDA requires submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, prior to testing biosimilar investigational products in humans. The IND is composed of the clinical protocol and other documentation such as non-clinical and CMC data to assure the safe conduct of the study. The sponsor submits an IND to FDA to place the IND into effect. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of the IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing. If during the 30-day waiting period the FDA does not raise concerns or questions related to the safety of the proposed clinical trials or other data submitted by imposing a clinical hold, the clinical trial may begin. 
 Prior to IND submission of a biosimilar candidate, if previous human data are not available or if the analytical data warrant, in vivo preclinical tests may be required to assess the safety of the product. Other preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and in vitro functional testing. This preclinical work is highly dependent on the development of robust analytical tests. An IND must become effective before United States clinical trials may begin.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Clinical trials for biosimilars involve the administration of the new investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if, among other things, it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unreasonable and significant risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Clinical trials for biosimilar development are typically conducted in two sequential phases. In Phase 1, the investigational product is initially compared to the reference product by dosing healthy human subjects or patients to assess PK, pharmacological actions, and safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, initial human testing may be conducted in the intended patient population. A Phase 3 clinical trial is then undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to demonstrate that any residual uncertainty about biosimilarity which may exist after conducting prior trials does not have clinical impact in light of the totality of the evidence for the product candidate. Well-designed and well-conducted trials conducted outside of the United States in accordance with GCP are also acceptable to the FDA in support of product licensing if the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. Other clinical study designs may be acceptable to regulators if justified. 
 After successful completion of the required clinical testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information regarding the investigational product is prepared and submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more of the reference product’s indications. FDA review and approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a detailed compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology and CMC and must demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product based on these results. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the Biosimilar User Fee Act, as reauthorized in 2017, or BsUFA II, the sponsor must submit initial and annual biological product development fees, an application fee at the time of submission of the BLA program fees for approved biosimilars. These fees are typically increased annually and will total several million dollars over the product’s market life. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of biosimilar BLAs. The FDA’s stated goal for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 is to review 90% of original biosimilar biologic applications within ten months of the 60 day filing date. Although the FDA can meet its user fee performance goals, the review process may be extended by requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a biosimilar BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product candidate has no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product, and the manufacturing process and facility meet standards designed to assure the product candidate’s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the 

 21

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  facility or the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it verifies compliance with cGMP and the BLA contains adequate data that provide substantial evidence that the product candidate meets the requirement of “highly similar” to the reference product. 
 After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Under BsUFA II, the FDA has committed to reviewing 90% of resubmissions of biosimilar BLAs within six months of receipt. FDA approval is never guaranteed, and the FDA will not approve a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. 
 The approval of our product candidates may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the dosage forms (if multiple forms are filed) or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to minimize any risk associated with the product. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy may be required as a condition of approval. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biologics as Biosimilar or Interchangeable under 351(k) 
 The BPCIA amended the PHSA by adding section 351(k) that created an abbreviated approval pathway for biologics shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biologic. Under the BPCIA, a biologic may be demonstrated to be “biosimilar” if data show that, among other things, the product is “highly similar” to a reference product. This is demonstrated through extensive analytical studies, animal studies (when deemed necessary), and clinical trials in a sensitive patient population to confirm that “residual uncertainties” do not have clinically meaningful impact. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. In addition, an application submitted under the 351(k) pathway must include information demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product and reference product have the same route of administration, dosage form and the strength and the biosimilar product utilizes the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use approved in the proposed labeling to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product. 
 Biosimilarity under the BPCIA means that the biologic is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biologic and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. Therefore, in addition to a complete CMC data submission as required for a 351(a) BLA, an application submitted under section 351(k) is required to include data supporting the analytical similarity of the proposed biosimilar product to the reference product. 
 If a manufacturer intends to use data from an animal study or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k), the sponsor must provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. The type of bridging data that is required includes data from analytical studies that directly compare all three products, i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK and/or PD study data for all three products. FDA makes a final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge during the review of the application.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Moreover, the BPCIA provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the reference product. After the assessment of biosimilarity, the higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. FDA’s implementation of the 351(k) approval pathway is still evolving, and the acceptance for filing and review of a 351(k) application is subject to the same refusals to file or approve that are described above for 351(a) BLAs. In addition, the FDA may accept a 351(k) application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical trials to demonstrate such biosimilarity under section 351(k) or submit a BLA for licensure as a new biologic under section 351(a). 
 The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the reference product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving, or accepting applications for, any product candidates that are purportedly biosimilar to the reference product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for 12 years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application under the 351(k) pathway for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States and is publicly available in the FDA’s Purple Book. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a subsequent application for a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated as an orphan drug may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the 12-year biologic reference product exclusivity period or the end of the seven year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent and thus block §351(k) applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension. 
 The first biosimilar product determined to be interchangeable with a reference product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (i) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (ii) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first approved interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (iii) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit instituted against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (iv) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued for patent infringement.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements 
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing post-approval regulatory requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, testing requirements, manufacturing, distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. For instance, the FDA closely regulates post-approval marketing and promotion concerning communications for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of untitled and warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
 Biologics, like other pharmaceutical products, may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved conditions specified in the BLA. After approval, changes to the information submitted in the BLA may require submission to the FDA. Generally, there are three types of filing mechanisms to the approved application: prior approval supplement, changes being effected supplement and annual report. The filing type is dictated by the assessment of the potential to impact quality, efficacy and/or safety and each holds specific review and/or approval timelines. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety reports are required following FDA approval of a BLA. As a condition of the BLA approval, the FDA also may require additional information that may include additional analytical or clinical studies and a REMS or other conditions to assess and/or monitor the quality and safety of the approved product. 
 All manufacturing operations, including manufacturing, testing, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to meet cGMP requirements after approval. Product manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must have dedicated resources in the areas of production, quality control, and quality assurance to maintain compliance with cGMP. 
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in the withdrawal of the product approval, product recall or marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals. A change in the safety profile may result in revisions to the approved labeling to update safety information; post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or distribution restrictions or other requirements under a REMS program. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, either to induce or award the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, recommending or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on, in certain cases, sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the 

 24

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 Additionally, the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government has used the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other illegal sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements regarding the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, for covered entities, or certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA. 
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, via the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Such manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. 
 Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Additionally, analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. State laws may also apply that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance 

 25

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  promulgated by the federal government, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The Affordable Care Act has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. We continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act has on our business. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers. In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. The Affordable Care Act, as well as other federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenues. 
International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, foreign regulations also govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates within their jurisdiction. The regulatory approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, the approval of a biosimilar for marketing is based on an opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency and a decision issued by the European Commission. However, substitution of a biosimilar for the innovator is a decision that is made at the local (national) level on a country-by-country basis. Additionally, a number of European countries do not permit the automatic substitution of biosimilars for the reference product. Many countries also have published their own legislation outlining a regulatory pathway for the development and approval of biosimilars. In some cases, countries have either adopted European guidance or are following guidance issued by the World Health Organization. Although similarities are apparent across these various regulatory guidances, there is also the potential for additional country-specific requirements. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party 

 26

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our product candidates, once approved, may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement compared to existing approved biologics and other therapies. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs in the United States, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
