Item 1. Business
This annual report on Form 10-K is a combined report being filed by two separate Registrants, American States Water Company (“AWR”) and Golden State Water Company (“GSWC”). References in this report to “Registrant” are to AWR and GSWC, collectively, unless otherwise specified. GSWC makes no representations as to the information contained in this report relating to AWR and its subsidiaries, other than GSWC.
AWR makes its periodic reports, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and current reports, Form 8-K, available free of charge through its website, www.aswater.com, as soon as material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such reports are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. AWR also makes available free of charge its code of business conduct and ethics, its corporate governance guidelines and the charters of its Nominating and Governance Committee, Compensation Committee and Audit and Finance Committee through its website or by calling (877) 463-6297. AWR and GSWC have filed the certification of officers required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Overview
AWR is the parent company of GSWC, Bear Valley Electric Service, Inc. ("BVESI") and American States Utility Services, Inc. (“ASUS”) (and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Fort Bliss Water Services Company (“FBWS”), Terrapin Utility Services, Inc. (“TUS”), Old Dominion Utility Services, Inc. (“ODUS”), Palmetto State Utility Services, Inc. (“PSUS”), Old North Utility Services, Inc. (“ONUS”), Emerald Coast Utility Services, Inc. (“ECUS”) and Fort Riley Utility Services, Inc. (“FRUS”)). On July 1, 2020, GSWC completed the transfer of the electric utility assets and liabilities from its electric division to BVESI, in exchange for common shares of BVESI. GSWC then immediately distributed all of BVESI's common shares to AWR, whereupon BVESI became wholly owned directly by AWR. This reorganization did not result in any substantive changes to AWR's operations and business segments.
AWR has three reportable segments: water, electric and contracted services. Within the segments, AWR has three principal business units, water and electric service utility operations conducted through its regulated utilities GSWC and BVESI, respectively, and contracted services conducted through ASUS and its subsidiaries. FBWS, TUS, ODUS, PSUS, ONUS, ECUS and FRUS may be referred to herein collectively as the “Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.”
GSWC is a public water utility engaged in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water in 10 counties in the State of California.  GSWC is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”).  BVESI is a public electric utility that distributes electricity in several San Bernardino County mountain communities in California, and is also regulated by the CPUC. Additional information regarding public utility regulation is discussed in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition" and Results of Operation" under the section titled "Regulatory Matters." 
AWR's regulated utilities served 261,796 water customers and 24,545 electric customers at December 31, 2020, or a total of 286,341 customers, compared with 260,708 water customers and 24,420 electric customers at December 31, 2019, or a total of 285,128 customers. Both GSWC’s and BVESI's operations exhibit seasonal trends. Although both have diversified customer bases, residential and commercial customers account for the majority of water and electric sales and revenues. Revenues derived from commercial and residential customers accounted for approximately 90% of total water and electric revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
ASUS, itself or through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, has contracted with the U.S. government to provide water and/or wastewater services at various military installations. ASUS operates, maintains and performs construction activities (including renewal and replacement capital work) on water and/or wastewater systems at various U.S. military bases pursuant to 50-year firm, fixed-price contracts.  Each of the contracts with the U.S. government is subject to termination, in whole or in part, prior to the end of its 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the ASUS subsidiary performing the contract. The price for each of these contracts is subject to annual economic price adjustments. Contracts are also subject to modifications for changes in circumstances, changes in laws and regulations, and additions to the contract value for new construction of facilities at the military bases.  AWR guarantees performance of ASUS’s military privatization contracts.
Pursuant to the terms of these contracts, the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate the following water and wastewater systems:

Subsidiary | Military Base | Type of System | Location 
FBWS | Fort Bliss | Water and Wastewater | Texas and New Mexico
TUS | Joint Base Andrews | Water and Wastewater | Maryland 
ODUS | Fort Lee | Wastewater | Virginia 
ODUS | Joint-Base Langley Eustis and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story | Water and Wastewater | Virginia 
PSUS | Fort Jackson | Water and Wastewater | South Carolina 
ONUS | Fort Bragg, Pope Army Airfield and Camp Mackall | Water and Wastewater | North Carolina 
ECUS | Eglin Air Force Base | Water and Wastewater | Florida 
FRUS | Fort Riley | Water and Wastewater Collection and Treatment | Kansas 

Certain financial information for each of AWR’s business segments - water distribution, electric distribution, and contracted services - is set forth in Note 17 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of American States Water Company and its subsidiaries. While AWR’s water and electric utility segments are not dependent upon a single or only a few customers, the U.S. government is the primary customer for ASUS’s contracted services.  ASUS, from time to time, performs work at military bases for other prime contractors of the U.S. government. 
Seasonality
The demand for water and electricity varies by season. For instance, there can be a higher level of water consumption during the third quarter of each year when weather in California tends to be hot and dry. During unusually wet weather, our customers generally use less water. The CPUC has adopted regulatory mechanisms that help mitigate fluctuations in revenues due to changes in water consumption by our customers in California. 
The demand for electricity in our electric customer service area is greatly affected by winter snow levels. An increase in winter snow levels reduces the use of snowmaking machines at ski resorts in the Big Bear area and, as a result, reduces our electric revenues. Likewise, unseasonably warm weather during a skiing season may result in temperatures too high for snowmaking conditions, which also reduces our electric revenues. The CPUC has also adopted regulatory mechanisms for our electric business, which helps mitigate fluctuations in the revenues of our electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by BVESI’s customers.
Environmental Regulation
AWR’s subsidiaries are subject to extensive environmental regulations. GSWC is required to comply with safe drinking water requirements, including testing to determine constituents in its water supply and customer notification requirements if certain contaminants exceed maximum levels or advisory levels, and requirements to address issues relating to known contamination. The subsidiaries of ASUS are subject to similar requirements in connection with their water and wastewater operations on military bases. GSWC is also responsible for clean-up and remediation at a plant site that contained an underground storage tank. As mandated by legislation enacted in California, BVESI is required to submit wildfire mitigation plans to the CPUC for approval. California requires all electric utilities to prepare plans on constructing, maintaining, and operating their electrical lines and equipment to minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire. 
The regulated utilities spent approximately $20.6 million in 2020 and expects to spend approximately $22.9 million in 2021 for capital expenditures on environmental control facilities. In addition, various other capital expenditures are incurred for purposes other than environmental control facilities, but may also have some environmental benefits. An environmental control facility is any facility that is reasonably expected to abate, reduce or aid in the prevention, measurement, control of monitoring of noise, air or water pollutants, solid waste, thermal pollution, radiation or other pollutants.
Environmental matters and compliance with such laws and regulations are discussed further in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled “Environmental Matters.”
Climate Change
Climate change impacts both GSWC’s water supply and the need to consider investing in additional infrastructure, such as desalination projects, reclaimed water projects, groundwater storage projects or additional pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply. Climate change has also resulted in reductions in customer usage as a result of installation of water-saving devices by customers, changes in landscaping to more drought resistant plants, and reduced water usage by customers to comply with drought restrictions. In addition, GSWC faces competition primarily from governmental entities who are able to supply, through GSWC, reclaimed or recycled water to GSWC customers, in lieu of GSWC supplying potable water to these customers. Additional information on GSWC’s water supplies is discussed further in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled “Water Supplies.”
Climate change has also impacted electric utilities in California due to an increase in wildfires. As a result of legislation adopted in 2018, BVESI is required to submit wildfire mitigation plans to the CPUC. Compliance with the plans will result in an increase in capital expenditures for wildfire mitigation projects. BVESI will not be able to recover the costs incurred to make capital improvements included in BVESI’s current wildfire mitigation plans from ratepayers until the CPUC approves recovery of these costs in its next general rate case filing, which will set new rates beginning in 2023. Power supplies may also become more constrained and more expensive due to regulation of power plants using fossil fuels.
Both GSWC and BVESI must comply with regulations relating to the emission of greenhouse gases. BVESI must also comply with California’s renewable energy requirements. 
Additional information regarding compliance with laws and regulations addressing climate change issues is provided in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled “Climate Change.”
COVID-19
GSWC, BVESI, and ASUS have continued their operations given that their water, wastewater, and electric utility services are deemed essential. The response of GSWC and BVESI to COVID-19 has included: (i) suspending service disconnections for nonpayment pursuant to CPUC orders; (ii) increasing the allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the higher levels of customer balances past due, (iii) establishing memorandum accounts to track incremental expenses related to COVID-19, including bad debt expense, in order to file for future recovery of these expenses, (iv) increasing the number of employees telecommuting; and (v) delaying some capital improvement projects at the water segment. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant volatility in financial markets, which could continue. The continued economic impact could adversely impact the value of GSWC’s pension and retirement plan assets due to possible declines in security prices.
Additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on GSWC and BVESI is provided in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled “COVID-19.”
Competition
The businesses of GSWC and BVESI are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories.  However, GSWC and BVESI may be subject to eminent domain proceedings in which governmental agencies, under state law, may acquire GSWC’s water systems or BVESI's electric system if doing so is necessary and in the public’s interest. GSWC competes with governmental agencies and other investor-owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms, availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis. ASUS actively competes for business with other investor-owned utilities, other third-party providers of water and/or wastewater services, and governmental entities primarily on the basis of quality of service and price.
AWR Workforce
AWR and its subsidiaries had a total of 841 employees as of December 31, 2020.  GSWC had 525 employees as of December 31, 2020. BVESI had 43 employees, sixteen of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which expires in December 2025. All of the employees of GSWC and BVESI are located in California. ASUS and its subsidiaries had a total of 273 employees as of December 31, 2020. Thirteen of FBWS's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers. This agreement expires in September 2022.
Our business requires a combination of complex infrastructure, regulation and customer service. Ongoing development of our talent across the organization to meet critical business needs is a continual focus, and includes (i) building a culture such that high-potential talent is identified and further developed, (ii) creating career paths that not only move up a 
specialized ladder, but across the organization, and (iii) offering opportunities for employees to accept new challenges through stretch assignments.
Attracting Diverse Candidates 
We understand that strength comes from having a diverse employee population. We strive to hire from our local communities and have a workforce that is representative, at all job levels, of the communities we serve. This begins with the recruitment process. We strive to have all aspects of employment, including the decision to hire, promote, discipline, or discharge, be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. It is our policy not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law.
Safety and Training
Strong Occupational Health and Safety practices reduce injuries, keep our workforce healthy, and reduce operating costs. A safe workforce translates into better performance company-wide. We work to create a safety-focused culture in which each individual feels personally responsible for their own safety, the safety of their co-workers, as well as the safety of the communities they serve. Safety performance is included as a metric in the officer and manager compensation programs. Employees attend training in various mandated safety programs that are applicable to their operations. In addition, there are regulatory safety training requirements as well as training requirements for the Department of Transportation and training requirements for compliance with local, state, and federal environmental laws.
To reinforce our safety efforts and protocols, company-wide safety inspections at GSWC and BVESI are conducted with supervisors. The inspection reports are forwarded to management for review, allocation of resources are made (if needed), and corrective actions are taken. ASUS has a dedicated Safety Coordinator located at each military base installation served. The onsite Safety Coordinator provides regulatory compliance, as well as beneficial health and safety monitoring functions. 
Learning and Development
Compliance training is required each year, for each employee. Other types of training are offered on an optional basis. Examples of optional programs include ongoing water operations competencies and education, supervisor development, knowledge capture and management, feedback and measurements to show the value of learning solutions, and administrative oversight for various business competencies relative to mandated training and compliance requirements. We pay for approved external business-related seminars and workshops. Certain positions require employees to maintain all of their job-specific certifications, licenses and continuing education credits.
On a regular and ongoing basis, we require all employees to certify that they have reviewed and understand our Code of Conduct as well as our Employee Handbook. We provide harassment and prevention awareness training for all employees.
Succession Planning 
On an annual basis, our senior management team completes a roadmap for improving human capital management by developing succession plans with the goal of achieving the most efficient alignment of resources and talent to meet business needs. This includes identifying key succession positions and potential successors for top-level positions, such as Vice Presidents, for the next ten years.
Recruiting, developing and retaining the right talent is key to our long-term success. With 28% of our employees eligible for retirement in the next five years, we are focused on transferring institutional knowledge, continue succession planning and pursue recruitment and development strategies to attract qualified talent.
