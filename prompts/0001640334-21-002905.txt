ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview

Body and Mind is a multi-state cannabis operator, which has retail, distribution, cultivation, and/or processing operations in Nevada, California, Arkansas and Ohio. 

Our platform approach to expansion focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions, entering new markets through lower cost license applications and opportunistic/targeted acquisitions.

We have developed the marquis lifestyle “Body and Mind” brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries and have recently expanded our brand and products to dispensaries in California. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including flower, oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles.

We have a long track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with licensing to manufacture for brands. We completed construction and commenced production operations at the new Nevada production facility in August of 2020.

We are a Nevada corporation that, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nevada Medical Group, LLC (“NMG”), are engaged in the cultivation and production of medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products. NMG produces cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles under license in the state of Nevada, which are available for sale under the brand name “Body and Mind” in dispensaries in Nevada. 

In California, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary NMG Cathedral City, LLC (“NMGCC”), were managing a licensed cannabis business conducting commercial cannabis activity in Cathedral City, California pursuant to a management agreement with Satellites Dip, LLC (“SD”) who is the actual licensed manufacturer. On November 30, 2019, we along with NMGCC entered into a settlement agreement with SD with respect to the management agreement and NMGCC entered into a brand director agreement with SD whereby NMGCC provides certain advisory and brand director services in connection with SD’s manufacture of Company-branded products, as well as certain other products as agreed to by NMGCC. In addition, as part of the revised arrangement with SD, our wholly-owned subsidiary, DEP Nevada Inc. (“DEP”) entered into a brand license agreement with SD whereby DEP has granted SD a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sub-licensable right to use certain licensed marks in connection with or on licensed products. On April 30, 2021, we terminated all agreements with SD.

In April 2020, we closed the San Diego ShowGrow dispensary transaction, which is owned 60% by our wholly-owned subsidiary, NMG San Diego, LLC (“NMG SD”), and has received all licenses, permits and authorizations required to conduct medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail operations. The San Diego ShowGrow dispensary opened in early July 2020. We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NMG Long Beach, LLC (“NMG LB”), have been managing the ShowGrow Long Beach dispensary operations for over a year, received all approvals and final license transfer for the dispensary, which was transferred to NMG LB at the end of August 2020 and is expected to close in the near future. 

On July 11, 2021, we announced receipt of local approval for a cannabis manufacturing facility in Cathedral City, California and execution of a lease for the facility. We have applications in process with the California Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) for a type “N” manufacturing license, and with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) for a distribution license, which is anticipated to allow us to manufacture and distribute our BaM branded flower products, extracts, oils and edibles.

In Ohio, we, through NMG, were managing the fully operational The Clubhouse dispensary located in Elyria, Ohio, which is owned by NMG Ohio LLC, of which we own 30% through our subsidiary NMG, and have an agreement to acquire the remaining 70% of NMG Ohio LLC. We received all approvals and final license and name transfer from the Ohio Department of Pharmacy in early September 2020 and transferred the dispensary license and all assets and liabilities associated with such dispensary from NMG Ohio LLC to a 100% owned subsidiary of Body and Mind; however, the transfer of the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio LLC to NMG will not occur until NMG Ohio LLC receives a production license. On September 17, 2021, the final award of the production license was transferred to our wholly owned subsidiary, NMG OH P1 LLC, and the transaction closed resulting in NMG now owning 100% of NMG Ohio.

In Arkansas, we, through NMG, manage the “Body and Mind” branded medical marijuana dispensary in West Memphis, Arkansas, which opened on April 27, 2020.

Our common stock is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol “BAMM” and our common stock is posted for trading on the OTCQB Venture Market under the symbol “BMMJ.” 

Our head office located at 750 – 1095 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 2M6.

Business Operations

Development of Our Business

Incorporation and Early Corporate History

We were incorporated on November 5, 1998 in the State of Delaware under the name Concept Development Group, Inc. In May 2004, we acquired 100% of Kaleidoscope Venture Capital, Inc. (formerly Vocalscape Networks, Inc.) and changed our name to Vocalscape, Inc. In November 2005, we changed our name to Nevstar Precious Metals Inc. In September 2008, we changed our name to Deploy Technologies Inc. (“Deploy Tech”) and effective November 14, 2017, we changed our name to Body and Mind, Inc. (“Body and Mind”).

On September 15, 2010, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Deploy Acquisition Corp. (“Deploy”) under the laws of the State of Nevada, USA. On September 17, 2010, Deploy completed a merger with Deploy Tech, its former parent company, pursuant to which Deploy was the surviving corporation and assumed all the assets, obligations and commitments of Deploy Tech. Upon the completion of the merger Deploy assumed the name “Deploy Technologies Inc.” and all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Deploy Tech was automatically converted into and became Deploy’s – that is, our Company’s issued and outstanding common stock. 

On May 10, 2011, we registered as an extra-provincial company in British Columbia, and on September 30, 2011, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate 2,900,000 shares of our authorized capital stock as Class A Preferred Shares (the “Preferred Shares”). On September 2, 2014, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the authorized Preferred Shares from 2,900,000 shares to 20,000,000 shares. 

On November 11, 2014, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our authorized as well as the issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “Common Shares”) on the basis of one (1) new share for ten (10) old shares. This resulted in a reduction of our authorized capital from 100,000,000 Common Shares to 10,000,000 Common Shares, and a reduction of our issued and outstanding Common Shares from 23,130,209 Common Shares to approximately 2,313,021 Common Shares. On April 11, 2017, we filed a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to increase the authorized capital from 10,000,000 Common Shares to 900,000,000 Common Shares.

Acquisition of Nevada Medical Group, LLC

On September 14, 2017, we, with DEP, entered into a definitive agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Nevada Medical Group, LLC (“NMG”), whereby DEP acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of NMG in exchange for (a) 16,000,000 post reverse-split Common Shares, (b) $2,000,000 cash, and (b) promissory notes (the “Promissory Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000, to the NMG securityholders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective ownership interest in NMG. The Promissory Notes were secured by a senior priority security interest in all of our assets, and were due to be repaid at the earlier of fifteen (15) months from the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement, or, if an equity or debt financing subsequent to the Concurrent Financing (as defined below) were to be closed in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000, then within 30 days of the closing date of such subsequent financing. The Share Exchange Agreement closed on November 14, 2017.

Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we changed our name to “Body and Mind, Inc.”, effective on November 14, 2017, by filing a certificate of amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State; at the same time, we cancelled our entire authorized class of Preferred Shares. In addition, on November 14, 2017, we filed a certificate of change with the Nevada Secretary of State whereby we reverse split our issued and outstanding Common Shares on the basis of one (1) new share for three (3) old shares (the “Consolidation”) which resulted in there being 28,239,876 Common Shares issued and outstanding post-Consolidation. Subsequent to completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, we filed articles of exchange with the Nevada Secretary of State.

Concurrent with the Share Exchange Agreement, we completed an equity financing to raise aggregate gross proceeds of CAD$6,007,430 through the issuance of subscription receipts (the “Subscription Receipts”), at a pre-Consolidation price of CAD$0.22 per Subscription Receipt (the “Concurrent Financing”). On November 14, 2017, each Subscription Receipt was exchanged in accordance with its terms, for no additional consideration, for one pre-Consolidation Common Share and one common share purchase warrant (each a “Warrant”) of the Company. Each Warrant was exercisable by the holder at a price of CAD$0.90 for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance.

On completion of the Share Exchange Agreement, we assumed the business of NMG, being the cultivation and production of medical marijuana products.

Convertible Loan and Management Agreements with Comprehensive Care Group LLC

On March 19, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries DEP and NMG, entered into a convertible loan agreement (the “Convertible Loan Agreement”) and a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”), respectively, with Comprehensive Care Group LLC (“CCG”), an Arkansas limited liability company, with respect to the development of a medical marijuana dispensary including a 50 flowering plant cultivation facility in West Memphis, Arkansas which agreements were effective as of March 15, 2019.

Pursuant to the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP agreed to make loan advances to CCG from time to time in the aggregate principal amount of up to $1,250,000 and as of July 31, 2020, DEP has loaned $ 1,353,373 to CCG. The loan proceeds were used to fund the construction of the medical marijuana dispensary facility, and to provide working capital to cover initial operating expenses. The construction was completed and all permits and licenses were received for the dispensary in late April 2020, which opened for operations on April 27, 2020.

The interest on the outstanding principal amount is currently set at $6,000 per month, payable monthly in arrears on or before the first calendar day of each month. CCG is not obligated to repay any principal outstanding under the loan until March 30, 2021. Either CCG or DEP may unilaterally extend the maturity date by one year, and may thereafter continue to extend the maturity date on a yearly basis by increments of one year (each, an “Extension Option”) by providing written notice of the exercise of the Extension Option by the party seeking an extension to the other party; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall any extended maturity date extend beyond the expiration of the term of the Management Agreement entered into between NMG and CCG. The Company extended the loan maturity date by one year resulting in a new maturity date of March 30, 2022. The Management Agreement has an expiration of March 15, 2024 and can be mutually extendable.

Upon the latter of: (a) one year after granting of a medical marijuana dispensary license by the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission to CCG, or (b) one year after entering into the Convertible Loan Agreement, DEP may, in its sole discretion, subject to DEP providing all reasonable assistance to obtain all necessary approvals from the applicable government authorities to engage in the medical marijuana dispensary business, elect to convert all of the outstanding indebtedness into preferred units of CCG equal to 40% of the overall member units of CCG, subject to approval of the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission, with the following preferred rights: (i) the right to an allocative share of 66.67% of the net profits of CCG (as defined in the Convertible Loan Agreement) and the right to distributions equal to 66.67% of the net profits on a monthly basis; (ii) the right to a 66.67% share of CCG’s assets upon dissolution of CCG; and (iii) the right to 66.67% of all voting rights of members of CCG. DEP is waiting for regulatory clearance from the State regulators before proceeding with the conversion

Pursuant to the Management Agreement, NMG provides operations and management services to CCG (including management, staffing, operations administration, oversight and other related services) for the medical marijuana dispensary. In consideration for such services CCG pays NMG a monthly management fee in the amount equal to 66.67% of the Monthly Net Profits (as defined below) of CCG for the immediately-preceding month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that DEP exercises its conversion right under the Convertible Loan Agreement, then NMG’s monthly management fee shall be fixed at $6,000 per month, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. For purposes of the Management Agreement, “Monthly Net Profits” means, for each calendar month, an amount equal to CCG’s gross revenue for such calendar month less CCG’s operating expenses (including cost of goods sold, interest, and tax for said month), as reasonably determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Acquisition of NMG Ohio LLC

We, through NMG, currently own a 30% interest in NMG Ohio, LLC (“NMG Ohio”), which has a cannabis dispensary carrying on business as “The Clubhouse” in Elyria, Loraine County, Ohio. On January 31, 2019, we, through NMG, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio. The consideration for the remaining 70% interest in NMG Ohio consists of cash payments totaling $1,575,000 and 3,173,864 common shares of the Company. As at the date hereof, we have issued 3,173,864 common shares, with a fair value of $1,188,168, and paid $1,575,000. All share and cash payments for the transactions have been paid in full and closing of the acquisition was subject to receipt of regulatory approval, which all approvals and final license and name transfer approvals from the Ohio Department of Pharmacy were received in early September 2020 but the remaining 70% was not closed as of July 31, 2021. As such, the dispensary license for The Clubhouse dispensary, as well as the assets and liabilities associated with the dispensary, were transferred to the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NMG OH 1 LLC. On September 17, 2021, the final award of the production license was transferred to our wholly owned subsidiary, NMG OH P1 LLC, and the transaction closed resulting in NMG now owning 100% of NMG Ohio.

Strategic Investment and Commercial Advisory Agreements with Australis Capital Inc.

Pursuant to an investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) entered into with Australis Capital Inc. (“Australis”) on October 30, 2018, whereby Australis acquired (a) 16,000,000 units of the Company, with each unit being comprised of one share of our common stock and one common share purchase warrant at a purchase price of CAD$0.40 per unit, for gross proceeds of CAD$6,400,000 and (b) CAD$1,600,000 principal amount 8% unsecured convertible debentures (the “Debentures”) of the Company, we entered into a commercial advisory agreement (the “Commercial Advisory Agreement”) with Australis Capital (Nevada) Inc. (“Australis Nevada”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Australis, pursuant to which Australis Nevada has agreed to provide advisory and consulting services to us for a fee of $10,000 per month payable on the first day of each month for a term ending on the date that is the earlier of (i) five years following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Investment Agreement, and (ii) the date Australis no longer holds 10% or more of our Company’s issued and outstanding common shares. The foregoing is more fully disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 5, 2018. On July 1, 2019, we entered into a conversion agreement with Australis, whereby Australis has agreed to convert the Debentures on July 1, 2020. Upon execution of the conversion agreement, we remitted CAD$148,340 to Australis as an advanced interest payment for the period from November 2, 2018 to July 1, 2020. On July 1, 2020, we issued 2,909,091 Common Shares to Australis at a deemed value of CAD$0.55 per Common Shares and the Debentures were fully converted to Common Shares. 

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement and subject to certain exceptions, Australis will be entitled to maintain its pro rata ownership interest of the Company until such time as it no longer holds 10% or more of our issued and outstanding common shares.

Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Agreement and subject to applicable laws and the rules of the CSE, for as long as Australis owns at least 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Australis will be entitled to nominate one director for election to our Board of Directors of the Company. If Australis exercises all of its warrants and converts all of its debentures, Australis will be entitled to nominate a second director for election to our Board of Directors. Further, for as long as Australis maintains ownership of at least 25% of our issued and outstanding common shares, Australis will be entitled to maintain two directors on our Board of Directors, provided that each director nominee must meet the requirements of applicable corporate, securities and other laws and rules of the CSE. As of July 31, 2020, Australis has exercised all of its warrants and the Debentures have all been converted, however, Australis no longer maintains ownership of at least 25% of our outstanding Common Shares. Australis’ current nominee director on our Board of Directors is Brent Reuter.

On September 2, 2021, Australis ownership of Body and Mind fell below 10% which resulted in the termination of the parties obligations under the Investment Agreement and Commercial Advisory Agreement.

Transaction and Settlement with Green Light District Holdings Inc. – ShowGrow Long Beach and San Diego

Prior Agreement with Green Light District Holdings Inc.

On November 28, 2018, we entered into an interim agreement (the “Prior GLDH Agreement”) with Green Light District Holdings Inc. (“GLDH”), a private company incorporated under the laws of Delaware, and David Barakett, whereby our Company agreed to acquire up to 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of GLDH. We concurrently made a strategic investment in a senior secured convertible note issued by GLDH in the principal amount of $5,200,000 (the “Prior GLDH Note”), bearing interest at the rate of 20% per annum and maturing on November 28, 2020.

At the time, GLDH was the owner of the ShowGrow dispensary brand, and owner of: 


(a) | the ShowGrow Long Beach dispensary, 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | 43% of the equity interest and 60% of the voting rights in the ShowGrow San Diego dispensary, and
(c) | 30% of the equity interest in the ShowGrow Las Vegas dispensary. 


GLDH is also the owner of the ShowGrow app. The dispensaries were in various stages of licensing. 

In order to fund our original investment in GLDH, Australis advanced a $4,000,000 loan which was evidenced by a senior secured note dated November 28, 2018, bearing an interest rate of 15% per annum and maturing in two years. The terms required semi-annual interest payments unless we elected to accrue the interest by adding it to the principal amount of the debt facility. We may prepay the loan at any time, in any amount, subject to a 5% prepayment penalty on any amount repaid within the first year of the loan. Additionally, Australis exercised $1.2 million in warrants they held in our Company at an exercise price of CAD$0.50, which equated to 3,206,160 common shares. 

We paid a financing fee to Australis in the approximate amount of CAD$795,660, by issuing 1,105,083 Common Shares at a deemed price of CAD$0.72 per share.

Original Settlement and Release Agreement

On June 19, 2019, our Company, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary NMG LB, and our 60% owned subsidiary NMG SD, entered into a settlement agreement (the “Original GLDH Settlement Agreement”) with GLDH, The Airport Collective, Inc. (“Airport Collective”), Mr. Barakett, and SGSD, LLC (“SGSD”). SGSD was the commercial tenant at 7625 Carroll Road, San Diego, California 92121 (the “San Diego Location”). 

Pursuant to the Original GLDH Settlement Agreement, we, GLDH, and Mr. Barakett agreed to restructure the Prior GLDH Agreement, and enter into a mutual release of all claims related to the Prior GLDH Agreement. 

In connection with the settlement, (a) SGSD agreed to assign its lease for the San Diego Location to NMG SD, and (b) GLDH, Airport Collective and NMG LB entered into an asset purchase agreement dated June 19, 2019 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which NMG LB agreed to purchase all of the assets of GLDH and Airport Collective utilized in the medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail business at 3411 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach, CA 90804 (the “Long Beach Location”).

On June 28, 2019, we, NMG LB, NMG SD, GLDH, Airport Collective, Mr. Barakett, and SGSD entered into an amended and restated settlement and release agreement (the “Amended GLDH Settlement Agreement”) which supersedes and replaces the Original GLDH Settlement Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended GLDH Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed as follows:

9

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NMG SD is owned 60% by the our subsidiary, DEP, and 40% by SJJR, LLC (“SJJR”). Mr. Barakett agreed to cover SJJR’s portion of all start-up costs associated with NMG SD establishing commercial cannabis operations at the San Diego Location, inclusive of: (i) the costs associated with becoming a tenant at the San Diego Location; and (ii) all construction costs associated with building out the San Diego Location for NMG SD’s operations. The share consideration payable to Mr. Barakett under the Amended GLDH Settlement Agreement is subject to reduction if Mr. Barakett fails to meet this obligation on a timely basis.

NMG SD, which has assumed the lease on the ShowGrow San Diego premises, has been awarded its own medical commercial cannabis retail license and adult-use commercial retail license and commenced operations on April 15, 2020. In consideration for the landlord, Green Road, LLC, agreeing to consent to the assignment of the original lease with SGSD to NGM SD, we agreed to provide the following consideration to the landlord:


i. | $700,000 in Common Shares of the Company calculated upon execution of the assignment and first amendment to commercial lease (the “Assignment and First Amendment”), dated June 13, 2019, at the maximum discount allowed by the CSE to be issued to the landlord immediately following execution of the Assignment and First Amendment (1,031,725 shares issued on August 12, 2019);
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | $783,765 in cash to be paid to the landlord via bank draft within five (5) business days of execution of the Assignment and First Amendment (paid); and 
iii. | $750,000 in cash, plus interest at the rate of five percent (5%) simple per annum accruing from the effective date to be paid no later than five (5) business days of the landlord’s receipt from the City of San Diego of a Conditional Use Permit allowing adult-use commercial cannabis storefront retail operations at the San Diego Location (paid). 


Pursuant to the Assignment and First Amendment, the parties agreed to amend the original lease to permit NMG SD to have three (3) five (5) year renewal options as opposed to two (2) renewal options. In addition, the parties agreed to reduce the amount of the sale bonus provision in the original lease to $1,000,000 from $2,000,000, which shall only be payable in connection with the first two assignments triggering this obligation, and thereafter, assignments will not require payment of a sale bonus. Furthermore, the parties also amended certain provisions of the original lease to ensure that any change in members representing less than fifty percent (50%) of the existing membership interests of NMG SD shall be an excluded transaction and not trigger the sale bonus or be deemed an assignment requiring consent of the landlord.

Amended and Restated Convertible Note and General Security Agreement

As contemplated by the Original GLDH Settlement Agreement, we entered into a loan agreement with GLDH dated June 19, 2019 (the “2019 GLDH Loan Agreement”), pursuant to which the Prior GLDH Note has been superseded and replaced with an amended and restated senior secured convertible note payable to us by GLDH in the principal amount of $5,200,000 (the “Amended and Restated GLDH Note”). The Amended and Restated GLDH Note bears interest at the rate of 20% per annum, compounded annually, and will mature and become repayable on June 19, 2022. GLDH’s obligations under 2019 GLDH Loan Agreement and the Amended and Restated GLDH Note have been guaranteed by Airport Collective, and are secured under a security agreement dated June 19, 2019 by all of GLDH’s and Airport Collective’s personal property, including but not limited to equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, cash or cash equivalents, and rights under contracts.

Asset Purchase Agreement

Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, NMG Long Beach has agreed to purchase all of GLDH’s and Airport Collective’s assets (the “Purchased Assets”) utilized in the retail cannabis business at the Long Beach Location for $6,700,000. Upon closing of the transaction, the outstanding principal amount under the Amended and Restated GLDH Note will be applied to the purchase price, and Airport Collective will be released from its obligations as a guarantor of the GLDH’s obligations under the Amended and Restated GLDH Note. 

We will pay the balance of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets by issuing up to 2,681,006 Common shares at a deemed price of CAD$0.7439 per share (issued in escrow on August 12, 2019); the number of shares required to pay and satisfy the balance of the purchase price for the Purchased Assets in the amount of $1,500,000 was determined with reference to the Agreed Foreign Exchange Rate of CAD$1.3296:USD$1.00. NMG LB received all approvals and license transfer from local and state authorities to conduct medical and adult-use commercial cannabis retail operation at the Long Beach Location, which were transferred to NMG LB at the end of August 2020 and is expected to close in the near future. The purchase price is fixed and the share consideration remains subject to reduction with reference to the liabilities of the business that will be outstanding on the closing date, which is expected to occur in the near future. Any final settlement that is different than currently estimated will be allocated to other income or expense.

Contemporaneous Loan

We entered into a contemporaneous loan (the “Contemporaneous Loan”) with GLDH in the amount of $726,720 to fund certain business improvements and expansion needs of GLDH’s business operations. We and NMG LB agreed to forgive the Contemporaneous Loan on the date of closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Management Assignment and Assumption Agreement

On or around August 1, 2019, NMG LB began managing the ShowGrow Long Beach business pursuant to the management assignment and assumption agreement dated June 19, 2019, among NMG LB, GLDH and Airport Collective. Under the agreement, NMG LB is entitled to manage the business and recognize the profits from the business until NMG LB receives all approval and license transfer for operations at the Long Beach Location, which were received and transferred at the end of August 2020, and the Asset Purchase Agreement is expected to close in the near future.

On June 6, 2019, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NMGCC entered into a management and administrative services agreement (the “California Management Agreement”) with Satellites Dip, LLC, a California limited liability company (“SD”) that is licensed to carry on commercial cannabis distribution and manufacturing operations within the state of California. Under the California Management Agreement, NMGCC agreed to provide certain management and administrative services to SD, in exchange for a management fee equal to the greater of: (a) 30% of net profits (as such term is defined in the California Management Agreement); and (b) $10,000 per month. The California Management Agreement had an initial term expiring on June 6, 2020.

In addition, NMGCC agreed to broker commercial arrangements between SD and third-party cannabis brand owners, with the view to securing licenses for use in SD’s business. In particular, NMGCC agreed: (a) that, within 30 days of the effective date of the California Management Agreement, it would arrange for its affiliate company, NMG, to license certain trademarks and other intellectual property to SD for use relation to cannabis products to be manufactured by SD (the “Branded Products”) on terms at least as favorable as the most favored licensee; (b) to use good faith efforts to establish similar license agreements with third-party cannabis brand owners; and (c) to use good faith efforts to assist SD in the development of SD branded products in the event SD decides to create its own brand(s).


11


NMGCC furnished equipment and machinery necessary for the manufacture of the Branded Products by SD. As contemplated by the California Management Agreement, NMGCC has leased such equipment and machinery to SD pursuant to an Equipment Lease Agreement between the parties dated June 6, 2019. The initial term of the Equipment Lease Agreement will expire on June 6, 2020 (see below for the Settlement Agreement and First Amendment to the Equipment Lease Agreement). It is the intent of the parties that the monthly rent payable under the Equipment Lease Agreement be completely net to NMGCC, such that NMGCC will not be liable for any costs or expenses of any nature whatsoever relating to the equipment or any improvements to the equipment, or use of the equipment. SD is solely responsible for any such costs, charges, expenses, and outlays, including taxes, maintenance, and repairs.

In conjunction with entering into the California Management Agreement, we through NMGCC entered into a loan and security agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) dated June 6, 2019 (see below for the Settlement Agreement and Release Agreement), whereby NMGCC loaned SD US$250,000 to fund the property and business improvements and expansion needs of SD’s business operations. The loan was due and payable on June 6, 2020, subject to extension by mutual agreement between the parties, and bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum. Interest will accrue and be compounded quarterly, and will be payable by SD upon maturity. SD may prepay, in whole or in part, all or any portion of the principal amount and accrued interest on the loan without being subject to any pre-payment penalty. The loan was evidenced by a promissory note, and the performance of SD of its obligations under the loan agreement and the promissory note are secured pursuant to a security agreement.  See Settlement and Release Agreement below.

Settlement and Release Agreement

On November 30, 2019, we through NMGCC entered into a settlement and release agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with SD whereby NMGCC and SD agreed to terminate the California Management Agreement and to enter into a mutual release of any and all claims related to the California Management Agreement, subject to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. 

As of November 30, 2019, SD owed NMGCC management fees (the “Monies Owed”) under the California Management Agreement. In consideration of NMGCC’s discharge of the Monies Owed, SD has agreed to pay NMGCC one-hundred percent (100%) of all proceeds received from the sale of all or any part of its inventory (the “Inventory”) as of November 1, 2019. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, SD shall provide monthly updates of the remaining Inventory until the Inventory has been fully exhausted. NMGCC will determine the sale price for any item in Inventory subject to the Settlement Agreement. 

As part of the Settlement Agreement, each of SD and NMGCC mutually agree to release and discharge the other from any and all claims arising from the California Management Agreement on or before November 30, 2019.

Brand Director Agreement

In conjunction with the Settlement Agreement, on November 30, 2019, NMGCC entered into a brand director agreement (the “Brand Director Agreement”) with SD. Pursuant to the Brand Director Agreement, SD engaged NMGCC to provide certain advisory and brand director services in connection with SD’s manufacture of Company-branded products, as well as certain other products (the “Managed Products”) as agreed to by NMGCC (the “Brand Director Services”). The initial term of the Brand Director Agreement was six months and the parties may continue to renew the Brand Director Agreement for successive three-month renewal periods. 

The Brand Director Services include: (a) managing SD’s production of the Managed Products; (b) payment of a reimbursement fee to SD equal to the amount of direct costs and direct taxes applicable to the Managed Products; (c) managing inventory of the Managed Products; and (d) directing SD to enter into distribution agreements and sale agreements with third-party commercial cannabis licensees for the distribution and sale of the Managed Products in accordance with applicable law. Pursuant to the Brand Director Agreement, NMGCC will pay a monthly fee (the “Contribution Fee”) of $5,000 to SD, however, SD waived payment of the Contribution Fee for the first five (5) months of the Brand Direction Agreement.


12


In consideration for the Brand Director Services, SD agreed to pay NMGCC a monthly brand director fee to be calculated as follows: (x) net revenue for a single calendar month, multiplied by, (y) seventy-five percent (75%); (z) plus any fees to be paid to NMGCC in connection with the equipment lease agreement (the “Equipment Lease Agreement”) dated June 6, 2019 (the “Equipment Lease Fee”) added to the product of (x) and (y), the (q) total amount shall be the fee paid to NMGCC. If the net revenue, minus the product of (x) and (y) is less than the Equipment Lease Fee in any given month, the difference shall carry over to the subsequent month, to be added to that month’s Equipment Lease Fee, or the difference may be paid by SD at its sole option. The Brand Director Agreement was terminated on April 30, 2021.

Equipment Purchase Agreement

Also in conjunction with the Settlement Agreement, on November 30, 2019, NMGCC and SD entered into an equipment purchase agreement (the “Equipment Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which NMGCC agreed to purchase certain equipment (the “Equipment”) from SD. The aggregate purchase price for the Equipment is $235,685.

First Amendment to the Equipment Lease Agreement

On November 30, 2019, NMGCC and SD entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Equipment Lease Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, NMGCC and SD amended (i) the term of the Equipment Lease Agreement to be coterminous with the Brand Director Agreement; and (ii) to update the equipment being leased pursuant to the Equipment Lease Agreement and to update the monthly rental rate for the equipment being leased.
Release & Satisfaction of Loan Agreement

On November 30, 2019, NMGCC and SD entered into a release and satisfaction of loan agreement (the “Release Agreement”). Pursuant to the Release Agreement, NMGCC agreed that all indebtedness of SD to NMGCC arising from the Loan Agreement (and promissory note issued in connection with the Loan Agreement) was satisfied and discharged in full. The release was granted based on SD’s obligations and duties pursuant to the Equipment Purchase Agreement and its five (5) month waiver of the Contribution Fee under the Brand Director Agreement.
Nevada Production Facility

On June 20, 2019, we announced the receipt of a conditional use permit from Clark County, Nevada, for a new production facility located within one mile of NMG’s existing cultivation facility located at 3375 Pepper Lane, in Las Vegas. The facility is approximately 7,500 square feet, and tenant improvement of the building holding the facility was completed in February 2020. The facility includes high-volume extraction equipment, which we expect will dramatically increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency for our extraction products, including oils, wax, live resin and ambrosia. The facility also expands the kitchen area and creates an opportunity for the Company to white label for brands seeking an entry to the Nevada market. After passing all inspections, receiving all permits, and finalizing license transfer approvals, the new production facility began operations in March 2020.
Our Products and Services 

We cultivate and produce medical and adult-use recreational marijuana products such as cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles under the brand name “Body and Mind”. We also produce products under license agreements.

We have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis markets. The regulated medical and recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation. Accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctor’s recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. States have authorized numerous medical conditions as qualifying conditions for treatment with medical-use cannabis, including but not limited to treatment for cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, wasting syndrome, pain, nausea, seizures, muscle spasms, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraines, arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, lupus, residual limb pain, spinal cord injuries, inflammatory bowel disease and terminal illness. 


13


As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, 35 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws allowing their residents to use medical cannabis.

We believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation and production of products within the medical and recreational use cannabis industry:


· | Significant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis; 
· | Limited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses;
· | NMG is currently in the process of obtaining a recreational distribution license; 
· | NMG currently has three main product lines: (i) flower, (ii) edibles, and (iii) extracts; and 
· | NMG currently cultivates recreational marijuana. 


Notwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities.

We have a Nevada cannabis distribution license to distribute our products and our primary market is in the State of Nevada.

In addition to Body and Mind branded products, NMG manufactures products for national brands including Her Highness and GPen.

Our Strategy

Body and Mind’s strategy is focused on a platform approach to expansion which focuses on limited license states and jurisdictions. We work to maximize shareholder value through:

1) | Production and distribute Body and Mind branded products (production and/or cultivation); 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Use excess production capacity to produce and distribute synergistic third party brands; 
3) | Own or operate strategic retail stores for vertical integration; and 
4) | Enter new markets though lower cost applications and opportunistic / targeted acquisitions.


We have a track record of award-winning cannabis strains, flower and extracts and as early entrants to the Nevada market management has experience with writing license applications, cultivating and operating efficiently and working within a strict metric or track and trace environment. 

We have developed the premium, marquis lifestyle “Body and Mind” brand in Nevada with strong penetration into dispensaries. The Body and Mind brand appeals to a wide range of cannabis consumers with products including oils, extracts (wax, live resin, ambrosia) and edibles.

We have a long track record of producing award-winning cannabis products and we have success with licensing to manufacture for brands. We currently produce cannabis oil cartridges for Gpen, a well known vaporizer manufacturer. We currently produce cannabis products for Her Highness, a female focused cannabis brand. We have constructed and are operating in a new larger production facility and are in discussions with several cannabis brands who may be interested in having Body and Mind produce their brand and products under license in Nevada.

NMG was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 3, 2014. NMG was an early applicant in Nevada in 2014 and was awarded one of the first state medical licenses for both cultivation and production of marijuana. NMG has been a licensed producer and cultivator of cannabis products since it was issued its first cultivation license on November 5, 2015 and production license on December 10, 2015. On July 1, 2017, NMG was awarded an additional state recreational cultivation and production license. NMG produces cannabis flower, oil extracts and edibles, which are available for sale under the brand name “Body & Mind” in dispensaries in Nevada. 

NMG has several growth initiatives underway including new product introductions, product licensing, third party extraction, out-of-State licensing, and acquisitions.

Since our acquisition of NMG, as discussed in more detail above, we have been focused on:


(1) | improving NMG’s existing facility; 
----+-------------------------------------
(2) | increasing product availability; and
(3) | lowering production costs. 

Increased Product Availability

We focused on flower and developing top end strains during the early years of our business. When Nevada was a medical only market we performed significant research on edibles with products including granola bars, beef jerky, hard candies and gummies. We also performed significant research on extraction with products ranging from shatter, rosin, distillate and raw oil. 

As adult recreation rules changed the products that could be produced, we have focused on increasing our product offerings and licensing opportunities. We have determined that the edible market is a sector of the marijuana industry with a high profit margin. 

In addition, we have implemented improved recipes of our established edible products which has increased our product’s shelf life and improved taste. We have developed preparation recipes for our Pretzel Bites which is our top selling edible product and we have implemented an improved recipe for our gummies products. 

We continually work on research for new edible products and developing recipes. 

Lowering Our Production Costs 

As cannabis flower continues to be the foundation product for the marijuana industry, we are striving for continuous improvement to our cultivation process. Our aim will always focus on increasing the production yields of each harvest, and to obtain the highest quality product harvest. Doing so achieves two things for us and our customers: (1) allows us to maximize our profit; and (2) gives our customers the best value for their dollar by offering high quality THC products.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business 

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates all food and food ingredients introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce (with the exception of meat, poultry, and certain processed egg products). At this time, our edible food products are not introduced into or offered for sale in interstate commerce, and FDA approval of our edible products is not required. However, we must, and do, comply with food labeling requirements set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and the Nevada Department of Taxation, which include: a statement of identity, net quantity of contents, ingredient statement, manufacturer information, nutritional labeling, “use-by” date, safe handling instructions, an allergen statement, “Keep out of reach of children” statement, “THIS IS A CANNABIS PRODUCT” statement, cannabinoid profile, terpenoid profile, total amount of THC, our production license number, production run number, date of production, date of final testing, date on which the product was packaged, etc. 


15


Our operations as a licensed cultivator and producer of marijuana and marijuana products could be found in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act. Due to this, we may face higher federal income tax liability as it is subject to Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a cannabis company from deducting any expenses from their income on its federal income tax return, except for those considered to be cost of goods sold (COGS). While this severely impacts marijuana retailers, as opposed to cultivators and producers, we do face higher federal income tax liability than a non-cannabis company.

The State of Nevada, per Nevada Revised Statutes Section 372A.290, has implemented the following taxes on marijuana and marijuana products: (i) a fifteen percent (15%) excise tax on the wholesale sale which is paid by the cultivator and is calculated on the fair market value at wholesale set by the Department of Taxation, and (ii) a ten percent (10%) excise tax on the retail sale which is paid by the retail store. We are obligated to collect and remit the wholesale cultivation tax on all wholesale sales and file the appropriate tax returns on a monthly basis. We currently do not have retail operations in Nevada, and therefore are not required to collect and/or remit any retail taxes. All marijuana and marijuana products sold at retail must also pay and remit sales taxes at the applicable local sales tax level.

Distribution Methods 

In Nevada, we sell directly to licensed Nevada dispensaries. 

In Ohio, we, through NMG, have been managing the fully operational Clubhouse dispensary located in Elyria,Ohio, which is 30% owned by NMG. The Clubhouse dispensary was transferred to a 100% owned subsidiary of DEP on September 4, 2020.

In Arkansas, we, through NMG, manage the “Body and Mind” branded medical marijuana dispensary in West Memphis, Arkansas, which opened on April 27, 2020. Medical marijuana dispensaries in Arkansas allow limited cultivation and Body and Mind commenced operation of the cultivation facility in April 2021. As part of an initial cultivation program seeds were planted and clones were taken during FY2021 with initial plants moved into flowering in September 2021.

Sources and availability of raw materials

Finished Flower – In Nevada, our clones are all produced in-house from older batches of plants. Other clone sources are readily available to purchase throughout Nevada. Our coco growing medium (soil like material) is the only component of raw materials that is produced outside of our control. Coco suppliers are readily available in the event of a loss of our supplier. We produce our nutrients in-house using basic nutrients readily available in the cultivation market. Our packaging is produced overseas, and suppliers are readily available. 

Pre-Rolled Joints – In Nevada, our flower buds produce the material for our pre-rolls. All of our pre-roll packaging is easily obtained. There are numerus suppliers of joint paper, joint vials, and other joint packaging materials. In California, the source for our pre-rolled joints is tested quality flower from licensed facilities. We have relationships with licensed cultivators and there are numerous licensed cultivators who can supply flower. Our packaging is produced overseas, and suppliers are readily available. 

Concentrates – our flower is used to produce our concentrates. All the chemicals, supplies, and equipment required to produce concentrates can be easily obtained. 

Vape Cartridges – our flower and extraction process is used to produce the oil placed in vape cartridges. The vape cartridge and packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers and there are numerous suppliers that can meet our demand. The company does not use vitamin E acetate or any other artificial agent for thinning any cannabis oil products.

Distillate Oil - our flower is used to produce distillate oil. The packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers. There are plenty of suppliers that can meet our demand. All chemicals required for the distillation are common and readily available for purchase. 

Rosin – our flower is used to produce rosin. Our packaging is obtained from 3rd party suppliers and there are plenty of suppliers to meet our demand.


17


Edibles – all ingredients are locally sourced. We use our in-house produced distillate oil to infuse all the edibles. We cultivate and produce medical and recreational marijuana products such as flower, oil extracts and edibles under the brand name “Body and Mind”.

Competitive business conditions

Supply & Demand - as our competitors expand operations, there is more supply creating less demand for mid and low quality cannabis products. We continue to provide high quality products, excellent customer service, and competitive prices.

We have built our business plan around capitalizing on the medical-use and recreational cannabis market. The regulated medical-recreational use cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry that presents a unique opportunity under current market conditions. In the United States, the development and growth of the industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. 

We believe that the following conditions create an attractive opportunity for the cultivation, production and retail sales of products within the medical recreational-use cannabis industry:


· | Significant industry growth in recent years and expected continued growth; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | A shift in public opinion and increasing momentum toward the legalization of cannabis; 
· | Limited access to capital by industry participants in light of risk perceived by financial institutions of violating federal laws and regulatory guidelines for offering banking services to cannabis-related businesses;
· | Opportunity for skilled operators to transfer operational and execution experience to new facilities and operations. 


Notwithstanding the foregoing market opportunity and trends, and despite legalization at the state level, we continue to believe that the current state of federal law creates significant uncertainty and potential risks associated with investing in medical-use and recreational-use cannabis facilities.

We have a distribution licence and infrastructure to distribute our products and our primary market is in State of Nevada. 

Product Regulation 

State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a doctor’s recommendation subject to various requirements and limitations. In Nevada, an applicant of a medical-use cannabis card must obtain verification from attending provider of health care that the person has been diagnosed with a chronic or debilitating medical condition, and its symptoms may be mitigated by the medical use of marijuana. Nevada has characterized the following as “chronic or debilitating medical conditions”: acquired immune deficiency syndrome; cancer, glaucoma, a medical condition or treatment for a medical condition that produces cachexia, persistent muscle spasms, seizures, severe nausea, or severe pain. The above list may be amended or added to from time to time. Nevada extends reciprocity for non-residents who hold a valid medical-use card in their state of residence, as long as the person abides by Nevada’s legal limits on the possession. Medical-use card holders may not possess more than two and one-half ounces of usable marijuana in any one 14-day period.

In Ohio, patients must have a qualifying medical condition to be eligible for a medical-use card. Such qualifying medical conditions include: HIV/AIDS; Alzheimer’s disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); cancer; chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); Crohn’s disease; epilepsy or another seizure disorder; fibromyalgia; glaucoma; hepatitis C; inflammatory bowel disease; multiple sclerosis; pain that is chronic and severe, or intractable; Parkinson’s disease; post-traumatic stress disorder; sickle cell anemia; spinal cord disease or injury; Tourette’s syndrome; traumatic brain injury; and ulcerative colitis. Ohio prohibits smoking of medical-use cannabis, but permits oils, tinctures, plant material, edibles and patches. Ohio medical-use card holders may not possess more than a 90-day supply of medical marijuana, which is defined by form, as follows: plant material- no more than eight ounces of tier I medical marijuana, no more than five and three-tenths ounces of tier II medical marijuana; no more than twenty-six and fifty-five-hundredths grams of THC content in patches for transdermal administration or lotions, creams, or ointments for topical administration; no more than nine and nine-tenths grams of THC content in oil, tincture, capsule, or edible form for oral administration; no more than fifty-three and one-tenths grams of THC content in medical marijuana oil for vaporization.

In November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved cannabis use for adults over the age of 21 without a physician’s prescription or recommendation, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. We have obtained the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute cannabis in compliance with the laws in the State of Nevada and California. Despite the changes in state laws, cannabis remains illegal under federal law. In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“the AUMA”), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA. Nevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions.

The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.

We are monitoring the current federal administration’s, the DOJ’s and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Since the beginning of the new Congress in January 2019, there have been positive discussions about the Federal Government’s approach to cannabis. The DOJ has not signaled any change in their enforcement efforts. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in California and Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada, California, Ohio and Arkansas laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.

Competitive Conditions and Position

Production and Sales

NMG has a number of licenses and a long-term lease for a facility allowing it to cultivate, produce and distribute medical and recreational marijuana. In addition to flower products, we produce marijuana extract products such as distillate oil, ice wax, dry sift, shatter, edibles and topicals. 

19

The Nevada, California, Ohio and Arkansas Markets

We face competition from a variety of competitors. Several factors impacting competition include, but are not limited to, the quality control and consistency of products being produced, the hiring and retention of competent personnel within the industry, brand marketing and production costs.
The United States Market

We face competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including, but not limited to, independent investors, hedge funds and other cannabis operators, all of whom may compete with us to acquire real estate zoned for medical-use and/or recreational-use cannabis facilities. The current market for medical and recreational marijuana products may be limited as more competitors enter the market.

Upon entering into the Loan Agreement and the associated loan documents and agreements described below, the Lender provided the initial term loan (the “Initial Term Loan”) in the face amount of US$6,666,667 of which US$6,000,000 was advanced to the Company with the 10% representing an origination discount (the “Origination Discount”) as consideration for the use or forbearance of money. We may draw upon the remaining face amount of US$4,444,444 (the “Delayed Draw Term Loan”) upon providing a 30-day request to the Agent by December 1, 2021, whereby US$4,000,000 will be advanced to the Company after applying the Origination Discount. The Initial Term Loan and the Delayed Draw Term Loan mature on July 19, 2025 and bear interest at a rate of 13% per annum payable on the first day of each month hereafter.

Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we have issued an aggregate of 8,000,000 common stock purchase warrants (each, a “Warrant”) to the Agent of which (i) 4,800,000 Warrants will entitle the holder to acquire shares of common stock (each, a “Warrant Share”) at an exercise price of US$0.40 per Warrant Share until July 19, 2025, and (ii) 3,200,000 Warrants will be held in escrow by us and released to the Agent at the time the Company draws on the Delayed Draw Term Loan, or cancelled if we do not draw on the Delayed Draw Term Loan, which will entitle the holder to acquire a Warrant Share at an exercise price of US$0.45 per Warrant Share until July 19, 2025.

The Initial Term Loan is evidenced by a Term Note (a “Term Note”), which is attached as Exhibit C to the Loan Agreement. If the Delayed Draw Term Loan is drawn upon by us, it will also be evidenced by a separate Term Note.

Security Agreement

On July 19, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), we and the Guarantors (collectively, the “Grantors”) entered into a security agreement (the “Security Agreement”) with the Agent (acting as the agent to the Lender) (the Agent and the Lender being referred to herein as, the “Secured Parties”) wherein Grantors have granted to Secured Parties a security interest in and to certain assets of the Grantors in order to secure our obligations pursuant to the Loan Agreement. 

Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Grantors are granting to the Secured Parties a security interest in all personal property and other assets owned as of the Effective Date or acquired thereafter (the “Collateral”). Certain assets are excluded from the Collateral such as: (i) intent to use United States trademark applications; (ii) certain assets acquired with third-party financing (provided that such financing does not amortize prior to the maturity date of the Loan Agreement, matures at least 1 year after maturity of the Loan Agreement and the leverage ratio remains 3:1 following financing for such assets); and (iii) rights to licenses or contracts where granting liens is prohibited by law. 

Upon a default under the Loan Agreement, the Secured Parties may enter upon the premises of the Grantors where any Collateral is located through self-help, without judicial process, without first obtaining a final judgment or giving the Grantors or any other Person notice and opportunity for a hearing on the Secured Parties’ claim or action and may collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate and realize the Collateral, or any part thereof. In such event, the Grantors agree to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent. Until the Agent is able to effect a disposition of the Collateral, the Agent shall have the right to hold or use the Collateral, or any part thereof, to the extent that it deems appropriate in its sole discretion for the purpose of preserving the Collateral or its value or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the Agent. Agent shall not have any rights to take any action that would violate law. 

To protect the Secured Parties’ interests in the Collateral, the Grantor’s have executed a power of attorney appointing Agent as the Grantors’ attorney in fact with such power and appointment only exercisable in the event of a default under the Loan Agreement and we have further agreed to file all UCC Financing Statements evidencing the granted security interests set forth in the Security Agreement.

On July 19, 2021, we and our subsidiaries, DEP and NMG (collectively, the “Pledgors”) entered into a Pledge Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”) with the Agent (acting as the collateral agent for the Lender) (the Lender and Agent are referred to herein as, the “Secured Parties”) wherein Pledgors have pledged certain of Pledgors’ equity interests in various subsidiaries in order to secure our obligations pursuant to the Loan Agreement.

Pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, Pledgors are pledging to the Secured Parties a lien on certain equity interests in Pledgors’ subsidiaries as follows (collectively, the “Pledged Collateral”):


1) | Company is pledging to the Secured Parties all rights, privileges and interests in Company’s equity securities in DEP, which comprises of one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of DEP; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEP owns one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding equity interests in each of the DEP Pledged Subsidiaries (collectively, DEP, NMG Ohio, and the DEP Pledged Subsidiaries being, the “Pledged Entities”).


The pledge, assignment and delivery of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to the Pledge Agreement creates a valid first priority lien. Without the prior written consent of the Agent, no Pledgor will sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber any of its rights in or to the Pledged Collateral, or any unpaid dividends, interest or other distributions or payments with respect to the Pledged Collateral. 

As long as no default under the Loan Agreement has occurred and is continuing, Pledgors shall have the right to vote and give consents with respect to the Pledged Collateral for all purposes not inconsistent with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. 

Upon a default, the Agent, acting on behalf of the Secured Parties, is hereby authorized and empowered to (i) transfer the Pledged Collateral to the Secured Parties; (ii) transfer and register in its name the Pledged Collateral; (iii) exchange certificates representing Pledged Collateral for certificates of smaller or larger denominations, (iv) exercise the voting and all other rights; (v) collect and receive all cash dividends; (vi) notify the Pledged Entities to make payment to Agent of any amounts due in connection with the Pledged Collateral; (vii) endorse instruments in the name of the Pledgors to allow collection; (viii) enforce collection of any of the Pledged Collateral by suit or otherwise; (ix) sell, with notice and in accordance with applicable law, Pledged Collateral; (x) act with respect to the Pledged Collateral as though Agent was the outright owner; (xi) appoint a receiver (selected by Agent in its sole discretion) to administer the Pledged Collateral; and (xii) exercise any other rights or remedies the Secured Parties may have under the UCC or other applicable law.

(“NMG MI P1”) (collectively, the “Assignors”) entered into an Omnibus Collateral Assignment (the “Collateral Assignment”) with the Agent wherein Assignors have granted to the Agent for the benefit of the Lender certain rights, interests and privileges of Assignors in and to certain contracts in order to secure our obligations pursuant to the Loan Agreement.

Pursuant to the Collateral Assignment, Assignors have granted to the Agent for the benefit of the Lender(s) a security interest in all the rights, interests and privileges which such Assignor has or may have in or under the following contracts (the “Assigned Contracts”):

So long as no default has occurred under the Loan Agreement, each Affiliate Obligor may make payments on account of the Subordinated Debt in the ordinary course of business, solely to the extent such payments are permitted under the Loan Agreement. Upon default, no Affiliate Obligor shall make, accept or receive, any payment of Subordinated Debt Payment.

Until our satisfaction of all obligations under the loan, no subsidiary holding rights to be paid Subordinated Debt will (i) accelerate, make demand, or otherwise make due and payable prior to the original due date thereof any Subordinated Debt; (ii) exercise any rights under or with respect to guaranties of the Subordinated Debt; (iii) exercise any of its rights or remedies in connection with the Subordinated Debt; (iv) exercise any right to set-off or counterclaim in respect of any debt, contest, protest, or object to any exercise of secured creditor remedies by Agent or any Lender; (v) object to any forbearance by the Agent; (vi) commence, or cause to be commenced, and insolvency proceeding; or (vii) contest, protest, or object to any Affiliate Obligor obtaining debtor-in-possession financing.
