ITEM 1.    Business
General
We focus on providing cleaner, lower carbon transportation fuels. We are North America's largest producer of advanced biofuels. We utilize a nationwide production, distribution and logistics system as part of an integrated value chain model designed to convert natural fats, oils and greases into advanced biofuels. During 2019, we sold 700 million total gallons of fuel (including fuel purchased from third parties for resale) and generated revenues of $2.6 billion. We believe our fully integrated approach, which includes acquiring feedstock, managing biorefinery facility construction and upgrades, operating biorefineries, and distributing fuel through a network of terminals, positions us to serve the market for cleaner transportation fuels. In September 2018, we acquired Keck Energy and in July 2019, we opened our first REG branded fueling station adjacent to our biorefinery in Seneca, Illinois to serve a variety of customers from trucking fleets to local diesel vehicle owners. These are the initial parts of our downstream strategy, which is focused on three important objectives: margin expansion across the value chain, including by directing production to the most profitable geographies; realization of higher biodiesel values through blends of biodiesel into petroleum and renewable diesel; and increased demand for our biodiesel via sales of B100 to end consumers. We believe that the execution of this strategy will enable us to expand our margins, diversify sources of profitability, manage our business through varying market conditions, and increase shareholder value. 
Our businesses are organized into two reportable segments - the Biomass-based Diesel segment and the Services segment. Our Biomass-based Diesel segment includes (1) the operations of the biomass-based diesel production refineries; (2) purchases and resales of biomass-based diesel, petroleum-based diesel, RINs and LCFS credits, and raw material feedstocks acquired from third parties; (3) sales of biomass-based diesel produced under toll manufacturing arrangements with third party facilities using our feedstocks; and (4) incentives received from federal and state programs for renewable fuels. In addition to biomass-based diesel, we also sell petroleum-based heating oil and diesel fuel, which enables us to offer additional biofuel blends to a broader customer base. Our Services segment, which primarily provides services to our Biomass-based Diesel Segment, includes: (1) biomass-based diesel facility management and operational services, whereby we provide day-to-day management and operational services to biomass-based diesel production facilities and (2) construction management services, whereby we act as the construction management and general contractor for the construction or upgrade of biomass-based diesel production facilities. We derive a small portion of our revenues from the sale of co-products of the biomass-based diesel production process. In 2019 and 2018, our revenues from the sale of co-products were less than five percent of our total Biomass-based diesel segment revenues. During 2019 and 2018, revenues from the sale of petroleum-based heating oil and diesel fuel acquired from third parties, along with the sale of these items further blended with biodiesel produced by our facilities or purchased from third parties, were both approximately 10% of our total revenues. The following products accounted for 10% or more of revenues for the respective periods:

 | Fiscal Year Ended
Revenue | December 31, 2019 | December 31, 2018 | December 31, 2017
Biomass-based diesel | 78% | 76% | 71% 
Petroleum-based diesel | 10% | 10% | 7% 

Plant Network
We own and operate a network of 13 biorefineries. Eleven biorefineries are located in the United States and two in Germany. Eleven biorefineries produce biodiesel, one produces renewable diesel, and one is a fermentation facility. Our twelve biomass-based diesel production facilities have an aggregate nameplate production capacity of 505 million gallons per year ("mmgy"). In August 2019, we closed our New Boston, Texas biorefinery, which had a nameplate capacity of 15 mmgy.
We own and operate the following facilities in North America and internationally:

Total | 505 | 627.9 | | 

The nameplate capacity listed above is based on original plant design.
Effective capacity represents the maximum average throughput that satisfies certain defined technical constraints. 
Okeechobee is a demo-scale fermentation facility. 
We maintain a testing laboratory at our corporate headquarters in Ames, Iowa, for testing various feedstocks for conversion into biomass-based diesel and various new manufacturing processes to produce biomass-based diesel. We also have a regional office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, focused on maintaining and developing advanced biofuel technologies and renewable chemicals. 
We produce renewable diesel at our Geismar, Louisiana facility. Renewable diesel generally carries a premium price compared to biodiesel as a result of a variety of factors including the ability to blend it with petroleum diesel seamlessly, better cold weather performance, and because it generates more renewable identification numbers ("RINs") on a per gallon basis. We announced in January 2020 our decision to discontinue the joint effort with Phillips 66 to construct a renewable diesel plant in Ferndale, Washington. We are evaluating opportunities to further our ability to leverage our renewable diesel technology and expand renewable diesel production to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation fuels, including a potential expansion of our renewable diesel facility in Geismar, Louisiana.
Our Feedstocks and Other Inputs
We are a lower-cost, lower carbon biomass-based diesel producer. We primarily produce our biomass-based diesel from a wide variety of lower-cost, lower carbon feedstocks, including distillers corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat. We also produce biomass-based diesel from virgin vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil, which tend to be higher in price. We believe our ability to process a wide variety of feedstocks in most of our facilities provides us with a cost advantage over many biomass-based diesel producers, particularly those relying primarily on higher cost virgin vegetable oils.
We can adjust our processing in most of our facilities to accommodate different feedstocks and feedstock mixes. Our ability to use a wide range of feedstocks gives us a feedstock cost advantage over many other producers because we have the flexibility to respond to changes in feedstock pricing. In 2019, approximately 71% of our total feedstock usage was lower-cost distillers corn 
oil, used cooking oil or rendered animal fat feedstock. The remaining approximately 29% consisted of refined vegetable oils, such as soybean oil or canola oil. 
We procure our feedstocks from numerous vendors in quantities ranging from truckload to railcar to water vessel to pipeline. There is no established futures market for the lower-cost feedstocks that we utilize. Distillers corn oil is typically purchased on fixed priced contracts in forward positions of one to three months, and occasionally longer. We generally purchase used cooking oil and rendered animal fats on one to four week forward positions using fixed pricing or an indexed price compared to a published index such as USDA reports or recognized industry price reports such as The Jacobsen or Informa. Soybean and canola oils can be purchased on a spot or forward contract basis from several suppliers and pricing for these vegetable oils is compared to the broadly traded Soybean Oil Index of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
From time to time, we work with developers of next generation feedstocks, such as algae and camelina, to assist them in bringing these new feedstocks to market. We have converted several of these feedstocks, as well as other second generation feedstocks, into high quality biomass-based diesel in our laboratory and production facilities. We believe we are well positioned to incorporate many new feedstocks into our production process as they become commercially available.
We procure methanol and chemical catalysts used in our production process such as sodium methylate and hydrochloric acid, under fixed-price contracts and formula-indexed contracts based upon competitive bidding. These procurement contracts typically last from three months to one year. The price of methanol is indexed to the monthly reported published price. We also enter into a long-term supply agreement with a supplier to procure hydrogen necessary for our renewable diesel production. 
Distribution
We have established a national distribution system to supply biomass-based diesel throughout the United States. Each of our biomass-based diesel facilities is equipped with an on-site rail loading system, a truck loading system, or both. Our Seneca biorefinery near the Illinois River has direct barge access for supplying customers using the inland waterways system. Our Houston biorefinery has barge and deep-water ship loading capability. Our Grays Harbor biorefinery has deep-water capability for PANAMAX class vessels. We also manage some customers’ biomass-based diesel storage tanks and replenishment process. Our distribution performance for 2019 in North America is depicted below.
In addition, we have established an international distribution system to supply biomass-based diesel throughout Europe. Our products that are produced in Europe and in the U.S. are distributed to European customers using seas vessels, barges and trucks. Our Emden biorefinery has deep-water capabilities and can load vessels, barges and trucks. Our Oeding biorefinery can only load and unload trucks. We also have storage facilities in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Anwerp region, which allows us to distribute our products efficiently. 
As of December 31, 2019, we leased over 1,050 railcars for transportation and leased biomass-based diesel storage tanks in 45 terminals in North America and 6 terminals internationally. In general, the terminals in North America where we lease our biomass-based diesel storage tanks are largely petroleum fuel terminals so that fuel distributors and other biomass-based diesel customers can create a biomass-based diesel blend at the terminal before further distribution. Terminal contracts typically have one-to three-year terms and are generally renewable subject to certain terms and conditions. During 2019, REG sold products in 45 states in the U.S., five Canadian Provinces, and eight other countries around the world.
We sell heating oil and ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD") at terminals throughout the northeastern U.S.  We sell additional biofuel blends at terminal locations in the Midwest, West Coast and Texas. We continue to look for terminal expansion opportunities across North America.
Government Programs Favoring Biomass-Based Diesel Production and Use
The biomass-based diesel industry benefits from numerous federal and state government programs.
Renewable Fuel Standard
Biomass-based diesel has historically been more expensive to produce than petroleum-based diesel. The biomass-based diesel industry's growth has largely been the result of federal and state programs that require or incentivize production and use of biomass-based diesel, which allows biomass-based diesel to be priced competitively with petroleum-based diesel.
The RFS2 biomass-based diesel requirement became effective in 2010, requiring for the first time that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The biomass-based diesel requirement can be satisfied by two primary fuels, biodiesel and renewable diesel. Required volumes under the RFS2 program, referred to as the renewable volume obligation ("RVO"), are determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. The final RVO targets for the biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels volumes for the years 2016 to 2021 as set by the EPA are as follows:

 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 
Biomass-based diesel | 1.90 billion gallons | 2.00 billion gallons | 2.10 billion gallons | 2.10 billion gallons | 2.43 billion gallons | 2.43 billion gallons
Total Advanced biofuels | 3.61 billion RINs* | 4.28 billion RINs* | 4.29 billion RINs* | 4.92 billion RINs* | 5.04 billion RINs* | N/A 

*Ethanol equivalent gallons
The biomass-based diesel requirement is one of four separate renewable fuel requirements under RFS2. The RFS2 requirements are based on two primary categories and two subcategories. The two primary categories are conventional renewable fuel, which is primarily satisfied by corn ethanol, and advanced biofuel, which is defined as a biofuel that reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum-based fuel the biofuel is replacing. The advanced biofuel category has two subcategories, cellulosic biofuel, to be satisfied by newly developed cellulosic biofuels, such as ethanol made from woody biomass, and biomass-based diesel, which is satisfied by biodiesel and renewable diesel. RFS2’s total advanced biofuel requirement is larger than the combined cellulosic fuel and biomass-based diesel requirements, thus requiring the use of additional volumes of advanced biofuels.
The RFS2 requirement for advanced biofuels can be satisfied by any advanced biofuel, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, biogas used in transportation, biobutanol, cellulosic ethanol or sugarcane-based ethanol, so long as it meets the 50% greenhouse gas reduction requirement.
The advanced biofuel RVO is expressed in terms of ethanol equivalent volumes, or EEV, which is based on the fuel’s renewable energy content compared to ethanol. Biodiesel has an EEV of 1.5 and renewable diesel typically has an EEV of 1.7, compared to 1.0 for sugarcane-based ethanol. Accordingly, it requires less biomass-based diesel than sugarcane-based ethanol to meet the required volumes as each gallon of biomass-based diesel counts as more gallons for purposes of fulfilling the advanced biofuel RVO, providing an incentive for refiners and importers to purchase biomass-based diesel to meet their advanced biofuel RVO.
The RFS2 volume requirements apply to petroleum refiners and petroleum fuel importers in the 48 contiguous states and Hawaii, who are defined as “Obligated Parties” in the RFS2 regulations. Obligated Parties are required to incorporate into their petroleum-based fuel a certain percentage of renewable fuel or purchase credits in the form of renewable identification numbers from those who do. An Obligated Party’s RVO is based on the volume of petroleum-based fuel they produce or import. The largest United States petroleum refining companies, such as Valero, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, British Petroleum, Chevron, Shell, Marathon and Citgo, represent the majority of the total RVO, with the remainder made up of smaller refiners and importers.
Renewable Identification Numbers
The EPA created the RIN system to track renewable fuel production and compliance with the renewable fuel standard. EPA registered producers of renewable fuel may generate RINs for each gallon of renewable fuel they produce. In the case of biomass-based diesel, generally 1.5 to 1.7 biomass-based diesel RINs may be generated for each gallon of biomass-based diesel produced, based upon the fuel's renewable energy content. Renewable fuel, including biomass-based diesel, can then be sold with associated RINs attached. RINs may also be separated from the gallons of renewable fuel they represent and once separated they may be sold as a separate commodity. RINs are ultimately used by Obligated Parties to demonstrate compliance with RFS2. Obligated Parties must obtain and retire the required number of RINs to satisfy their RVO during a particular compliance period. An Obligated Party can obtain RINs by buying renewable fuels with RINs attached, buying RINs that have been separated, or producing renewable fuels themselves. All RIN activity under RFS2 must be entered into the EPA’s moderated transaction system, which tracks RIN generation, transfer and retirement. RINs are retired when used for compliance with the RFS2 requirements.
The value of RINs is significant to the price of biomass-based diesel. In 2019, RIN prices as a percentage contribution to the daily average 100% pure biodiesel (B100) spot price, as reported by the Oil Pricing Information System, or OPIS, fluctuated significantly throughout the year and ranged from a low of $0.48 per gallon, or 18% of the average B100 spot price per gallon, in May to a high of $0.97 per gallon, or 34% of the average spot price, in November. 
Biodiesel Tax Credit
The federal biodiesel mixture excise tax credit, or BTC, provides a $1.00 refundable tax credit per gallon to the first blender of biomass-based diesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The BTC can then be credited against federal excise tax liability or the blender can obtain a cash refund from the United States Treasury for the value of the credit. The BTC was first implemented on January 1, 2005 and has been allowed to lapse multiple times before being retroactively reinstated, as described in the following table:
The BTC is an incentive shared across the advanced biofuel production and distribution chain through routine, daily trading and negotiation. In December 2019, the BTC was retroactively reinstated for 2018 and 2019, and made effective from January 2020 through December 2022.
California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits
The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, regulation is a rule designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels used in California. The regulation quantifies lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by assigning a “carbon intensity” ("CI") score to each transportation fuel based on that fuel’s lifecycle assessment. Each petroleum fuel provider (generally the fuel’s producer or importer, or “regulated party”) is required to ensure that the overall CI score for its fuel pool meets the annual carbon intensity target for a given year. A regulated party’s fuel pool can include gasoline, diesel, and their blendstocks and substitutes. 
We obtain carbon credits when we sell qualified biomass-based diesel into California. During 2019, California LCFS carbon credits ranged from $175.00 per metric ton to $209.00 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS.
Oregon Clean Fuel Program
The Oregon Clean Fuel Program requires a 10% reduction of the average carbon intensity of Oregon’s transportation fuels from 2015 levels by 2025. The baseline year for the program is 2015 and represents 10% ethanol blended with gasoline and 5% biodiesel blended with diesel. The Oregon Renewable Fuels Standard requires all gasoline sold in the state to be blended with 10% ethanol (E10). In addition, all diesel fuel sold in the state must be blended with at least 5% biodiesel.
We obtain carbon credits when we sell qualified biomass-based diesel in Oregon. During 2019, Oregon OCF carbon credits ranged from $142.50 per metric ton to $170.00 per metric ton, as reported by OPIS.
Other Government Programs
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 40 states have implemented various programs that encourage the use of biomass-based diesel through blending requirements as well as various tax incentives. The chart below summarizes some of the most significant programs.

Government | Program description 
Illinois | Illinois offers an exemption from the generally applicable 6.25% sales tax on fuel for biomass-based diesel blends that incentivizes blending at 11% biomass-based diesel, or B11, through December 31, 2023. Illinois’ program has made that state one of the largest biomass-based diesel markets in the country. 
Iowa | Iowa has a retailer’s incentive for blended fuel which has been modified over time. For 2018 through 2024, retailers earn $0.035 per gallon of 5%-10% biodiesel blends and $0.055 per gallons for 11% and above biodiesel blends. Iowa also has a biomass-based diesel production incentive that provides $0.02 per gallon of production capped after the first 25 million gallons per production plant. Iowa recently enacted an increase in its excise tax on fuel, which is three cents per gallon less for 11% and above biodiesel blends than the diesel fuel tax. 
Texas | The biomass-based diesel portion of biomass-based diesel blends are exempt from Texas state excise tax, which results in a $0.20 per gallon incentive for 100% pure biodiesel. 
Minnesota | Minnesota law requires a 5% biodiesel blend except during the summer months when a 20% blend is required. 
Washington | Washington has adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends beginning at 2% biodiesel blends with incremental increases, provided certain feedstock or production minimums are met. In addition, Washington has a heating oil tax exemption for the portion of the heating oil that is biodiesel. Washington is also in the process of developing legislation on a low carbon fuel program. 
Pennsylvania | Pennsylvania has adopted legislation requiring biomass-based diesel blends beginning at 2% biodiesel blends with incremental increases, provided certain feedstock or production minimums are met. 
City of New York/ New England | In October 2016, the City of New York adopted legislation requiring 5% biomass-based diesel blends for heating oil starting on October 1, 2017 and the blend level then moves to 10% in 2025, 15% in 2030 and 20% in 2034. Regional oil heat dealers will use 50% biomass-based diesel blends by 2030 to meet home heating requirements. 
North Dakota | North Dakota offers a $0.05 per gallon sales tax incentive for retailers who sell 5% and above biodiesel blends. 
Municipal greenhouse gas reduction targets | Many cities across the United States have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes many cities with the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. 
Canada | While a number of provinces in Canada have biofuel programs (British Columbia has an LCFS, Alberta has a usage requirement, and Ontario has a usage requirement), the federal government is currently engaged in the rulemaking process on a nationwide Clean Fuel Standard, which may incorporate a number of carbon reducing policies. 

We believe that other government requirements for the use of biofuels increase demand for our biomass-based diesel within such regions and they may help increase the overall demand in addition to the RFS2 requirements. We observe that existing demand for our biofuel from Obligated Parties in connection with federal requirements may shift to regions that have use requirements or tax incentive programs.
RED Program
The Renewable Energy Directive ("RED") in the European Union ("EU") established a 10% target by 2020 for the use of renewable energy in the transport sector in EU member states. Given the existing limited market presence of alternative fuels or electromobility, the majority of the target is being achieved through biofuels.  EU member states produce yearly renewable energy action plans indicating their yearly national obligations for the use of renewable energy in the transportation sector. These national obligations progressively increased every year until achieving the 10% target in 2020. Biofuels produced from certain types of feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, benefit from an extra incentive as these feedstocks count double towards the 10% target and towards the national obligations. In 2018, the EU institutions adopted the so-called RED II, which is valid during the period from 2021 to 2030 and provides additional incentives for biofuel produced from waste feedstocks and even opens new outlets such as marine fuels. Each of the EU Member States are in the process of adopting the RED II into national legislation.
Competition
We face competition from producers and suppliers of petroleum-based diesel fuel, other biomass-based diesel producers, marketers, traders and distributors. The size of the biomass-based diesel industry is small compared to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitive differentiators are biomass-based diesel and RIN quality, supply reliability and price. In the United States and Canadian biomass-based diesel markets, we compete with independent biomass-based diesel producers as well as large, multi-product companies that have greater resources than we do. Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill Incorporated, Louis Dreyfus Commodities 
Group and Ag Processing Inc. are major international agribusiness corporations and biodiesel producers with the financial, feedstock sourcing and marketing resources to be formidable competitors in the biodiesel industry. These agribusiness competitors tend to make biodiesel from higher cost virgin vegetable oils such as soybean or canola oil, which they produce as part of their integrated agribusinesses. 
We are also in competition with several large and well capitalized producers of renewable diesel. Neste Corporation has approximately 882 million gallons of renewable diesel production capacity in Asia and Europe, a significant portion of which is imported into the United States. It is in the process of expanding its renewable diesel production capacity in Singapore. Diamond Green Diesel, LLC, a joint venture between Valero Energy Corporation and Darling Ingredients Inc., operates a 275 mmgy capacity renewable diesel facility and is in the process of expanding capacity to 675 mmgy by 2021. We also face the prospect that petroleum refiners will be increasingly competitive with us, either by converting oil refineries to produce renewable diesel or by co-processing renewable feedstock with crude oil. Several smaller petroleum refiners in the United States have effected conversions of their facilities from crude oil to renewables in the past year and some of the largest refiners have reportedly started co-processing renewable feedstocks or have announced plans to do so. If refinery conversions accelerate or if co-processing expands significantly, the competition we face could increase significantly. 
We also face competition in the biomass-based diesel RIN compliance market from producers of renewable diesel and in the advanced biofuel RIN compliance market from producers of other advanced biofuels, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol producers and producers of biogas used in transportation. Competition from imported biodiesel changed significantly in 2018, when the International Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Commerce imposed countervailing duties against unfairly subsidized biodiesel exports to the U.S. from Argentina and Indonesia. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration ("EIA") data, biodiesel imports from Argentina decreased from 437 million gallons in 2016 to 280 million gallons in 2017 and no imports entered the U.S. since August 2017.  Biodiesel imports from Indonesia totaled 107 million gallons in 2016 and no imports have been reported since December 2016. However, renewable diesel imports from Singapore to the U.S. have maintained a steady rate. Imports from Singapore totaled 189 million gallons in 2017, 173 million gallons in 2018, and 252 million gallons in 2019.
In our marketing and distribution operations, besides the integrated producers, we are also faced with competition from biomass-based diesel traders such as Lincoln Energy, NGL, BP, Shell, Vitol and others. The integrated producers and traders at times may have advantages because of logistics, feedstock accessibility and price, geographical location to customers, blending infrastructure, financial resources, and risk appetite. These same trading companies may have greater financial resources than we do and are able to take significant biomass-based diesel positions in the marketplace. These competitors are often customers and/or suppliers of ours as well.
Risk Management
The prices for feedstocks and biomass-based diesel, including the value associated with government incentives, can be volatile and are not always closely correlated. Lower-cost feedstocks are particularly difficult to risk manage given that such feedstocks are not traded in any public futures market. To manage feedstock and biomass-based diesel price risks, we utilize forward contracting, hedging and other risk management strategies, including the use of futures, swaps, options and over-the-counter products.
In establishing our risk management strategies, we draw from our own in-house risk management expertise and consult with industry experts. We utilize research conducted by outside firms to provide additional market information and risk management strategies. We believe combining these sources of knowledge, experience and expertise expands our view of the fluctuating commodity markets for raw materials and energy to improve our risk management strategies.
Seasonality and Working Capital Needs
Our operating results and working capital needs are influenced by seasonal fluctuations in the price of and demand for biodiesel. Seasonal fluctuations may be based on both the weather and the status of both the BTC and RVO. 
Demand may be higher in the quarters leading up to the expiration of the BTC as customers seek to purchase biomass-based diesel when they can benefit from the agreed upon value sharing of the BTC with producers. This higher demand prompted by an expiring BTC has often resulted in reduced demand for biodiesel in the following quarter. In addition, RIN prices may also be subject to seasonal fluctuations. The RIN is dated for the calendar year in which it is generated. Since 20% of an Obligated Party's annual RVO can be satisfied by prior year RINs, most RINs must come from biofuel produced or imported during the RVO year. As a result, RIN prices can be expected to increase as the calendar year progresses if the RIN market is undersupplied compared to that year's RVO and decrease if it is oversupplied.
Seasonal fluctuation in our business also occurs in the colder months when historically there has been reduced demand for biodiesel in northern and eastern United States markets, which are some of the primary markets in which we operate. Biodiesel typically has a higher cloud point than petroleum-based diesel or renewable diesel. The cloud point is the temperature below 
which a fuel exhibits a noticeable cloudiness and eventually gels, leading to fuel handling and performance problems for customers and suppliers. Reduced demand in the winter for our higher cloud point biodiesel may result in excess supply of such higher cloud point biodiesel and lower prices for such higher cloud point biodiesel. To mitigate some of these seasonal fluctuations in demand, we have upgraded our Newton and Danville biorefineries to produce distilled biodiesel which improves cold-weather performance.
Environmental Matters
Our manufacturing facilities, like other fuel and chemical production facilities, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; ecological and natural resources; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the public. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with numerous environmental permits to construct and operate each facility. They can require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to human health and the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions could result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and or facility shutdowns. We do not currently have any environmental proceedings either pending or threatened against our facilities that would materially affect our business or financial condition. Furthermore, we do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements as presently in effect.
History
Our predecessor, REG Biofuels, LLC, formerly named REG Biofuels Inc., which was formerly named Renewable Energy Group, Inc., was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 2006 upon acquiring the assets and operations of the biodiesel division of West Central Cooperative, or West Central, and two of West Central’s affiliated companies, InterWest, L.C. and REG, LLC. West Central is now known as Landus Cooperative. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 731 employees in the U.S. and 98 international employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of U.S. and international patents and expect to file additional patent applications as we continue to pursue technological innovations. We have also developed trade secrets to protect our production know-how, particularly in the field of processing low-cost feedstocks.
