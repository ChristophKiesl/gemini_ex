Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel, proprietary, synthetic small molecules for the treatment of brain and nervous system disorders. We focus our efforts on targeting and modulating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, or NMDArs, which are vital to normal and effective function of the brain and nervous system. We believe leveraging the therapeutic advantages of the differentiated modulatory mechanism of our compounds will drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of disorders of the brain and nervous system.
We are advancing a pipeline of distinct product candidates derived from our NMDAr modulator discovery platform, or the discovery platform. 
NYX-2925 is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of chronic pain. NYX-2925 is being evaluated in two Phase 2b studies in two chronic pain conditions: one evaluating the efficacy and safety in 229 patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or painful DPN, and the other evaluating the efficacy and safety in 305 patients with fibromyalgia. The Phase 2b study of NYX-2925 in patients with painful DPN completed enrollment in October 2021. The Phase 2b study of NYX-2925 in fibromyalgia completed enrollment in February 2022.
NYX-783 is in Phase 2b clinical development for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. In April 2021, we completed a Type C meeting with the FDA and finalized the design of the Phase 2b development program for NYX-783 in patients with PTSD. The Phase 2b program will consist of two studies to evaluate NYX-783 at two different dose levels. 
NYX-458 is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of cognitive impairment. NYX-458 is being evaluated in an exploratory Phase 2 study in approximately 100 patients with cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.

Our discovery platform is based on extensive original research into a novel way of modulating NMDArs. NMDArs are a subclass of receptors for glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and are responsible for the patterns of connectivity in the brain that arise from repeated signal transmission. They underly a range of basic processes such as learning, memory, and the cognitive control of pain and emotion, and are involved in a number of nervous system disorders. In particular, hypo-functioning of NMDA receptors in specific parts of the brain is implicated in a variety of neurological disorders, including each of the indications in our development pipeline.
​
Our molecules bind in a previously uncharacterized binding domain, or “pocket,” on NMDArs that is distinct from that of other NMDAr-targeted therapies. The mechanism by which our molecules positively modulate NMDArs triggers a cascade of activity that ultimately strengthens the synaptic connections between neural cells, resulting in stronger connections over time between these cells. The communication between neural cells is not only essential to routine function of the nervous system, but also allows the cells of the nervous system to learn, or adapt in response to external stimuli, through a process called synaptic plasticity. We believe our therapeutic approach, which positively modulates NMDArs to enhance synaptic plasticity, affecting learning and memory processes, holds great promise for alleviating multiple disorders of the brain and nervous system, such as chronic pain, PTSD, and cognitive impairment.
​
The foundation of our proprietary discovery platform is the ability to modulate NMDArs in a highly specific and selective manner to enhance synaptic plasticity. Rather than fully turning the receptor “on” (agonism) or “off” (antagonism), we believe our approach effectively normalizes NMDAr function, enhancing communication between neural cells and avoiding the issues associated with excessive unidirectional activation or inhibition that have limited NMDAr-targeted drug development historically.
​
In clinical studies, compounds generated from our discovery platform penetrate the blood brain barrier to achieve brain concentration levels consistent with levels observed at doses that had significant effects in various preclinical animal models. These product candidates are orally bioavailable, potentially suitable for once-daily dosing, and have favorable tolerability profiles with little to no significant adverse events in studies completed to date. We believe these clinical data suggest that product candidates from our discovery platform may have wide dose ranges that are both safe and well tolerated.
​
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative therapies for disorders of the brain and nervous system with significant unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to:

● | Advance the development of NYX-2925 as a novel treatment for chronic centralized pain conditions. We believe NYX-2925, if approved, could be an important potential therapy for chronic pain with mechanistic innovations that address significant unmet medical needs. Across all Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of NYX-2925 completed to date, it has been well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events reported. We have completed two exploratory Phase 2a studies of NYX-2925. In our completed exploratory Phase 2a study in painful DPN, NYX-2925 demonstrated analgesic activity. Further, in our completed exploratory Phase 2a neuroimaging biomarker study in fibromyalgia, NYX-2925 demonstrated relevant brain activity and analgesic activity. Together, data from these first-in-patient studies inform and support the future development of NYX-2925 for the treatment of chronic pain, including our currently ongoing follow-up Phase 2b studies in painful DPN and fibromyalgia.

● | Advance the development of NYX-783 as a novel treatment for PTSD. We believe NYX-783, if approved, could represent a transformative therapeutic option in PTSD that enhances fear extinction learning and the cognitive control of emotion involved in alleviating the traumatic response that persists in people with PTSD well after a traumatic event or experience, while also addressing the core symptoms and major comorbidities of the disorder. To date, we have completed a Phase 1 study and an

exploratory Phase 2a study with NYX-783. Across both studies, NYX-783 has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile with no drug-related serious adverse events reported. In the exploratory Phase 2a study, we observed encouraging activity on PTSD symptoms. These observations have informed the currently ongoing Phase 2b program and continued development of NYX-783 as a treatment for patients with PTSD.

● | Advance the development of NYX-458 as a novel treatment for cognitive impairment. Based on compelling data in a relevant, translatable, non-human primate model of Parkinson’s disease-related cognitive impairment, we believe NYX-458, if approved, may offer substantial improvements over existing treatments for cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. In a completed Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, NYX-458 demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile across a wide dose range. NYX-458 is currently under evaluation in a first-in-patient exploratory Phase 2 study in patients in with cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. We expect the results of this study will inform future development of NYX-458.

● | Continue to expand our pipeline by leveraging our NMDAr modulator discovery platform, building on and extending our leadership in NMDAr biology. We intend to use our discovery platform to develop a broad pipeline and product portfolio across an array of disorders of the brain and nervous system. Our pipeline is fueled by our library of over 1,000 unique, synthesized, small-molecule NMDAr modulators derived through our extensive original research and the discovery of a novel binding domain that we believe could allow for safe and effective enhancement of synaptic plasticity. All of these compounds have been designed to meet favorable central nervous system, or CNS, safety and pharmacokinetic, or PK, criteria. We also plan to continue seeking NMDAr-dependent biomarkers which could help to inform the development of our future product candidates.

● | Optimize the development and commercial potential of our product candidates. We own the worldwide commercial rights to NYX-2925, NYX-783, and NYX-458 in our selected indications. Our primary strategy is to independently pursue the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We have assembled an experienced management team that is capable of executing along the entire value chain of drug development and commercialization. As we continue to build and develop our product portfolio, we may opportunistically pursue strategic partnerships that maximize the value of our pipeline.

Product Candidates From our Discovery Platform
The following table summarizes the current development status of our pipeline of wholly owned product candidates generated from our discovery platform: 

While all of our product candidates and the other molecules from our discovery platform modulate NMDArs, they are distinct chemical entities with different pharmacologic properties. Each of our molecules binds uniquely within the binding domain, resulting in a variety of activity, potency, and NMDAr-subtype selectivity profiles. We evaluate the therapeutic implications of these variations by interrogating our molecules across different preclinical models of brain and nervous system disorders. The data we collect from these preclinical studies indicate which molecules are better suited for different indications and inform our development decisions accordingly.
NYX-2925 for the Treatment of Chronic Centralized Pain Conditions
NYX-2925 is a novel, oral, small molecule NMDAr positive allosteric modulator being developed for the treatment of chronic pain. NYX-2925 works by enhancing synaptic plasticity in the brain, a mechanism that is differentiated from any therapy currently used for the treatment of chronic pain. This approach is uniquely suited to treat centralized chronic pain as it is established that, when pain becomes chronic, it becomes increasingly centrally (brain) mediated. In normal pain processing, a stimulus is sensed by peripheral nerves and signal is relayed to the spinal cord, ultimately leading to the brain perceiving the stimulus as painful. When this process is experienced chronically, hyper-sensitivity and overactivity can emerge in the periphery, in the spinal cord, and in the brain. Changes in the brain include abnormalities in the cognitive control of pain perception and processing pathways, and reduced descending inhibition of pain signals. These changes together can increase pain perception, including the perception of pain in the absence of normally painful stimuli. Beyond our lead indications for NYX-2925—painful DPN and fibromyalgia—additional chronic pain conditions have been associated with aberrant centralized pain processing and we believe the mechanism of action of NYX-2925 makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of numerous chronic pain conditions.
In a Phase 1 study in healthy adult volunteers, NYX-2925 demonstrated a predictable, dose dependent, and linear PK profile with no accumulation after multiple daily doses and was well-tolerated with no drug related serious adverse events. As evaluated through cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, exposure, NYX-2925 adequately crosses the blood brain barrier. In Phase 1 studies, NYX-2925 enhanced various measures of sleep architecture, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and total NREM sleep duration (without altering REM sleep). NYX-2925 was also shown to acutely enhance NMDAR-dependent mismatch negativity (MMN) and quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) changes along with auditory long-term plasticity changes were seen across the dose levels.

Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy
The development of NYX-2925 in painful DPN has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
Prevalence and Market Opportunity
Painful DPN is one of the most common complications among people with diabetes. We estimate that, of the more than 30 million people in the United States with diabetes, approximately 8.5 million of them suffer from painful DPN. Painful DPN initially presents as peripheral nerve damage caused by sustained elevated glucose levels, resulting in highly localized pain in the hands and feet (often referred to as “glove and stocking” pain). As this pain persists, it has been shown that the processing of this pain moves from sensory regions in the brain to the emotional and learning and memory regions of the brain. 
The current pharmacotherapies for painful DPN are antiepileptics, antidepressants, and opioids, all of which have significant drawbacks including limited efficacy in a broad patient population, substantial side effects, and risk of abuse or addiction. The limited efficacy and substantial side effects associated with these therapies leave substantial unmet medical need in treating these patients, and we believe NYX-2925, if approved, could offer meaningful improvements on both safety and efficacy in the treatment of painful DPN.
Phase 2b Clinical Study Currently in Progress
We initiated a Phase 2b clinical study of NYX-2925 in patients with painful DPN in 2019 and, following a temporary suspension of enrollment in March 2020 due to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommenced this study in late December 2020. The Phase 2b study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NYX-2925 in patients with advanced DPN. The study completed enrollment in October 2021 with a total of 229 adult patients. Following a screening period, eligible patients are randomized to receive oral doses of NYX-2925 50 mg or placebo once daily over the treatment period. The primary endpoint in the study is the change from baseline in average daily pain score over a 12-week period as reported on the patient-reported numeric rating scale, or NRS, on which pain severity is rated from zero to ten. Multiple secondary endpoints related to pain and patient quality of life are also being evaluated. The graphic below depicts the design of this ongoing Phase 2b study.

Previously Completed Phase 2 Clinical Study
In January 2019, we completed an exploratory Phase 2a clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of NYX-2925 in adult patients with painful DPN. The data generated from this study informed and supported further development of NYX-2925 for the treatment of chronic pain, specifically with regard to the appropriate dose, patient population, and design to evaluate in subsequent studies. 
This initial exploratory Phase 2a study of NYX-2925 was a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 300 adult patients across 35 U.S.-based sites. Over the four-week treatment period, patients received daily oral doses of either placebo or NYX-2925. Placebo and multiple dose levels of NYX-2925 were evaluated, including 10 mg, 50 mg, and 200 mg. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 manner across the four arms of the study. 
Pain was assessed using the patient-reported 10-point NRS and recorded daily on a provided hand-held device. The study assessed daily pain scores at baseline (for seven days prior to treatment) and throughout the study duration with the primary endpoint being the change in pain score from baseline to week four, the final week of treatment. Additional endpoints measured a range of other physical and psychological parameters.

Results
In the Phase 2a painful DPN study, NYX-2925 exhibited a favorable tolerability profile with only placebo-like side effects and no treatment-related serious adverse events. Of the three dose levels evaluated, the 50 mg dose showed the most robust improvements across multiple measures—consistent with previous clinical and preclinical data suggesting the potential for an inverted “U-shaped” dose response with this mechanism. The 50 mg dose did not appear to have plateaued in effect by week four, suggesting that a longer treatment period may result in continued improvement and larger drug effect. The graph on the left below summarizes the top-line results in the total efficacy population (N=300) on the primary endpoint, average NRS pain score over the prior 24 hours, compared to placebo. While statistically significant separation from placebo was not achieved in the total study population, there was numeric separation from placebo and a clinically meaningful reduction in mean average daily pain score from baseline observed at week 4. Further, in a pre-specified analysis, patients not taking a concomitant analgesic medication (N=148) showed a greater separation on average daily pain scores from placebo. The graph on the right below shows the change in average pain compared to placebo in only those patients who were not taking a concomitant analgesic medication. Given that this was 

10



the first evaluation of NYX-2925 in patients with painful DPN, the p-values shown below are not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

Note: All changes reflect change from baseline in least squares mean using a mixed effects repeated measures model. 
In March 2019, we announced results from the detailed analysis of the full dataset from the study, which identified a highly mechanistically relevant sub-group of patients in which NYX-2925 demonstrated a much greater treatment benefit. In this retrospective analysis, patients with advanced DPN, or DPN for four years or longer, showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in average daily pain and also showed consistent robust improvements across the other endpoints measured in the study. This sub-group of patients is particularly relevant to the mechanism by which NYX-2925 is proposed to act. It is established that, as pain becomes chronic, it becomes increasingly centrally mediated and characterized by disrupted central processing in the brain. We believe the proposed mechanism of NYX-2925 addresses the increasingly centralized pain perceived by advanced DPN patients when they experience prolonged chronic pain over a long period of time. This patient sub-group is not only mechanistically relevant, but also substantial in size, representing over 42% of the entire study population and allowing for rigorous analysis.
The graph on the left below depicts the change from baseline in average daily pain in the advanced DPN patient sub-group. Further, advanced DPN patients not taking a concomitant analgesic medication demonstrated even more pronounced separation from placebo. 

Note: All changes reflect difference in least squares mean change from baseline using a mixed effects repeated measures model.

These significant improvements were observed consistently across other endpoints measured in the study, including worst daily pain, pain on walking, daily sleep interference, and others.
Based on the safety and efficacy profile exhibited in the study, we believe NYX-2925 has potential to address major unmet needs in the treatment of chronic pain. 
Fibromyalgia 
Prevalence and market opportunity
Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition associated with widespread pain and tenderness, as well as general fatigue. Fibromyalgia is considered by many to be a condition that is largely mediated in the central nervous system, given that fibromyalgia sufferers often present without a direct peripheral insult or injury. People suffering from fibromyalgia also often experience sleep disruption, depressed mood, and cognitive impairment. It is estimated that, in the United States, fibromyalgia affects more than 8 million people, with some estimates ranging much higher. Currently, there are only three FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for fibromyalgia, but they have limited efficacy and burdensome side effects in many patients.
Phase 2b Clinical Study Currently in Progress
In 2019 we initiated a Phase 2b clinical study of NYX-2925 in patients with fibromyalgia. Following a temporary suspension of enrollment in this study in March 2020 due to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommenced enrollment in September 2020. The Phase 2b study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NYX-2925 in patients with fibromyalgia. The study completed enrollment in February 2022 with a total of 305 adult patients. Following a screening period, eligible patients are randomized to receive oral doses of NYX-2925 50 mg, NYX-2925 100 mg, or placebo once daily over the treatment period. The primary endpoint in the study is the change from baseline in average daily pain score over a 12-week period as reported on the patient-reported 10-point NRS. Multiple secondary endpoints related to pain, fatigue, cognitive performance, and patient quality of life are also evaluated. The graphic below depicts the design of this ongoing Phase 2b study

Previously Completed Phase 2a Neuroimaging Biomarker Study
In June 2019, we completed an exploratory Phase 2a neuroimaging biomarker study in patients with fibromyalgia. The study was a single-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating placebo, NYX-2925 20 mg, and NYX-2925 200 mg in sequential two-week periods of daily dosing. 22 adult patients were enrolled across two academic sites in the U.S.
The goal of the study was to determine whether daily dosing of NYX-2925 in patients with fibromyalgia changes certain biomarkers of central pain processing using various neuroimaging techniques, including fMRI. We also evaluated additional endpoints, including daily pain scores, and a range of other physical and psychological parameters. Each subject served as her own control, receiving both placebo and NYX-2925 over the course of the six-week study. 
Results
We reported in June 2019 that administration of NYX-2925 resulted in statistically significant effects on the primary endpoint, brain activity biomarkers associated with central pain processing. Specifically, NYX-2925 was shown to reduce pain-evoked glutamate release in the insular cortex, significantly reduce combined glutamate and glutamine levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and change other connectivity patterns associated with central pain processing. In aggregate, these data demonstrate that NYX-2925 has an antinociceptive profile and is acting in the brain on the specific markers that have been shown to be associated with fibromyalgia and centralized pain processing. 

In addition to the positive results shown on the primary imaging endpoints, NYX-2925 also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements on the secondary, patient-reported endpoints, including daily pain scores, fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, and fatigue. In the study, NYX-2925 demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile with no drug-related serious adverse events reported and an overall placebo-like adverse event profile. 
In November 2019, the results from this study were presented at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting. The results from this study have provided support to advance NYX-2925 in development for the treatment of fibromyalgia.
Future Development
We intend to advance NYX-2925 toward regulatory approval for the treatment of painful DPN and fibromyalgia. In addition, we intend to pursue broader chronic pain indications for NYX-2925, such as chronic neuropathic lower-back pain and osteoarthritic pain.
In addition to pursing FDA approval in the United States in these indications, we also plan to explore registrations outside of the United States in the most significant markets, including but not limited to the Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and large emerging markets such as China.
NYX-783 for the Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
NYX-783 is a novel, oral, small-molecule NMDAr positive allosteric modulator in development for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Preclinical data suggest that NYX-783 may accelerate fear extinction and inhibit spontaneous fear recurrence, potentially addressing a key underlying learning and memory dysfunction associated with PTSD. In a Phase 1 study in healthy adult volunteers, NYX-783 demonstrated a predictable, dose dependent, and linear PK profile with no accumulation after multiple daily doses and was well-tolerated with no drug related serious adverse events. As evaluated through cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, exposure, NYX-783 adequately crosses the blood brain barrier and achieves CNS concentration levels in line with the most efficacious preclinical doses with a similar plasma-to-brain concentration ratio as that observed in rats. In our exploratory Phase 2 study in patients with PTSD, completed in October 2020, a favorable tolerability profile and promising improvements across numerous PTSD symptoms were observed in patients receiving NYX-783. The data yielded by the studies completed to date suggest that NYX-783 has the potential to address numerous unmet medical needs in the treatment of PTSD. 

13



The development of NYX-783 for the treatment of PTSD has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA and we believe NYX-783, if approved, may represent a significant improvement over current treatments for PTSD.
Phase 2b Clinical Program Currently in Progress
In April 2021, we completed a Type C meeting with the FDA and finalized the design of the Phase 2b development program for NYX-783 in patients with PTSD. The Phase 2b program will consist of two separate studies to evaluate NYX-783 at two different dose levels: 50 mg (Study 1) and 150 mg (Study 2). The 50 mg dose performed best in the previous exploratory Phase 2a study and the 150 mg dose has been selected to evaluate the effects of a higher dose level. 
​
The Phase 2b studies will be multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel design studies in patients with moderate to severe PTSD, as characterized by criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). The studies will enroll a broad and representative group of patients who have experienced various types of trauma, including both military-related and civilian PTSD. Patients with a wide range of time since trauma will be included, with stratification of enrollment to ensure balanced representation of time since trauma in the study treatment groups. Patients enrolled in the studies will not be taking concomitant PTSD medication or undergoing specific forms of trauma-focused psychotherapy.
​
The primary efficacy endpoint of each study will be the change from baseline in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for the DSM-5 (CAPS-5) Total score. Key secondary endpoints in both studies will include various measures of global impression of severity and improvement (CGI-S, CGI-I, PGI-S, PGI-I).
​
In Study 1, approximately 300 patients will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: placebo or NYX-783 50 mg administered orally once daily. The study will comprise a 1- to 4-week screening period, a 10-week treatment period, and a follow-up evaluation period. In Study 2, approximately 300 patients will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: placebo or NYX-783 150 mg administered orally once daily. The other design parameters of Study 2 will be consistent with those of Study 1. 
​
The graphic below depicts the design of this ongoing Phase 2b program.

Prevalence and Market Opportunity
It is estimated that 6% of the adult population in the United States will develop PTSD in their lifetime and approximately 15 million adults have PTSD during a given year in the United States. Many of these people are currently untreated or poorly treated due to the lack of safe and effective options. To date, only two pharmacotherapies have been approved to 

14



treat PTSD and both are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI, antidepressants that have limited efficacy in treating the symptoms of PTSD.
Previously Completed Exploratory Phase 2a Clinical Study
In October 2020, we completed an exploratory Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of NYX-783 in patients with PTSD. The study was designed as an initial signal detection study to inform future development of NYX-783 with regard to the most appropriate dosing regimen, enrollment criteria, endpoints, and powering to best assess the overall effect of NYX-783 on PTSD symptoms. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) study and enrolled 160 adult patients. Seven of the patients were enrolled under a prior protocol version which included a weekly dose; therefore, those seven subjects were not included in the efficacy analysis population. After confirming eligibility and PTSD diagnosis, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 10 mg NYX-783, or 50 mg NYX-783 once daily over the course of the study. The study consisted of two four-week treatment periods (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and no patient received NYX-783 for more than four weeks over the course of the study. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was the improvement from baseline on the Total score and symptom cluster scores of the CAPS-5. The CAPS-5 measures a Total score and individual scores for each PTSD symptom cluster (Arousal & Reactivity, Negative Cognitions & Mood, Intrusive Memories, and Avoidance), allowing us to evaluate the effects of NYX-783 on overall symptoms as well as the individual symptom domains. 
The exploratory study leveraged a SPCD comprising two stages, each four weeks in duration. In Stage 1, patients were randomized to placebo, 10 mg NYX-783, or 50 mg NYX-783, with an overweighting to placebo. At the completion of Stage 1, placebo responders and non-responders were identified and segmented in a blinded fashion according to pre-specified response criteria and each group was then re-randomized to placebo, 10 mg NYX-783, or 50 mg NYX-783 in Stage 2. Patients who received NYX-783 in Stage 1 received placebo in Stage 2. The primary analysis population for efficacy in this study included the groups on NYX-783 and placebo from Stage 1 and the placebo non-responder group from Stage 2. The design of this study is depicted below. 

Results
Administration of NYX-783 resulted in encouraging data on multiple PTSD symptom scales evaluated in the study. In the study, the 50 mg NYX-783 group showed a clinically meaningful improvement from baseline on CAPS-5 Total score. In addition, a significantly greater proportion of patients achieved a Clinically Reliable Change (improvement of ≥13 points on the CAPS-5 Total score) in the 50 mg treatment group compared to placebo. In the study, NYX-783 demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile with no drug-related serious adverse events reported. Overall the adverse event profile was similar to that observed with placebo and the adverse events that were observed with NYX-783 were 

15



mild to moderate in nature. As this study was the first evaluation of NYX-783 in patients with PTSD, all statistical analyses in the Phase 2 study represent 1-sided analysis and given its exploratory nature, the p-values described are not adjusted for multiple comparisons as is typical with studies of this stage and nature. 
The table below illustrates the key endpoints from the study, demonstrating activity with the 50 mg dose across a number of endpoints. In particular, these effects were evident in Stage 1 of the study, which is most consistent with the design of our ongoing Phase 2b program (i.e., a standard, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-design). Further, while the SPCD employed in this study was intended to mitigate the anticipated high placebo effects often observed in psychiatric studies, certain factors contributed to making the Stage 2 data more difficult to interpret and, ultimately, less informative for future studies. Thus, we primarily relied upon the data from Stage 1 for interpretation of the signal observed in the study and for informing the design of the Phase 2b studies.

The graphs below demonstrate the signals observed on the CAPS-5 Total score. The 43% improvement observed with the 50 mg dose (left panel) reflects a clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in four weeks. We believe it provides evidence of the potential for NYX-783 to outperform placebo in a longer, well-powered study with greater emphasis on operational measures to mitigate placebo effects and variability. This exploratory study was of a small size which can commonly lead to imbalances of the patients’ characteristics at baseline. In our study, we saw such baseline imbalances in symptom severity and in time since trauma which are relevant moderators of the clinical effect. When taking these imbalances into account statistically, the 50 mg dose of NYX-783 did separate from placebo by a statistically significant margin.

16



In addition, a responder analysis showed a consistent outcome on the CAPS-5 Total score. Response was defined as an improvement of 13 points or more from baseline, which is regarded to be beyond the natural fluctuation of symptoms in PTSD. This difference is referred to in published literature as “clinically reliable change.” In this analysis, nearly 75% of the patients receiving 50 mg achieved a “clinically reliable change” at week 4, compared to only 43% of those receiving placebo.
​

17



The CAPS-5 comprises four symptom clusters that were also evaluated separately as part of the pre-specified primary analysis in the study. In the Phase 2 exploratory study in PTSD patients, NYX-783 exhibited robust reductions from baseline (> 40%) across three of the four symptom clusters, with the greatest separation from placebo observed on the Negative Cognitions & Mood and Arousal & Reactivity clusters. We believe the consistency of the improvements observed across the clusters provides further support for the strength of the overall signal with NYX-783. The effects observed across all four symptoms clusters are summarized below.

We believe the totality of the data observed in this study support the continued development of NYX-783 for the treatment of PTSD. 
Future Development
We intend to advance NYX-783 toward regulatory approval for the treatment of PTSD. In addition, we may pursue other neuropsychiatric indications for NYX-783, potentially including substance use disorders in which the enhancement of extinction learning processes observed with NYX-783 may offer therapeutic benefits.
In addition to pursing FDA approval in the United States in these indications, we also plan to explore registrations outside of the United States in the most significant markets, including but not limited to the European Union, Japan, Canada, Australia, and large emerging markets such as China.
NYX-458 for the Treatment of Cognitive Impairment
NYX-458 is a novel, oral, small-molecule NMDAr positive allosteric modulator in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of cognitive impairment. Mechanistic rationale and compelling preclinical data in numerous models of cognitive impairment suggest NYX-458 may be suited to treat cognitive deficits associated with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Following the successful completion of a Phase 1 safety study in healthy volunteers, in December 2019 we initiated an exploratory Phase 2 study in patients with cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease. Due to challenges introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 we suspended enrollment of new patients in this study. In April 2021, we recommenced patient screening in the Phase 2 study to enroll patients with cognitive impairment associated with either Parkinson’s disease or dementia with Lewy bodies. Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies share a common disease pathology that contributes to cognitive deficits.
In April 2019, we reported the results of a Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic study of NYX-458. In the randomized, placebo-controlled study, which included 62 healthy volunteers, single and multiple ascending oral doses of NYX-458 were evaluated across a 20-fold dose range—10 mg to 200 mg. Across the study, including in a cohort of elderly 

18



volunteers, NYX-458 demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported and no adverse events leading to discontinuation. Further, NYX-458 demonstrated a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile and no meaningful accumulation was observed with seven daily doses. As evaluated through cerebral spinal fluid drug concentration, NYX-458 demonstrated CNS exposure in line with that observed at preclinically active doses. We believe the highly predictable nature of this pharmacokinetic profile enables accurate dose selection to achieve appropriate therapeutic exposure in clinical development. 
Prevalence and Market Opportunity
Parkinson’s disease is believed to be the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, behind Alzheimer’s disease. According to the Parkinson’s Foundation, Parkinson’s disease affects approximately one million people in the United States and nearly ten million worldwide. It is estimated that there are nearly 60,000 new cases of Parkinson’s disease diagnosed annually in the United States and, as the population continues to age, it is anticipated that the prevalence of Parkinson’s disease will continue to grow. The emergence and progression of cognition-related symptoms in Parkinson’s disease can vary due to the diverse underlying pathology of the disease. Mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, is an early non-motor symptom and affects 15% to 25% of newly diagnosed patients. It is estimated that approximately 30% of people living with Parkinson’s disease have Parkinson’s disease dementia, or PDD, and studies estimate that, as people with Parkinson’s disease approach ten years post-diagnosis, 75% will have PDD. Based on these percentages, we estimate there are more than 500,000 people in the United States with either Parkinson’s disease with mild cognitive impairment or PDD.
While patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease initially present with movement disorder symptoms that precede their cognitive symptoms, patients diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) initially present with cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. Cognitive impairments associated with Parkinson’s disease and DLB are together classified under the umbrella term, Lewy body dementias (LBDs). LBDs are estimated to affect approximately 1.4 million people in the U.S.
Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies have been shown to share a common pathology, caused by abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain. Studies have shown that these increases in alpha-synuclein inhibit NMDA receptor activity, leading to decreased cognitive performance. We believe that, if approved, NYX-458 has the potential to improve the cognitive performance of these patients through the enhancement of NMDA receptor activity. 
Exploratory Phase 2 Clinical Study Currently in Progress
Following the COVID-19-driven suspension of enrollment in the previously initiated exploratory Phase 2 study of NYX-458 in patients with Parkinson’s cognitive impairment, we made certain adjustments to the study to simplify its design and to evaluate NYX-458 in a broader patient population with LBDs that share a common underlying pathophysiology. The study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-design, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and potential cognitive benefits of NYX-458 in approximately 100 patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease or prodromal or manifest dementia with Lewy bodies. Patients in the study receive daily oral dosing of either NYX-458 30 mg or placebo over a 12-week period. The study evaluates the overall safety and tolerability of NYX-458 in patients, as well as the potential cognitive benefits of NYX-458 assessed across multiple neurocognitive endpoints focused on attention, memory, and executive function. We recommenced enrollment the exploratory Phase 2 study in April 2021. The study design is depicted below.

Previously Completed Study in a Non-human Primate Model of Parkinson’s Disease Cognitive Impairment
We have evaluated NYX-458 in a preclinical study in a non-human primate model of Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment. This model is relevant and translatable, as it evaluates the product candidate’s effects in non-human primates by employing the neurotoxin MPTP to deplete dopamine-producing neuronal cells (similar to the way Parkinson’s disease does in humans) and measuring cognitive function using a battery of tests also used in human clinical studies. In our preclinical study using this model, oral administration of NYX-458 resulted in a reversal of MPTP-induced cognitive impairment and, on some measures, restored cognitive function back to pre-MPTP healthy baseline levels. 
Future development
We intend to develop NYX-458 toward regulatory approval for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment and dementia with Lewy bodies. 
Based on results in a variety of preclinical models of cognitive impairment and an understanding of NYX-458’s mechanism, we believe NYX-458 has the potential to be an effective treatment for cognitive impairment across a variety of etiologies. In the wake of the results of the exploratory Phase 2 study currently in progress, we may seek to expand clinical development to other diseases associated with cognitive impairment.
Competition
Overview
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large and growing markets for pain, PTSD, Parkinson’s disease, and other disorders of the brain and nervous system make them attractive therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical businesses. While we believe that our employees and consultants, scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Several of these entities have commercial products, robust drug pipelines, readily available capital, and established research and development organizations. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements 

20



with large and established companies. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of branded and generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
NMDAr-targeted therapies
A number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and specialty pharmaceutical companies are developing therapies targeting NMDArs. Most of the therapies being developed are broad antagonists and tend to have multiple target actions while our compounds are truly modulatory and have not demonstrated any off-target activity in preclinical screening. We are aware of other companies developing or commercializing NMDAr-targeted therapies, including but not limited to, Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc., Allergan (now a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc.), Avanir Pharmaceuticals Inc., Axsome Therapeutics Inc., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. Ltd., Cerecor Inc., C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Eli Lilly and Company, Genentech Inc., Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., NeuroRx Inc., Newron Pharmaceuticals S.p.A., Novartis International AG, Otonomy Inc., Relmada Therapeutics Inc., Sage Therapeutics Inc., UCB S.A., Gate Neurosciences Inc., and Vistagen Therapeutics Inc.
NYX-2925—neuropathic/chronic pain
We expect that, if approved, NYX-2925 will compete with the currently approved therapies for painful DPN and fibromyalgia, including pregabalin, duloxetine, and tapentadol HCl. We are aware of a number of therapies that are approved to treat other types of neuropathic pain. We are also aware that various therapies are used off-label to treat neuropathic pain. In addition to the marketed therapies, we are aware of companies currently developing therapies for neuropathic pain, including but not limited to AstraZeneca Plc., Bayer AG, Biogen Inc., Cara Therapeutics Inc., Daiichi Sankyo Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Eliem Therapeutics Inc., Helixmith Co. Ltd., Immune Pharmaceuticals Inc., Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Novaremed AG, Novartis AG, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, and WinSanTor Inc. 
NYX-783—post-traumatic stress disorder
We expect that, if approved, NYX-783 will compete with currently approved therapies for PTSD, including paroxetine and sertraline. We are also aware of other companies developing therapies for PTSD, including but not limited to Alto Neuroscience Inc., Atai Life Sciences AG, Bionomics Ltd., C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc., Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and Praxis Precision Medicines Inc.
NYX-458—Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment and dementia with Lewy bodies
We expect that, if approved, NYX-458 will compete with currently approved therapies for PDD, the only one of which in the United States is rivastigmine. We are also aware of other companies developing therapies for cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson’s disease and/or dementia with Lewy bodies, including but not limited to Athira Pharma Inc, Anavex Life Sciences, Annovis Bio Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Sage Therapeutics Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and Eisai Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Research collaboration agreement with Allergan 
The jointly funded research activities and option exercise period under our Research Collaboration Agreement, or RCA, with Allergan (now a subsidiary of AbbVie) came to their contractual conclusions in August 2020 and February 2021, respectively. Consistent with the terms of the RCA, AbbVie optioned two compounds from our NMDAr modulator discovery platform. 
Overview
In July 2015, we entered into an RCA with Allergan, pursuant to which we and Allergan have research, development, and commercial rights to compounds discovered using our discovery platform. The research collaboration was structured to afford Allergan an option to obtain field-limited rights for up to three of the compounds discovered under the research collaboration. In exchange for these rights, Allergan reimbursed us for a certain percentage of the direct costs associated 

21



with the medicinal chemistry, screening, and profiling efforts conducted as part of the research collaboration. Allergan also paid us a fixed annual rate per full time employee, or FTE, for each individual assigned to these discovery efforts. 
During the term of the RCA, Allergan could exercise up to three options to acquire full rights (including field-limited development and commercialization rights) for compounds from our discovery platform. Allergan research, development, and commercialization on optioned compounds is limited to a field of specified indications, including Alzheimer’s disease, delirium, and a list of psychiatric disorders (which list does not include PTSD or substance use disorder). By their terms, these field-related restrictions pertaining to Allergan’s license rights survive the expiration of the Agreement and the exclusivity period.  
Under this agreement, each time Allergan exercised an option, it was required to pay us an option exercise fee of $1.0 million and we were required to (a) assign to Allergan rights in intellectual property that pertains only to the Allergan-optioned compound if possible, and (b) grant Allergan a fully-paid, perpetual, exclusive (including with regard to Aptinyx) and irrevocable license under other intellectual property we control that pertains to both the optioned compound and also pertains to other compounds or uses, solely to develop and commercialize the optioned compound within Allergan’s field of specified indications. On May 16, 2018, Allergan exercised its option to acquire the compound designated AGN-241751, triggering payment of a $1.0 million option fee in connection with such exercise. On February 23, 2021, Allergan exercised its option to acquire the compound designated AGN-281705, triggering payment of a $1.0 million option fee in connection with such exercise. We will receive no further economic consideration from these product candidates. As the period of jointly funded research and option exercise period under this agreement have now reached their contractual conclusions, Allergan has no additional option exercise rights. 
We may research and develop any of our compounds as therapies for any indication outside of Allergan’s field of specified indications. We have invented, and therefore own, most intellectual property pertaining to compounds from our discovery platform, but Allergan must grant us a non-exclusive license under any intellectual property rights Allergan may own related to our compounds to develop and commercialize compounds outside of Allergan’s field of specified indications.
During the exclusivity period set forth in the agreement (which period expires on the third anniversary of the end of the RCA term), we have agreed not to, alone or with a third party, directly or indirectly, engage in the research, preclinical development, clinical development, or commercialization of any compound or any product for the purpose of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of any disorders or conditions in Allergan’s field of specified indications. In addition, any chemistry or technology we discover or develop related to the modulation of NMDArs for therapeutic effect is and will be subject to the terms of the agreement, including any exclusive license granted to Allergan in Allergan’s field of specified indications. Under the terms of the license granted under the RCA, for a period that extends beyond the expiration of the RCA term and the exclusivity period, Allergan and its affiliates will not have the right to, alone or with a third party, directly or indirectly, engage in the research, preclinical development, clinical development, or commercialization of the compounds it acquires under the research collaboration for the purpose of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of any disorders or conditions outside Allergan’s field of specified indications, without first obtaining our approval at our sole discretion. 
The term of the RCA expired on the expiration of Allergan’s option period on February 24, 2021, subject to the completion of all post-option transfer activities. 
This collaboration has enabled both parties to advance compounds from our discovery platform into clinical studies.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
As a key part of our product development approach, we aim to complete formulation work at an early stage of development, such that our clinical studies are conducted with a formulation that has the potential for eventual scale-up.

22



All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process, although certain manufacturers may choose to manufacture our product candidates in specifically isolated facilities since many are spiro-beta lactams. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Commercialization
We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, to commercialize our product candidates in the United States. We may work in combination with one or more large pharmaceutical partners for certain indications. Depending on the specific development path pursued, this may include larger chronic pain indications. For other, more specialized indications, we intend to commercialize our product candidates independently. For example, we believe the patient and prescriber populations for Parkinson’s disease cognitive impairment are relatively concentrated and can be addressed with a focused sales team of fewer than 200 full-time employees. We also do not believe any existing pharmaceutical companies have significant expertise in the commercialization of therapies in this specific area. We will, however, continuously review our partnering strategy in the light of new clinical data and market understanding. We may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions outside the United States.
Intellectual property 
Our owned patents and patent applications relate to our NMDAr modulating compounds and include patents and patent applications directed to new compositions of matter and to methods of treating brain and nervous system disorders. We intend to seek patent protection in the United States and in selected jurisdictions worldwide.
NYX-2925 and NYX-783 
As of February 15, 2022, we own two issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application, and pending and issued foreign counterpart patents and patent applications, that relate to both NYX-2925 and NYX-783. We also own one issued U.S. patent and two pending U.S. patent applications that relate to NYX-2925, and two issued U.S. patents, as well as one pending international patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), that relate to NYX-783. An international PCT patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a patent application in regional or national patent offices within 30 or 31 months of filing of the earliest-filed priority patent application. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2034. If we continue to pursue patent protection and file one or more patent applications with respect to our pending international PCT patent application, and if any patents issue based on our pending applications, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2041. 
NYX-458 
As of February 15, 2022, we own one issued U.S. patent, and three pending U.S. patent applications, and pending foreign counterpart patent applications, as well as one pending international patent application filed under the PCT that relate to our product candidate, NYX-458. An international PCT patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a patent application in regional or national patent offices within 30 or 31 months of filing of the earliest-filed priority patent application. The issued U.S. patent is expected to expire in 2037. If we continue to pursue patent protection and file one or more patent applications with respect to our pending international PCT patent application, and if any patents issue based on our pending applications, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire between 2037 and 2040. 
Other compounds 
As of February 15, 2022, we own fifteen issued U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, and pending and issued foreign counterpart patents and patent applications, as well as seven U.S. provisional patent applications, and one pending international patent application filed under the PCT, all of which generally relate to our efforts to develop other compounds in our NMDAr modulator small molecule program. Provisional patent applications are not eligible to 

23



become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing the provisional patent applications. An international PCT patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a patent application in regional or national patent offices within 30 or 31 months of filing of the earliest-filed priority patent application. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2034 and 2037. If we continue to pursue patent protection and file one or more non-provisional patent applications with respect to our pending provisional patent applications and file one or more patent applications with respect to our pending international PCT patent application, and if any patents issue based on our pending applications, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2041. For a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to our intellectual property rights.”
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. drug development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, a manufacturer may need to recall a product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical study site before each study may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical study-related regulations, referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and/or clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. These nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical studies may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical studies, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the study to be suspended or terminated. The FDA also may impose a partial clinical hold which places limits on a clinical study, such as limiting the dosing to a certain level or duration.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and completed clinical study results to public registries.
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, upon request, the FDA is to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools. A drug development tool includes a biomarker including a surrogate endpoint, a clinical outcome assessment including a patient-reported outcome, and any other method, material or measure that the FDA determines aids drug development and regulatory review. A drug 

25



development tool is qualified if the FDA has determined that the tool and its proposed context of use can be relied upon to have a specific interpretation and application in drug development and regulatory review. A qualified drug development tool may be used to support the investigational use of a drug or support or obtain NDA approval.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical study outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical study under an IND. If a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical study to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical study is conducted in compliance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary.
Clinical studies
Clinical studies are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies.

● | Phase 1 clinical studies generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical studies is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability, and safety of the drug.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical studies typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits and provide a preliminary evaluation of efficacy. At the same time, safety, and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical studies generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use and its safety in use, to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical studies may include comparisons with placebo and/or comparator treatments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical studies as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, a finding from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Additionally, a sponsor must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study.
Pursuant to the Cures Act, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or 

26



Phase 3 study of the investigational drug, or as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
Concurrently with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA and FDA review process
The results of the nonclinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is $3,117,218. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs ($369,413). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, for drugs that do not contain an NCE, the FDA has 10 months from the receipt date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the receipt date for a priority NDA. For drugs containing an NCE, these ten- and six-month review timeframes are from the filing date of an NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical studies to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical study data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during 

27



the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical studies and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug’s safety and efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA also may place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our 

28



product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under the Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinical development. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric trials
The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical studies and/or other clinical development programs.
Post-marketing requirements
Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the FDA of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, applicable product tracking and tracing requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for 

29



promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical studies. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States.
In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Changes in statutes, regulations, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Orange Book listing
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. Limited changes must be preapproved by the FDA via a suitability petition. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include nonclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product 

30



is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents having claims that cover the applicant’s product and method of use. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the date on which the patent will expire and approval will not be sought until after the patent expiration; or (4) the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the competitor has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner within 20 days after the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay.
In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owners regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
U.S. marketing exclusivity
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. The FDCA also provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains 

31



a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. While we believe there is a likelihood that the FDA would grant NCE status to both NYX-2925 and NYX-783 if both are granted regulatory approval, NYX-2925 and NYX-783 have the same structural formula but differ in spatial orientation, i.e., are separate stereoisomers of each other, and there can be no assurance that both will be granted NCE exclusivity. Three-year and five-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
U.S. patent-term extension
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our current product candidates or any future product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Act. The Hatch Waxman Act permits extension of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term extension period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension (and only those patent claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended), and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension. In the future, we may apply for extension of patent term for our currently owned patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, there can be no assurance that the USPTO will grant us any requested patent term extension, either for the length we request or at all.
Other regulatory matters 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion, and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services including the Office of the Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local regulatory authorities. In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include:

● | the federal Anti Kickback Statute, or AKS, prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, arrangement or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the AKS without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

32




● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, transmit or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | the federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act,” under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to physician (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) payments and other transfers of value and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests, including such interests held by their immediate family. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;

​

● | federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing. Data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018). State laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.

​
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new 

33



technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
​
Other regulations may affect other aspects of our business. For example, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
European Union drug development
In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Clinical Trials Regulation offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Directive and the new Clinical Trials Regulation if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the new Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the previous Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Directive until three years after the new Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable, the new Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation overhauls the current system of approvals for clinical studies in the EU. Specifically, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. The main characteristics of the Clinical Trials Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
European Union drug review and approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is 

34



valid throughout the entire territory of the EU and the additional Member States of the European Ecominc Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as products produced by biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in another Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
European Union new chemical data and market entity exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products, sometimes referred to as new active substances, approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar 

35



product can be marketed in the EU until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
In the EU, the European Commission, based on the recommendation of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that are: (1) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affectsnot more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development); and (3)there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, if such a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval, during which the EMA cannot grant an MA for a similar medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period is extended by two years for compliance with an agreed upon pediatric investigation plan granted at the time of review of the orphan designation. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year it is determined that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time, if (i) the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application, (ii) the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply sufficient quantities of the orphan medicinal product, or (iii) the second applicant can establish that the second medicinal product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized orphan medicinal product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
European data collection
The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or processing of personal data, including personal health data, in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018 and related applicable data protection and privacy laws of the Member States of the EEA. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including imposing special requirements in respect of the processing of health and other sensitive data (such as higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, and other measures to take when engaging third-party processors). EEA Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including health and medical information), or could cause our compliance costs to increase. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA 

36



to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S.On June 4, 2021, the European Commission issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC’s new standard contractual clauses but has published a draft version of a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which, once finalized, will enable transfers from the UK. Following a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union, in Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems (‘Schrems II’), Case C-311/18 (“Schrems II”), companies relying on standard contractual clauses to govern transfers of personal data to third countries (in particular the United States) will need to assess whether the data importer can ensure sufficient guarantees for safeguarding the personal data under GDPR. This assessment includes assessing whether third party vendors can also ensure these guarantees. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost.
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. The authorities have shown a willingness to impose significant fines and issue orders preventing the processing of personal data on non-compliant businesses. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR and other European data protection laws. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR or other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to change our use of data, enforcement notices, or potential civil claims including class action type litigation. Given the breadth and depth of data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR will require significant time, resources and expense, and we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under the GDPR will be sufficient. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Further to the United Kingdom’s (UK) exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the ”UK GDPR”). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.

Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and the UK officially withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented European Union legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the UK has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now that has come into effect is not yet known, however the MHRA has conducted a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation.
Rest of the world regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. While the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor by payor basis. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved or that any required patient cost-sharing amount will be acceptable to the patient. Moreover, one payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is: 

● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------

38




● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
Third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician usage of the products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.

39



For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:

● | made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

40



Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administrations or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business. 
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:

● | On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
Human Capital Resources
As of March 15, 2022, we employed 40 full-time employees, including 25 in research and development and 15 in general and administrative, and no part-time employees. Nine of our employees hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

42



Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. Our success depends on our ability to attract, engage, and retain a diverse group of employees. We value our employees and regularly benchmark total rewards we provide, such as short and long term compensation, including stock-based compensation awards and payments of cash-based performance bonus awards, 401(k) contributions, health, welfare and quality of life benefits, paid time off and personal leave, against our industry peers to ensure we remain competitive and attractive to potential new hires. We also conduct employee engagement surveys to evaluate our success with respect to our human capital objectives and to allow us to retain and incentivize our existing employees. By focusing on employee retention and engagement, we improve our ability to support our clinical trials, our pipeline, and our business and operations, and also protect the long-term interests of our securityholders.
