In fiscal year 2017, Chamberlain received approval to launch an online Master of Public Health (“MPH”) degree program through its College of Health Professions. MPH classes started in July 2017.
 
Eleven of Chamberlain’s 20 campuses are co-located with DeVry University. Chamberlain had 26,811 students enrolled in the July 2017 term, an increase of 6.3% over the prior year.
 
Chamberlain provides an education experience distinguished by a high level of care for students, academic excellence, innovation and integrity. Chamberlain is committed to graduating health professionals who are empowered to transform healthcare worldwide.
 
Chamberlain College of Nursing’s degree programs span the professional nursing spectrum, from the baccalaureate entry into nursing practice to the terminal practice doctorate. The baccalaureate program integrates theoretical knowledge of general education and nursing content, psychomotor skills development, and development of clinical judgment/reasoning to help students develop the education and skills necessary for a lifetime of personal and professional growth. Pre-licensure students apply theoretical knowledge through robust, hands-on instruction using sophisticated simulators and simulation scenarios along with clinical training at hospitals or other healthcare facilities. Post-licensure students develop advanced nursing practice knowledge and skills through classroom, simulation, project development and practicum experiences in a variety of healthcare settings. Chamberlain has developed numerous partnerships with hospitals and other healthcare facilities to insure that educational objectives can be met for its programs.
 
Chamberlain’s pre-licensure BSN degree is an onsite baccalaureate program. The BSN program enables students to complete their BSN degree in three years of full-time study as opposed to the typical four-year BSN program with summer breaks During calendar year 2016, Chamberlain pre-licensure BSN students who completed the National Council Licensure Examination (“NCLEX”) had an overall pass rate of 80%, which was eight percentage points lower than the national BSN average pass rate. NCLEX pass rates have been increasing each quarter since the third quarter of calendar 2016.
 
Students who already have achieved RN designation through a diploma or associate degree can complete their BSN degree online through Chamberlain’s RN to BSN completion program in three semesters of full-time study, although most students enroll part-time while they continue working as nurses.
 
The online MSN degree program offers four non direct-care specialty tracks: Educator, Executive, Informatics and Healthcare Policy. These programs require 36 credit hours and are designed to be completed in approximately two years of part-time study. Chamberlain also offers a direct-care Family Nurse Practitioner (“FNP”) track. This program requires 45 credit hours along with 625 lab and clinical hours and is designed to be completed in 2-1/2 years of part-time study.
 
The online DNP degree program is based on the eight essentials of doctoral education outlined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”). The DNP program is designed for nurses seeking a terminal degree in nursing and offers an alternative to research-focused PhD programs. The Chamberlain DNP program offers a Healthcare Systems Leadership track. The program requires 30 to 40 credit hours along with 500 to 1,000 clinical practicum hours. The programs can be completed in five to six semesters of study.
 
Chamberlain College of Health Profession’s degree programs focus on preparing healthcare professionals to contribute to the health of individuals and populations by promoting healthy communities and preventing community health problems. The coursework is interdisciplinary and draws on systems thinking knowledge and skills from a variety of disciplines. The programs prepare graduates to become leadership change agents to improve health outcomes at the community level.
 
Chamberlain’s MPH degree is designed to prepare students (nurses and non-nurses) to become public health practitioners to work with communities and populations globally to promote healthy communities, and to prevent community health problems such as disease, poverty, health access disparities and violence through interdisciplinary coursework.

Medical and Veterinary Schools operates three institutions:
 
· | American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (“AUC”) confers the Doctor of Medicine (“M.D.”) degree;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ross University School of Medicine (“RUSM”) confers the M.D. degree; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (“RUSVM”) confers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (“D.V.M.”) degree. Through its Postgraduate Studies Program, RUSVM also offers Master of Science (MSc) and Doctoral (PhD) degrees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Together, the three schools along with the Medical Education Readiness Program (“MERP”) and the Veterinary Preparation Program (“Vet Prep”) had 5,491 students enrolled in the May 2017 semester, a 6.1% decrease from the prior year.
 
AUC was founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in August 2011. AUC is located in the country of St. Maarten and has graduated over 6,000 physicians now licensed and practicing medicine throughout the world. The mission of AUC is to provide an excellent medical education to qualified students of diverse backgrounds. This is to be accomplished within an atmosphere of academic integrity and scholarship, which fosters the highest standards in professional ethics and competence.
RUSM, which was founded in 1978, and acquired by Adtalem in May 2003, is one of the world’s largest providers of medical education. RUSM is located in the country of Dominica with the Internal Medicine Foundation program residing in Miramar, Florida. RUSM has graduated more than 13,000 physicians who practice medicine in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. The mission of RUSM is to prepare highly dedicated students to become effective, successful physicians. RUSM accomplishes this by focusing on imparting the knowledge, skills and values required for its students to establish a successful and satisfying career as a physician.
 
AUC’s and RUSM’s respective medical education programs are comparable to the educational programs offered at U.S. medical schools. AUC’s and RUSM’s programs consist of three academic semesters per year — beginning in January, May and September — which allows students to complete their basic science instruction in less time than they would at a U.S. medical school. The programs provide a generalist medical education and the foundation for post graduate specialty training, which is primarily completed in the U.S.
 
Initially, AUC and RUSM students complete a program of concentrated study of medical sciences in modern classrooms and laboratories at campuses located in St. Maarten and Dominica, respectively. After students sit for Step 1 of the U.S. Medical Licensing Examinationtm (“USMLE”), which assesses whether medical school students understand and can apply scientific concepts that are basic to the practice of medicine, they complete the remainder of their program by participating in clinical rotations under AUC and RUSM direction, and conducted at approximately 50 affiliated teaching hospitals or medical centers affiliated with accredited medical education programs in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.
 
MERP assists prospective AUC and RUSM students in building the academic foundation they need to be successful in medical school and to achieve their goals of becoming physicians.
 
RUSVM, which was founded in 1982 and acquired by Adtalem in May 2003, is one of the largest providers of veterinary education. RUSVM is located in the country of St. Kitts and has graduated more than 4,000 veterinarians who practice principally in the U.S. The mission of RUSVM is to provide the best learning environment to prepare students to become members and leaders of the worldwide public and professional healthcare team, advancing human and animal health (One Health) through research and knowledge exchange.
 
The RUSVM program is structured to provide a veterinary education that is comparable to educational programs at U.S. veterinary schools. RUSVM students complete a seven-semester pre-clinical curriculum at a campus in St. Kitts. After completing their pre-clinical curriculum, RUSVM students enter a clinical clerkship lasting approximately 45 weeks under RUSVM direction at one of more than 20 affiliated U.S. Colleges of Veterinary Medicine as well as international affiliates in Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.
 
The RUSVM Vet Prep Program is designed to enhance the preclinical science knowledge and study skills that are critical to success in veterinary school. It is structured to prepare students for success at RUSVM.

Professional Education
 
Becker Professional Education (“Becker”), founded in 1957 as Becker CPA Review and acquired by Adtalem in 1996, is a global leader in professional education serving the accounting, finance, project management and healthcare professions. Becker prepares candidates for the Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”), Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (“ACCA”), Certified Management Accountant (“CMA”), Project Management Professional (“PMP”), and USMLE certification examinations and offers continuing professional education programs and seminars. Classes are taught in approximately 300 locations, including sites in approximately 55 foreign countries and DeVry University teaching sites; classes are taught directly by Becker and through licensed affiliates. Nearly one million candidates have prepared for the Uniform CPA Examination (“CPA exam”) using Becker’s CPA Exam Review Course.
 
The CPA exam is prepared and administered by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”). The CPA exam is only offered in a computer-based, on-demand, four-part format for eight months of the year. In addition to successfully passing the four-part exam, CPA candidates must also meet educational, work experience, and other requirements specific to the state or jurisdiction in which they intend to be licensed to practice.
 
Through its CPA exam review courses, Becker served over 40,000 students in fiscal year 2017. Becker is the industry leader in providing CPA exam review services and has been preparing candidates to pass the CPA exam for over 50 years. For calendar year 2016, 51 of the 57 Elijah Watt Sells Award winners, individuals who achieved the highest cumulative scores on the CPA exam, prepared with Becker. Since 2005, when the AICPA began to share national results, 90 percent or more of the exam’s top scorers have prepared with Becker.
 
To better meet the demands of today’s busy professionals, Becker’s classes are offered in two formats: live and self-study. The self-study product is interactive, and offers the same instructor-led lectures and materials available in the live classroom courses. Becker provides access to online academic support with highly targeted answers to specific questions.
 
Based on surveys of Becker CPA Exam Review students who took the CPA exam, and published exam pass rate statistics supplied by the AICPA, Becker CPA Exam Review students pass at twice the rate of all CPA exam candidates who did not take a Becker Exam Review Course.
 
Becker also offers continuing professional education and training programs in the fields of accounting, finance and project management to help individuals and organizations achieve superior performance through professional development. In addition, Becker Healthcare provides comprehensive review programs for today’s physicians in training.
 
In July 2016, Becker acquired the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (“ACAMS”), which was founded in 2001 and is headquartered in Miami, Florida. ACAMS has operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The acquisition further expands Becker’s professional education offerings into anti-money laundering (“AML”) and financial crimes prevention training, conferences, and certification. ACAMS is the largest international membership organization dedicated to enhancing the knowledge, skills and expertise of anti-money laundering and financial crime detection and prevention professionals. ACAMS has approximately 53,000 members in 175 countries. Our members include representatives from a wide range of financial institutions, regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies and industry sectors.

MARKET TRENDS AND COMPETITION
 
Medical and Healthcare
 
Chamberlain University
 
Chamberlain competes in the U.S. nursing education market, which has more than 1,800 programs leading to RN licensure. These include four-year educational institutions, two-year community colleges, and diploma schools of nursing. The market consists of two distinct segments: pre-licensure nursing programs that prepare students to take the NCLEX-RN licensure exam and post-licensure nursing programs that allow existing RNs to advance their education. Nursing constitutes the largest occupation in healthcare in the U.S., with 2.8 million RNs in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that employment of RNs is expected to grow 16% from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average employment growth rate for all occupations.
 
In the pre-licensure nursing market, enrollment caps and limited new student enrollment periods are common among traditional four-year education institutions and community colleges. Despite the long-term need for nurses, institutions are not increasing educational capacity to keep up with demand. According to AACN’s report on 2016-2017 Enrollment and Graduations in Baccalaureate and Graduate Programs in Nursing, U.S. nursing schools turned away 64,067 qualified applicants from baccalaureate nursing programs in 2016 due to budget constraints and an insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space and clinical preceptors. In addition, demand for BSN degrees is impacted by the Institute of Medicine recommendation and the American Nurses Credentialing Center Magnet designation criteria that require hospitals to employ or have a plan to employ at least 80% BSN nurses.
 
Chamberlain management believes it has many advantages over its competition including:
 
· | Chamberlain Care culture that reinforces a commitment to student success;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offering a three-year, year-round BSN program as opposed to typical four-year BSN programs where students take the summer off;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | High tech simulation labs that allow students to master techniques prior to entering the clinical environment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Diverse student body reflecting the communities in which they live.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In post-licensure nursing education, there are over 600 institutions offering RN to BSN programs and over 500 institutions offering master’s degrees in nursing.
 
Chamberlain has an advantage in the post-licensure market over many of its competitors because it offers:
 
· | Eight-week sessions, with six start dates per year;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | With the exception of the MSN FNP immersion weekend, there are no onsite coursework requirements, providing the flexibility necessary for working healthcare professionals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No GRE required for graduate program admissions;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Curricula focused on preparing competent professionals in the shortest time possible;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rigorous faculty orientation and training programs resulting in caring and responsive faculty;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RN to BSN Option has received two Quality Matters Certifications for Online Learner Support and Online Teaching Support;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--


· | All post-licensure students have access to Student Success Strategies, which is an on-demand learning resource designed to support adult online learners; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Chamberlain’s RN to BSN Option and MSN degree programs are approved in all 50 states and its FNP Specialty Track is approved in 44 states.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As of August 10, 2017, Chamberlain is approved to offer its MPH program in 39 states.

Medical and Veterinary Schools
 
AUC and RUSM compete with 145 accredited U.S. schools of medicine, 33 U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine and approximately 40 Caribbean medical schools as well as with international medical schools recruiting U.S. students who may be eligible to receive funding from U.S. Department of Education (“ED”) Title IV programs. RUSVM competes with American Veterinary Medical Association (“AVMA”) accredited schools, of which 30 are U.S.-based, 5 are Canadian and 13 are other international veterinary schools.
 
The medical and veterinary schools educational institutions attract potential students for several reasons. Some applied to U.S.-based medical or veterinary schools but were not admitted or were wait-listed. Some students elected not to apply to U.S. schools because of self-perceived chances of gaining acceptance. For some students, the medical and veterinary schools education institutions are their first or only choice of schools because of their commitment to and focus on quality and on practitioner-oriented teaching.
 
For the 2016-2017 academic year, the Association of American Medical Colleges (“AAMC”) reported 53,042 U.S. medical school applicants, a 0.9% increase over the prior year. Of these applicants, 21,030 enrolled, a 1.9% increase over the prior year.
 
For the 2016-2017 academic year, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (“AACOMAS”) reported 20,720 applicants to U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, a 1.3% increase over the prior year. The number of Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation approved seats of 6,592 increased 3.1% over the prior year.
 
For the 2016-2017 academic year, the Association of American Veterinary Medicine Colleges (“AAVMC”) received 7,076 applicants, a 6.1% increase over the prior year, for the 4,120 seats available at AAVMC institutional members (U.S. and international). The number of available seats increased 2% over the prior year.
 
Medical and veterinary school applicants who were denied admission or wait-listed at U.S. schools constitute a large segment of prospective students for the Adtalem medical and veterinary schools.
 
According to the AAMC Center for Workforce Studies, in a February 2017 analysis, projected physician demand will continue to grow faster than supply, leading to a projected total physician shortfall of between 40,800 and 104,900 physicians by 2030. The shortfall ranges from 34,600 to 82,600 physicians in 2025, and it is projected to increase significantly by 2030.
 
There has been some recent expansion in the U.S. medical education and veterinary education enrollment capacities because of the growing supply/demand imbalance for medical doctors. Despite this expansion, management believes the imbalance will continue to spur demand for medical education.

Some Becker students enroll after taking other review courses or studying independently without success.
 
Extending the marketing and administrative benefits of operating within Adtalem, Becker offers classes at DeVry University locations or through online learning in conjunction with DeVry University’s Keller School of Management MBA, Master of Accounting and Financial Management or Master of Science in Accounting programs. CPA exam candidates can take advantage of Becker’s CPA Exam Review learning approach and materials earning full academic credit. These credits also may be used to fulfill the 150-hour educational requirement that most states have made a prerequisite to becoming licensed as a CPA.
 
ACAMS
 
Money laundering and the financing of terrorism are financial crimes with significant economic effects. The United Nations Office on Drug and Crime estimates that in one year 2-5% of global GDP, or $800 billion - $2 trillion, is laundered globally. Money laundering can occur in various forms including corruption, drug trafficking, tax evasion and cybercrime. AML is the set of procedures, laws and regulations designed to combat the practice of generating income through illegal actions. Professionals who need effective AML procedures include financial institutions, insurers, asset managers, lawyers, broker-dealers, private equity firms, consultants, law enforcement and credit institutions. This training protects companies against various costs such as financial penalties from regulatory bodies, personal liability, financial action from shareholders or employees and reputational damage.
 
There are approximately 1.6 million AML industry individuals that can be addressed in the various market segments. Organizations training methods are met by third-party training, internally developed training or informal training. Regulators are pressuring companies to develop higher standards and to maintain these standards. Due to regulations changing frequently, internal training is losing credibility and causing regulators to place higher weight on the third-party developed training programs. Currently, 30% of training is reported to be outsourced to third parties. ACAMS is the largest AML certifier and is considered the “gold standard” in AML credentialing.

Adtalem Brazil
 
The Brazilian private postsecondary education market grew by 47% between 2005 and 2015 (onsite students), reaching approximately $17 billion in revenue and enrollment of 6.1 million students in 2015, according to Hoper Educational Consulting and the Ministry of Education (“MEC”). In addition, the goals defined by the Nacional Plan of Education (“NPE”) for the period from 2011 to 2023, indicate a continuing favorable scenario for the expansion of higher education in Brazil. NPE expects to increase enrollments by 50%, which would represent almost five million more higher education students in the next seven to eight years.
 
Brazil has the largest private higher education market in Latin America, which until recently, was highly fragmented. Within the last several years, private equity firms and international educational groups have been investing in the country’s education institutions resulting in consolidation of the market. Private higher education institutions can be divided into three different segments:
 

· | Mass market: fastest growing segment, with the highest regulatory risk;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Superior quality market: growth is driven by gaining market share from competitors; increasing the accessibility of student financing should accelerate growth in this market; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Niche market: highly specialized, has limited growth potential.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Most Adtalem Brazil institutions compete in the superior quality market. Adtalem Brazil faces local competition at each location in which it operates. Nationwide there are also competitors such as: Laureate, Kroton Educacional, Anima, SER and UNIP.
 
Private institutions play an important role in the Brazilian education market. According to MEC, of the 8.0 million students who were enrolled in higher education in Brazil, 76% were enrolled in private institutions. Enrollment of new students in private institutions grew by 4.5% from 2012 to 2014, compared to 1.9% growth of new students at public institutions.
 
According to the Brazilian Association of Distance Learning Education, the number of jobs requiring successful completion of a competency exam grew by 45% from 2013 to 2015. There are currently approximately 12 million applicants for these positions. The number of Order of Attorneys of Brazil Exam (the equivalent of the U.S. Bar Exam) applicants has been steady at approximately 115,000 for the past two years.
 
U.S. Traditional Postsecondary
 
DeVry University
 
In every market in which DeVry University operates, there are numerous state institutions, community colleges and independent universities. In particular, there continues to be competitive pressure from online programs by private-sector, publicly-funded and independent institutions. Due to increased competition and the overall postsecondary student population decline over the last several years, DeVry University is experiencing significantly higher declines in enrollment.
 
While tuition at independent institutions is, on average, higher than tuition at DeVry University, the net price (Cost of Attendance less scholarships and grants) for the demographic served by DeVry University is often less. Publicly-supported colleges often offer similar programs at a lower tuition level because of government subsidies, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial sources not available to private-sector schools. Many local community colleges offer programs similar in content to DeVry University’s associate degree programs, but at a much lower tuition. While community colleges may be viewed as competitors, they also provide DeVry University an opportunity. DeVry University has a number of articulation and transfer agreements in place with community colleges that make it easier for community college graduates to continue their education to earn a bachelor’s degree at DeVry University.

Carrington College
 
The career college segment of the postsecondary education market is highly fragmented and competitive. No single institution has a significant market share. Most students will not relocate or travel long distances to attend a career college, so competition is primarily at the local level. Competitors range from large public community colleges to professionally operated multi-campus institutions to single campus family owned institutions. In general, community colleges offer the lowest tuition prices and have the largest enrollments.

Student Admissions and Admissions Standards
 
DeVry University employs admission representatives who assist with applicants interested in attending the university.
 
Many of DeVry University’s applicants are working adults who want to attend class in the evening or on weekends, recently unemployed adults seeking to improve their job skills, and students transferring to a DeVry University undergraduate program from other colleges and universities. Because a large portion of our new undergraduate students have some prior college experience, DeVry University has articulation agreements with many community colleges to facilitate the enrollment of their students seeking to transfer course credits to DeVry University.
 
To be admitted to a DeVry University undergraduate program, a U.S. applicant must be a high school graduate from a DeVry University recognized institution, have a GED certificate, or hold a degree from a DeVry University approved postsecondary institution. Applicants for general admission must be at least 17 years old and complete an interview with an admissions advisor. International applicants must provide documentation demonstrating the required level of prior education, satisfy the English-language proficiency requirement and meet all other admission requirements.
 
All applicants must meet prescribed admission qualifications and be evaluated by DeVry University to determine admissibility and placement. Admissibility and placement criteria vary by degree program. During the admission process, applicants are required to take the DeVry University administered placement exams, which assess achievement levels and transitional study needs. ACT or SAT scores deemed appropriate for the desired program, or acceptable grades in qualifying college-level work completed at an approved postsecondary institution, may also be used to evidence admissibility and determine placement.
 
To be admitted to a graduate program, applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree from a U.S. institution that is accredited by a U.S. regional accrediting agency or selected national accrediting agencies or international institutions recognized as the equivalent, and complete an interview with an admissions representative. International applicants must hold a degree recognized as equivalent to a U.S. baccalaureate degree, satisfy the English-language proficiency requirement and meet all other admission requirements. Applicants whose undergraduate cumulative grade point average is 2.50 or higher are eligible for admission. Applicants with a cumulative grade point average below 2.50 must achieve acceptable scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (“GMAT”), the Graduate Record Examination (“GRE”) or the DeVry University administered placement exams. Admissions decisions are based on evaluation of a candidate’s academic credentials, entrance test scores and a personal interview.

ACCREDITATION
 
Educational institutions and their individual programs are awarded accreditation by achieving a level of quality that entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public they serve. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to ensure continued high performance, institutional and program improvement and integrity, and to confirm that accreditation requirements continue to be satisfied. College and university administrators depend on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating transfer credit and applicants to their schools; employers rely on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating a candidate’s credentials; and parents and high school counselors look to accreditation for assurance that an institution meets quality educational standards. Moreover, in the U.S., accreditation is necessary for students to qualify for federal financial assistance, and most scholarship commissions restrict their awards to students attending accredited institutions.

Adtalem Brazil
 
The Brazilian MEC controls and regulates postsecondary education at all levels in Brazil. The MEC also controls the issuance of licenses and permits.
 
The MEC licensing process occurs on two levels: institutional and programmatic. Each institution is required to obtain a license, which must be renewed every three to five years. An Indice Geral de Cursos (IGC) or “General Programs Index” score above 2, within a range of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the maximum grade possible) is considered satisfactory. The current ICG score of all Adtalem Brazil institutions, except Joao Pessoa and Sao Luis, is 3 or greater. Joao Pessoa and Sao Luis have not yet received a score.
 
The IGC score is calculated using the average of all the “Conceito Preliminar de Curso” or “Preliminary Program Grade” (“CPC”) of the institution, weighted by the number of students. The CPC is an academic quality metric composed of:
 
55%       Results of the ENADE - the national end-of-program exam organized by MEC;
 30%       Faculty credentials and part or full-time faculty status; and
 15%       Student satisfaction.
 

19
--

 

MEC also licenses programs at each institution. The regulations are different for undergraduate and graduate programs. For undergraduate programs, MEC must grant “authorization” status before classes may commence. After a program is 50% to 75% complete, MEC auditors visit the program to grant the definitive license, which can be automatically renewed every three years, unless the program presents an unsatisfactory CPC below 3 within a range of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the maximum grade). Currently, Adtalem Brazil has approximately 380 authorized undergraduate programs; 192 of them have been licensed and the remainder have not yet reached 75% of completion.
 
Programs leading to Master of Science and Doctorate degrees are strictly regulated at the graduate level in Brazil by MEC. Other types of graduate programs are loosely regulated and do not have licenses issued by MEC. Adtalem Brazil has one Master of Science program at FBV and two at IBMEC RJ. All three had their licenses renewed in 2015.
 
U.S. Traditional Postsecondary
 
DeVry University

DeVry University is accredited by the HLC. In September 2008, DeVry University was accepted into the Academic Quality Improvement Program (“AQIP”) of the HLC, a seven-year accreditation reaffirmation process based on creating a culture of continuous improvement, one of DeVry University’s key values. In 2013, the HLC conducted a comprehensive evaluation of DeVry University through the AQIP process and granted reaffirmation of accreditation. The next comprehensive evaluation is scheduled for 2019-2020 (subject to changes in HLC requirements).
 
In addition to regional accreditation for the overall university, several of DeVry University’s programs hold programmatic accreditation. The baccalaureate electronics engineering technology, biomedical engineering technology and computer engineering technology programs at many of DeVry University’s U.S. locations are accredited by the Electronics Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ETAC of ABET), an accreditation board for applied science, computing, engineering and technical education. DeVry University recently received reaffirmation of accreditation from ETAC of ABET for all of these programs until 2023. Additionally, for the first time the online ET programs are now also accredited by ABET, which has only been granted to a very limited number of universities.
 
The associate degree program in health information technology and the Medical Billing and Coding certificate are offered online. These programs, and the bachelor’s degree program in technical management with health information management specialty, are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (“CAHIIM”).
 
The clinical laboratory science program at DeVry University’s Phoenix, Arizona campus is accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (“NAACLS”). This program is no longer accepting new applicants and students enrolled are being taught out through their graduation date.
 
The Project Management Institute’s Global Accreditation Center accredits DeVry University’s baccalaureate business administration and technical management programs when completed with a project management emphasis.
 
DeVry University undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business and accounting were granted initial accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Business Programs and Schools (“ACBSP”) in May 2013. DeVry University became only the ninth institution to achieve separate accounting accreditation from the ACBSP at the time of initial accreditation. This is an important milestone in recognition of DeVry University’s quality programs and its commitment to continuous improvement.

Technology and Business
 
Adtalem Brazil
 
Adtalem Brazil operates 23 academic sites in 12 states in Northeast, North and Southeast Brazil. Adtalem Brazil also operates approximately 220 distance learnings centers throughout Brazil under Damasio’s franchise agreements. Each of these cities has different competitive markets and therefore we offer localized tuition rates.
 
All Adtalem Brazil institutions have tuition levels that are competitive with other top ranked institutions in their local markets. Due to the nature and wide range of programs, tuition varies from approximately $242 per month for an Associate Degree up to approximately $2,080 per month for a Medical Degree. Damasio provides test preparation, undergraduate and graduate courses, which vary in price from approximately $74 for a test preparation course up to approximately $938 for an undergraduate course. This pricing structure is consistent with Adtalem Brazil’s positioning as a quality education provider offering a high level of service to its students.
 
U.S. Traditional Postsecondary
 
DeVry University
 
DeVry University’s Fixed Tuition Promise (“FTP”) is a cohort tuition policy for matriculating students enrolled in the July 2014 through May 2017 sessions, whereby tuition rates are locked in until students graduate as long as they remain enrolled. To maintain eligibility, students may not miss more than five consecutive sessions. The FTP applies to students in all programs and all levels of study. The FTP was eliminated effective with the May 2017 session.
 
Since September 2015, DeVry University’s U.S. undergraduate tuition has been $609 per credit hour for new students. If a student was enrolled before September 2015, they will continue to pay $609 per credit hour for up to seven credit hours and $365 for each credit hour in excess of seven credit hours as they are covered under the FTP; however, this special savings is no longer available for students who first enrolled after September 2015. For students who apply after April 21, 2017 and enroll in the July 2017 session and forward to one of DeVry University’s Tech Path associate or bachelor’s degree programs, tuition has been reduced to $487 per credit hour. These amounts do not include the cost of books, supplies, fees, transportation and living expenses. Based upon current tuition rates, a full-time, newly enrolled student in the five semester undergraduate network systems administration associate degree program will pay total tuition of $32,629. A newly enrolled student in the eight semester undergraduate computer information systems bachelor’s degree program will pay total tuition of $60,388. Each semester is comprised of two eight-week sessions.
 
Effective July 2017, Keller program tuition per course is $2,298. This rate is unchanged from the prior year.
 
The DeVry University Scholarship and Grant program is a merit-based award designed to give qualified students an opportunity to be rewarded for their academic performance as they progress in their studies to graduation. Initial awards are based on a student’s incoming grade point average, with subsequent awards determined annually based on the student’s cumulative grade point average. Eligible students can receive up to $25,000 in lifetime award funding for bachelor’s degree students, and up to a $12,500 lifetime award for associate degree students. Award amounts range from $1,000 to $2,500 per semester for full-time enrollment. This program was eliminated for new students enrolling in the July 2017 session and forward. Current recipients in this program will continue to receive their scholarships as long as they maintain their eligibility.
 
If a student leaves school before completing an enrollment period, U.S. state and Canadian provincial regulations permit schools to retain a set percentage of the total tuition received. This amount varies, but generally equals or exceeds the percentage of the term the student completes. Excess amounts are refunded to the student or the appropriate financial aid funding source.

Carrington College 
 
On a per credit hour basis, tuition for Carrington programs range from $306 per credit hour to $1,684 per credit hour, with the wide range due to the nature of the programs. General education courses are charged at $335 to $371 per credit hour. Students are charged a non-refundable registration fee of $100, and they are also charged separately for books, uniforms, program-specific supplies and/or testing. A student services fee ranging from $30 to $50, depending on the course, is charged as well. Total program tuition ranges from approximately $13,000 to $20,000 for most certificate programs and up to approximately $62,000 for a few advanced programs.
FINANCIAL AID AND FINANCING STUDENT EDUCATION
 
Students attending Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Adtalem Brazil, DeVry University and Carrington pay for their education through a variety of sources. These sources include government-sponsored financial aid, private and university-provided scholarships, employer-provided tuition assistance, veteran’s benefits, private loans and cash payments. Students attending Becker review courses and ACAMS programs are not eligible for federal or state financial aid, but many receive partial or full tuition or fee reimbursement from their employers. In addition, Becker’s CPA Review Course can be financed through Becker under an 18-month term loan program.
 
The following table summarizes Adtalem’s cash receipts from tuition payments by fund source as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Final data for fiscal year 2017 is not yet available.
 

 | Fiscal Year | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+----
 | 2016 | | | 2015
Funding Source: | | | | | | 
Federal Assistance (Title IV) Program Funding (Grants and Loans) | | 58 | % | | 59 | %

Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
All financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, “HEA”) guides the federal government’s support of postsecondary education. The HEA was last reauthorized by the U.S. Congress in July 2008, and was signed into law in August 2008. Committee leadership of both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have begun HEA reauthorization activities with hearings and introduction of several related bills. Existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change in this process. Among the issues that management believes may be included in the final reauthorization bill are affordability and college costs; access, persistence and completion; more transparent information for consumers; student loan programs; accreditation and oversight; innovation; and the administrative burden of federal regulations. Additionally, funding for student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions.
 
Information about Particular U.S. Government Financial Aid Programs
 
Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students participate in many U.S. and Canadian financial aid programs. Each of these programs is briefly described below.
United States Federal Financial Aid Programs
 
Students in the U.S. rely on three types of ED student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA.
 
1. Grants. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington undergraduate students may participate in the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant programs.
 

· | Federal Pell Grants: These funds do not have to be repaid and are available to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and who have not already received a baccalaureate degree. For the 2017-2018 school year, eligible students could receive Federal Pell Grants ranging from $900 to $8,800.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


23
--


· | Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”): This is a supplement to the Federal Pell Grant, and is only available to the neediest undergraduate students. Federal rules restrict the amount of FSEOG funds that may go to a single institution. The maximum individual FSEOG award is established by the institution but cannot exceed $4,000 per academic year. Educational institutions are required to supplement federal funds with a 25% matching contribution. Institutional matching contributions may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by state grants, scholarship funds (discussed below) or by externally provided scholarship grants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Loans. Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students may participate in the Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized and PLUS programs within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. DeVry University students may also participate in the Federal Perkins Student Loan Program.

· | Direct Subsidized Loan: Awarded on the basis of student financial need, it is a low-interest loan (a portion of the interest is subsidized by the Federal government) available to undergraduate students with interest charges and principal repayment deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis (the student is responsible for paying the interest charges during the six months after no longer attending school on at least a half-time basis for those loans with a first disbursement between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2014). First time borrowers after July 1, 2013 are eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans only for 150% of the published length of their academic program. Loan limits per academic year range from $3,500 for students in their first academic year to $5,500 for students in their third or higher undergraduate academic year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Awarded to students who do not meet the needs test or as an additional supplement to the Direct Subsidized Loan. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Unsubsidized Loan limits per academic year range from $6,000 for students in their first and second academic year to $7,000 in later years and increasing to $20,500 per academic year for graduate and professional program students. Additionally, a student without financial need may borrow an additional amount of Unsubsidized Loans up to the limit of the Direct Subsidized Loan at their respective academic grade level. The total Direct Loan aggregate borrowing limit for undergraduate students is $57,500 and $138,500 for graduate students, which is inclusive of Direct Subsidized Loan amounts borrowed as an undergraduate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | PLUS and Grad PLUS Loans: Enables a graduate student or parents of a dependent undergraduate student to borrow additional funds to meet the cost of the student’s education. These loans are not based on financial need, nor are they subsidized. Interest begins to accrue, and repayment obligations begin, immediately after the loan is fully disbursed, but may be deferred until a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Graduate students and parents may borrow funds up to the cost of attendance, which includes allowances for tuition, fees and living expenses. Both PLUS and Grad PLUS are subject to credit approval, which generally requires the borrower to be free of any current adverse credit conditions. A co-borrower may be used to meet the credit requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Federal Perkins Loan: A low-interest loan available only to those students who demonstrate exceptional financial need with interest and principal repayment deferred until nine months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. The maximum Federal Perkins Loan amount is established by the institution, but cannot exceed $5,500 per award year. Ongoing funding for this program is provided from collections on loans issued in previous years. When students repay principal and interest on these loans, that money goes to the pool of funds available for future loans to students at the same institution. The authorization of the Federal Perkins Loan Program is made separate in the HEA from the Direct Loan Programs and is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Federal Work-study. This program offers work opportunities, both on or off campus, on a part-time basis to students who demonstrate financial need. Federal Work-study wages are paid partly from federal funds and partly from qualified employer funds.
State Financial Aid Programs
 
Certain states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Vermont, offer state grant and loan assistance to eligible undergraduate students attending Adtalem institutions.

Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs
 
Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada (other than students from the Northwest Territories, Nunavet or Quebec) are eligible for loans under the Canada Student Loans Program, which is financed by the Canadian government. Eligibility and amount of funding vary by province. Students attending AUC, RUSM, RUSVM or DeVry University online in the U.S. may be eligible for the Canada Student Loan Program. The loans are interest-free while the student is in school, and repayment begins six months after the student leaves school. Qualified students also may benefit from Canada Study Grants (designed for students whose financial needs and special circumstances cannot otherwise be met), tax-free withdrawals from retirement savings plans, tax-free education savings plans, loan repayment extensions and interest relief on loans.
Information about Other Financial Aid Programs
 
Private Loan Programs
 
Some Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students rely on private (non-federal) loan programs for financial assistance. These programs are used to finance the gap between a student’s educational and living costs and their financial aid awards. The amount of the typical loan varies significantly according to the student’s enrollment and financial aid awards.
 
Most private loans are approved using the student’s or a co-borrower’s credit history. The cost of these loans varies, but in almost all cases will be more costly than the federal programs. The application process is separate from the traditional financial aid process. Student finance personnel at Adtalem’s degree-granting institutions coordinate these processes so that students generally receive assistance from the federal and state programs before utilizing private loans.
 
Adtalem does not maintain a preferred lender list, but does list all of the lenders that made private loans to Adtalem students in the previous year and still offer loans to Adtalem students.
 
Tax-favored Programs
 
The U.S. has a number of tax-favored programs aimed at promoting savings for future college expenses. These include state-sponsored “529” college savings plans, state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, education savings accounts (formerly known as education IRAs), custodial accounts for minors, Hope and Lifetime Learning credits and tax deductions for interest on student loans.
Brazilian Government Financial Aid Programs
 
Adtalem Brazil students are eligible for loans under Brazil’s FIES public loan program (“Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil” or “Students Financing Fund”), which is financed by the Brazilian government. Adtalem Brazil also participates in PROUNI (“Programa Universidade para Todos” or “University for All Program”), a Brazilian governmental program, which provides federal tax incentives to educational institutions in exchange for providing scholarships to lower income undergraduate students.
 
FIES targets students from low socio-economic backgrounds enrolled at private postsecondary institutions. Eligible students receive loans with below market interest rates that are required to be repaid after an 18-month grace period upon graduation. FIES pays participating educational institutions tax credits, which can be used to pay certain federal taxes and social contributions. FIES repurchases excess credits for cash. FIES deducts from periodic payments to Adtalem Brazil an average amount of 5.81% to cover administrative expenses (5.63%) and student defaults (0.18%). There is no additional cost to Adtalem Brazil if students fail to pay their loans under the applicable rules. In fiscal year 2017, approximately 26% of Adtalem Brazil’s degree-seeking students were financing their education under the FIES program, and approximately 28% of Adtalem Brazil revenue was associated with the program.
 
PROUNI promotes the offering of tuition discounts in private postsecondary education schools by granting federal tax incentives for the participating institutions. Discounts reduce tuition by either 50% or 100%. The percentage is driven by rules defined by the Brazilian government based on family monthly earnings. Neither Adtalem Brazil nor its students receive direct funding from the federal government for the tuition discounts granted. Instead, Adtalem Brazil reduces its income tax expense and its income tax liability for the amount of the discounts issued. As of June 30, 2017, approximately 21% of Adtalem Brazil’s undergraduate students have obtained scholarships under the PROUNI program.
 
The FIES and PROUNI programs are required to be managed in accordance with government standards. Any regulatory violation can be the basis for disciplinary action, including suspension, limitation or termination of rights under the financial assistance program.

In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of FIES and PROUNI must maintain satisfactory academic progress towards completion of their programs of study and an appropriate grade point average every semester.
 
During fiscal year 2015, the Brazilian postsecondary education sector experienced significant funding changes. Government financial aid initiatives have impacted enrollment growth trends. The Brazilian government has stated that it is supportive of the FIES program, which is important in helping achieve the national goal of increasing the number of college graduates; however, changes enacted in calendar year 2015 to the FIES regulations added restrictions limiting student eligibility for FIES funding and extended the government’s time to disburse funding to participating institutions. These changes include reducing the number of new FIES contracts, decreasing the monthly maximum family income limits that students’ families must not exceed to qualify for a FIES loan, and adding minimum required entrance test scores in order to qualify for a FIES loan. Many educational groups and private institutions have experienced a decline in new student enrollment as a result of the new FIES regulations. In addition, the annual interest rate borrowers are charged increased from 3.4% to 6.5%. In 2016, the Brazilian government increased the maximum family income limits that students´ families must not exceed to qualify for loans from 2.5 to 3 times the minimum wage. This increased the population that qualifies for these FIES loans.
 
Adtalem-Provided Financial Assistance
 
Chamberlain students are eligible for numerous Adtalem-sponsored scholarships. Both merit and need based programs are offered, with awards ranging from $1,000 to $2,500 per semester.
 
Students at AUC may be eligible for an institutional scholarships. The scholarships range from $5,000 $ 47,500 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Students at RUSM may be eligible for an institutional scholarships. The scholarships range from $3,000 to up a full semester of tuition to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Students at RUSVM may be eligible for an institutional scholarships. The scholarships range from $600 to $24,000 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees.
 
DeVry University undergraduate students are eligible for numerous Adtalem-sponsored scholarships, grants and tuition savings opportunities. Scholarship and grant programs generally are designed to help make the degree more affordable for students. Besides various scholarship offerings, DeVry University also provides tuition discounts for employer partners’ employees as well as military students and their spouses, which range from 10% to 60%.
 
Carrington students are eligible for numerous Adtalem-sponsored scholarships. Scholarship programs generally are designed to attract recent high school graduates, friends and family of current students and alumni, and to assist students’ access to key high demand fields. Awards can range from $1,500 to $2,000 for certificate programs.
 
Adtalem’s institutional loan programs are available to students at its Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington institutions. These loan programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs consisting of tuition, books and fees and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM and RUSVM loans may be used for students’ living expenses. Repayment plans for institutional loan program balances are developed to address the financial circumstances of the particular student. Interest charges accrue each month on the unpaid balance. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington require that students begin repaying loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to demonstrate their capability to repay and reduce the possibility of over borrowing and to minimize interest being accrued on the loan balance. Payments may increase upon completing or departing the program. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan. In addition, the Becker CPA Exam Review Course can be financed through Becker with an 18-month term loan program.
 
The institutional loans do not impose any origination fees, in general have a fixed rate of interest, and most carry annual and aggregate maximums that ensure that they are only a supplemental source of funding and not relied on as the main source. Borrowers must be current in their payments in order to be eligible for subsequent disbursements. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the loans and counseled to utilize all federal funding options. Credit scores of 620 and above are required for eligibility for institutional loans for DeVry University students.
 
Adtalem institutional loans are carried on our balance sheet, net of related reserves, and there are no relationships with external parties that shift the risk away from Adtalem.

Employer-Provided Tuition Assistance
 
Chamberlain and DeVry University students who receive employer tuition assistance may choose from several deferred tuition payment plans. Students eligible for tuition reimbursement plans may have their tuition billed directly to their employers or payment may be deferred until after the end of the session. Educational expenses paid by an employer on behalf of an employee generally are excludable from the employee’s income if provided under a qualified educational assistance plan. At present, the maximum annual exclusion is $5,250.
Becker Professional Education
 
Students taking the Becker review courses are not eligible for federal or state financial aid, but many receive partial or full tuition reimbursement from their employers. Private loans are also available to students to help meet the program costs. In addition, Becker’s CPA Exam Review Course can be financed through Becker under an 18-month term loan program.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
 
Extensive and complex regulations govern all government grant, loan and work study programs in which Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Adtalem Brazil, DeVry University, Carrington and their respective students participate. Like all other educational institutions, Adtalem’s administration of these programs is regularly reviewed by various regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other governmental authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including the suspension, limitation or termination of an institution’s eligibility to participate in financial aid programs.
U.S. Federal Regulations
 
Our domestic postsecondary institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The HEA and the related ED regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in Title IV programs, and provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following:

· | The federal government through ED;
--+-----------------------------------


· | The accrediting agencies recognized by ED; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | State higher education regulatory bodies.
--+------------------------------------------

 
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must comply with the HEA and all applicable regulations thereunder, and must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution operates, as applicable.
 
In addition to governance by the regulatory triad, there has been substantial and continuing increased focus in recent years by members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including ED, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions have been held regarding various aspects of the education industry, and reports have been issued that are highly critical of proprietary institutions and include a number of recommendations to be considered by Congress in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the HEA. In addition, in October 2014, ED formed an inter-agency task force involving multiple federal agencies and departments including the FTC, the U.S. Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, the CFPB, the SEC, and numerous state attorneys general, to coordinate activities and share information to protect students from unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices. We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future.
 
Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, and operating costs. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals, accreditation, or state authorizations could have a material adverse effect on us. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV-eligible institutions is unable to pay its obligations under its program participation agreement as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the first institution’s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem’s Title IV institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Adtalem’s other institutions and Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of Adtalem’s other institutions and Adtalem as a whole to operate. For further information, see “A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
 

27
--

 

We have summarized the most significant regulatory requirements applicable to our domestic postsecondary operations. Adtalem and DeVry University have been significantly impacted by these regulations and enforcement efforts and are currently facing multiple related lawsuits arising from the enhanced scrutiny facing the proprietary education sector. For information regarding such pending investigations and litigation, and the potential impact such matters could have on our institutions or on Adtalem, see in this Form 10-K: (1) “Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, (2) the subsection of “Item 1A – Risk Factors” entitled “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry,” and (3) the subsection of “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
Eligibility and Certification Procedures
 
The HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs. Every educational institution participating in the Title IV programs must be certified to participate and is required to periodically renew this certification. Institutions that violate certain ED Title IV regulations, including its financial responsibility and administrative capability regulations, may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or may only continue participation under provisional certification. Schools that do not meet financial responsibility requirements are required to submit a letter of credit equal to at least 10% their prior fiscal year Title IV disbursements and submit to ED’s heightened cash monitoring process. Provisional certification status carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, ED may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified.
Defense to Repayment Regulations
 
Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations, which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. ED’s current Defense to Repayment Regulations permit a borrower to assert a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan if the institution’s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law (“Defense to Repayment Regulations”). On October 28, 2016, ED published final regulations (the “2016 DtR Regulations”) expanding defenses and addressing other related matters, including certain circumstances under which ED may impose a fine, or limit, suspend, or terminate an institution’s participation in Title IV programs. The 2016 DtR Regulations create a new federal standard for borrower defenses to repayment of Direct Loans, new limitation periods for such claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. On June 14, 2017, ED announced that, due to pending litigation, it is indefinitely postponing implementing the majority of 2016 DtR Regulations, which were due to take effect on July 1, 2017. ED also announced its intention to re-evaluate the 2016 DtR Regulations. Management is unable to predict what any revised regulations may contain, the result of any other current or future rulemakings, or the impact of such rulemakings on our business. A summary of the key 2016 DtR Regulations is set forth below to provide an understanding of the potential scope of the new regulations and to summarize the 2016 DtR Regulations that will be effective if ED does not complete its rulemaking process.
 
Under the 2016 DtR Regulations, for Direct Loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, ED would consider a borrower defense claim in accordance with the existing provisions, i.e., whether the institution’s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. For Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017, a borrower could assert a defense to repayment based on one of three types of claims:
 
· | Breach of contract, if the institution failed to perform its obligations under the terms of a contract with the student;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Substantial misrepresentation, if the institution or its agents made a substantial misrepresentation on which the borrower reasonably relied when the borrower decided to attend or to continue attending the institution; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Judgment against the institution, if a governmental agency or the borrower as an individual or a member of a class obtained a non-default favorable judgment against the institution before a court or administrative agency for matters related to the making of a loan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The 2016 DtR Regulations set forth two sets of procedures for borrower defense claims, one for individual borrowers and one for groups of borrowers identified by ED. For claims filed by individual borrowers, at the conclusion of a fact-finding process, ED would issue a final decision as to the merit of the claims and any relief granted to the borrower. ED would be able to initiate a separate proceeding to collect from the institution the amount of relief granted to the borrower. The group process would allow ED to identify a group of borrowers with common borrower defense claims based on individual claims filed or other sources. After a hearing concerning a group claim, ED would collect from the institution any liability assessed against the institution for relief granted to the borrowers.
 

28
--

 

The 2016 DtR Regulations also modified ED’s financial responsibility standards to provide that an institution (other than a public institution) is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations, and is therefore not financially responsible, if it is subject to one or more automatic or discretionary triggering events.
 
If ED were to determine that an institution is not financially responsible because of the 2016 DtR Regulation triggering events, the institution would be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit in connection with each triggering event equal to, in most cases, at least 10% of the amount of federal student financial aid funds received by the institution for the past year. An institution with multiple triggering events would be required to post cumulative letters of credit. An institution that is required to provide a letter of credit would also be required to disclose to students information about the letter of credit. Given the significant uncertainties in the regulations and the latitude provided to ED, it is possible that the new regulations may create significant liability or cause us to have to post a significant letter of credit that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
In addition to the disclosure to students about the institution’s letter of credit obligations, the 2016 DtR Regulations included a loan repayment warning requirement applicable solely to proprietary institutions. If a proprietary institution has a loan repayment rate that is less than or equal to zero during any fiscal year, it would be required to deliver a warning to prospective and enrolled students and also to place a warning on its website, its promotional materials, and its advertisements. An institution would have a loan repayment rate less than or equal to zero if the median in the population of borrowers has not paid down any of his or her loan balance within five years after leaving school.
 
In addition to the outcome from any legal proceeding instituted by a private party or governmental authority, facts asserted in pending or future lawsuits or the outcome of any pending or future governmental inquiry, lawsuit or enforcement action described in this Form 10-K in (1) “Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and (2) the subsection of Item 7 entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” could serve as the basis for individual borrowers or by ED on behalf of a group of borrowers under the Defense to Repayment Regulations, the posting of substantial letters of credit, or the termination of eligibility of one of our institutions to participate in the Title IV program based on ED’s institutional capability assessment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate.
 
Gainful Employment
 
Gainful Employment (“GE”) regulations became effective on July 1, 2015. Programs that fail GE accountability metrics in two out of any three consecutive years or do not pass in any four consecutive years will be disqualified from participation in the Title IV programs for a period of three years, and an institution is prohibited from establishing Title IV eligibility for any substantially similar program during that period.
 
Approximately 11% of Adtalem’s 2014-2015 academic year programs fell into the failing category, and approximately 15% of Adtalem’s programs fell into the zone category, including the RUSVM’s veterinary medicine program. Adtalem provided required warnings to enrolled and prospective students with respect to GE programs considered under the regulations to be in jeopardy of losing Title IV eligibility in February 2017. Management expects that certain programs will be able to avoid falling into the zone or failing categories in future years through adjustments to program price, or, if appropriate and consistent with programmatic standards, the duration of programs. For programs where such adjustments or initiatives are not feasible, which may include RUSVM’s veterinary medicine program, we may discontinue such programs or direct students to third-party lenders for financial support of student tuition and other expenses. These adjustments or initiatives, or any requirement to issue warnings to enrolled and prospective students, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our ability to operate. Management expects RUSVM will continue to be in the zone for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years, as well as, if potential initiatives to improve graduate incomes are not executable, are not executed or are unsuccessful, the 2017-2018 academic year. This is possible notwithstanding strong student outcomes and very low Cohort Default Rates for RUSVM graduates (0.7% as of September 30, 2013, the latest 3-year cohort period for which official data is available). In March 2017, ED delayed implementation of some portions of the GE reporting regulations until July 1, 2017. While the delay does not affect RUSVM’s status, ED indicated in the delay announcement that its action was taken to allow ED to further review the GE regulations and their implementation, On June 16, 2017, ED then announced its intention to re-negotiate these rules. The timing and effective date of any future final regulations cannot be determined at this time. If the GE regulations and guidance are not changed prior to 2019 and RUSVM’s veterinary program is determined by ED to be the zone for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years, RUSVM would be required to issue warnings to students as early as 2019 that Title IV funding may no longer be available to students attending RUSVM. Further, if RUSVM’s veterinary program is determined to be in the zone for the 2017-2018 academic year, RUSVM students would no longer have access to Title IV student aid as early as the beginning of 2020, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

“90/10 Rule”
 
An ED regulation known as the “90/10 Rule” affects only proprietary postsecondary institutions, such as Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington. Under this regulation, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV student financial assistance programs in two consecutive fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in these programs for at least two fiscal years. The following table details the percentage of revenue on a cash basis from federal financial assistance programs (excluding Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and military tuition assistance benefits) for each of Adtalem’s Title IV-eligible institutions for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Final data for fiscal year 2017 is not yet available.

 | Fiscal Year | 
--------------------------------------------------------+-------------+---
 | 2016 | | | 2015
Chamberlain University | | 64 | % | | 65 | %
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | | 79 | % | | 80 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | | 82 | % | | 80 | %
Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine | | 83 | % | | 84 | %
DeVry University | | 63 | % | | 66 | %
Carrington College: | | | | | | 
California | | 78 | % | | 76 | %
Boise | | 69 | % | | 70 | %
Portland | | 77 | % | | 76 | %
Phoenix | | 80 | % | | 80 | %

 
In September 2016, Adtalem committed to voluntarily limit to 85% the amount of revenue that each of its six Title IV institutions derive from federal funding, including VA and military tuition assistance benefits. Management anticipates its institutions have met this lower threshold as of June 30, 2017, and will publicly report the results of the third party review verifying adherence to the voluntary limit.
 
Incentive Compensation
 
An educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. The law and regulations governing this requirement never established clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, but, prior to 2011, there were 12 safe harbors that defined specific types of compensation that were deemed to constitute permissible incentive compensation. The new rules effective in 2011 eliminated the 12 safe harbors. These changes increase the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation. This makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. As such, these changes limit Adtalem’s ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. Management believes that Adtalem has not been, nor is currently, involved in any activities that violate the restrictions on commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds.

Standards of Financial Responsibility
 
A separate financial responsibility test for continued participation by an institution’s students in U.S. federal financial assistance programs is based upon a composite score of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution’s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution’s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution’s ability to operate profitably. A minimum score of 1.5 is necessary to meet ED’s financial standards. Institutions with scores of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered financially responsible, but require additional oversight. These schools are subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score less than 1.0 is considered not financially responsible. However, a school with a score less than 1.0 may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the school be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10% of the Title IV aid it received in the institution's most recent fiscal year).
 
For the past several years, Adtalem’s composite score has exceeded the required minimum of 1.5. If Adtalem becomes unable to meet requisite financial responsibility standards or otherwise demonstrate, within the regulations, its ability to continue to provide educational services, then Adtalem could be subject to heightened cash monitoring or be required to post a letter of credit to enable its students to continue to participate in federal financial assistance programs.
 
Administrative Capability
 
The HEA directs ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny its eligibility for Title IV programs.
State Authorization
 
Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington are specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions that require such authorizations. Some states assert authority to regulate all degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington have obtained licensure in states which require such licensure and where their students are enrolled.
 
On December 19, 2016, ED published new rules concerning requirements for institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. The regulations, which become effective beginning July 1, 2018, require an institution offering distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state from which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. If an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education or correspondence courses in a state that participates in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, and the institution offering the program is located in a state where it is also covered by such an agreement, the institution would be considered legally authorized to offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education in the state where courses are offered via distance education, subject to any limitations in that agreement. The regulations also require an institution to document the state processes for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses. With regard to additional locations or branch campuses located in foreign countries, the regulations require that such campuses be authorized by an appropriate government agency of the country where the additional location or branch campus is located and, if at least half of an educational program can be completed at the location or branch campus, be approved by the institution's accrediting agency and be reported to the state where the institution's main campus is located. Lastly, the regulations require that an institution provide certain disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs offered solely through distance education or correspondence courses.
 
Cohort Default Rates
 
ED has instituted strict regulations that penalize institutions whose students have high default rates on federal student loans. Depending on the type of loan, a loan is considered in default after the borrower becomes at least 270 or 360 days past due. For a variety of reasons, higher default rates are often found in private-sector institutions and community colleges — many of which tend to have a higher percentage of low-income students enrolled than do four-year publicly supported and independent colleges and universities.
 
Educational institutions are penalized to varying degrees under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, depending on the default rate for the “cohort” defined in the statute. An institution with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20% for the year is required to develop a plan to reduce defaults, but the institution’s operations and its students’ ability to utilize student loans are not restricted. An institution with a cohort default rate of 30% or more for three consecutive years is ineligible to participate in these loan programs and cannot offer student loans administered by ED for the fiscal year in which the ineligibility determination is made and for the next two fiscal years. Students attending an institution whose cohort default rate has exceeded 30% for three consecutive years also are ineligible for Pell Grants. Any institution with a cohort default rate of 40% or more in any year is subject to immediate limitation, suspension or termination proceedings from all federal aid programs.

According to ED, the three-year cohort default rate for all colleges and universities eligible for federal financial aid decreased to 11.3% in fiscal year 2013 (the latest period for which data are available) from 11.8% in fiscal year 2012.
 
Default rates for Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students follow. The latest period for which final three-year data is available is 2013.
 

 | Cohort Default Rate | 
--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----
 | 2013 | | | 2012
Chamberlain University | | 3.6 | % | | 3.8 | %
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | | 0.5 | % | | 0.0 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | | 0.7 | % | | 0.4 | %
Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine | | 0.7 | % | | 0.6 | %
DeVry University | | 10.6 | % | | 12.6 | %
DeVry University: Federal Perkins Loan Program | | 15.3 | % | | 20.4 | %
Carrington College: | | | | | | 
California | | 13.6 | % | | 15.1 | %
Boise | | 13.1 | % | | 10.3 | %
Portland | | 11.1 | % | | 15.7 | %
Phoenix | | 17.9 | % | | 17.5 | %

 
The three-year cohort default rates for Carrington College-Phoenix were in excess of 15% for the most recent year (2013). In accordance with ED regulations, disbursement of Title IV Stafford Loans for new students is delayed for a thirty day period for any institution with a cohort default rate in excess of 15%. Management believes that the delay in the related cash receipts for this Adtalem institution will not materially affect its operations or cash flow.
 
Under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, the institution is responsible for collecting outstanding loans. Any institution with a Perkins loan cohort default rate exceeding 15% must establish a default reduction plan. Adtalem has worked to reduce the default rates for all loan programs by implementing financial awareness and student counseling programs and retaining outside loan servicing agencies to contact former students and inform them of their repayment options.
 
Carrington College has recently reassigned all outstanding Perkins loans to ED, and is no longer making new awards or disbursements. This action was taken based on the small size of the loan portfolio and in advance of the expiration of the authorization to award new loans, which will occur in September 2017.
 
Student-Right-to-Know-Act
 
Institutions that participate in U.S. federal financial aid programs must disclose information upon request about undergraduate student “completion rates” to current and prospective students. The federal Student-Right-To-Know Act defines the cohort of students on which the institution must report as “first-time, full-time, degree-seeking” students who enter the fall term. Completion rates calculated in accordance with the statute for each of DeVry University’s U.S. undergraduate campuses generally fall within the range of completion rates at selected four-year urban public colleges serving low-income students in the areas in which its campuses are located. However, DeVry University’s overall completion rate for full-time students (not limited to first-time, full-time-students, who comprise only approximately 19% of DeVry University’s entering class) is more representative of DeVry University’s student population and is higher than reported in these statistics. Many DeVry University students have previously attended other colleges, but these students are not included in the completion rate statistics that are defined by the Student-Right-To-Know Act. Completion rates for undergraduate students entering with previous college experience generally are higher than for first-time students. In an effort to improve our completion rates as defined by the statute, DeVry University has enhanced its student support services. For 2010 freshman students (the latest period for which final completion statistics are available), the first-time, full-time degree-seeking graduation rate for DeVry University U.S. undergraduates was 26.0%.

Satisfactory Academic Progress
 
In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study and an appropriate grade point average.
 
Change of Ownership or Control
 
Any change of ownership or control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of Adtalem’s Title IV-eligible institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by our institutions’ accreditors and/or reauthorization by state licensing agencies. If we experience a change of ownership or control, then Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. There is no assurance that such recertification would be obtained on a timely basis. After a change in ownership or control, most institutions will participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period of one to three years.
 
In addition, most institutions would be required to report any material change in stock ownership to their principal institutional accrediting body, including in the case of Chamberlain and DeVry University, the HLC, and would be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, the applicable accreditor may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of the affected institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review.
 
In addition, some states in which our institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control.
 
Refer to “If regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions’ accreditation and our institutions’ state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
 
Brazil Regulations
 
Governmental regulations in foreign countries significantly affect our international operations. New or revised interpretations of regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in existing or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate, permissible activities, and costs of doing business outside of the U.S. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our international operations.
State Approvals and Licensing
 
Adtalem institutions require authorizations from many state higher education authorities or Canadian ministries to recruit students, operate schools, conduct exam preparation courses and grant degrees. Generally, the addition of any new program of study or new operating location also requires approval by the appropriate licensing and regulatory agencies. In the U.S., each Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington location is approved to grant certificates, diplomas, associate, bachelor’s, master’s and/or doctorate degrees by the respective state in which it is located. Additionally, many states require approval for out-of-state institutions to recruit within their state or offer instruction through online modalities to residents of their states. Adtalem believes it is in compliance with all state requirements as an out-of-state institution. AUC and RUSM clinical programs are accredited as part of their programs of medical education by their respective accrediting bodies, approved by the appropriate boards in those states that have a formal process to do so, and are reported to ED as required.
 
Many states and Canadian provinces require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted approximately $20.0 million of surety bonds with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, Becker, DeVry University and Carrington.

Certain states have set standards of financial responsibility that differ from those prescribed by federal regulation. Adtalem believes it is in material compliance with state and Canadian provincial regulations. If Adtalem were unable to meet the tests of financial responsibility for a specific jurisdiction, and could not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility, Adtalem could be required to cease operations in that state. To date, Adtalem has successfully demonstrated its financial responsibility where required.
 
SEASONALITY
 
Adtalem’s quarterly revenue and net income fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments. Generally, the schools’ highest enrollment and revenue typically occur in the fall, which corresponds to the second and third quarters of Adtalem’s fiscal year. Enrollment is slightly lower in the spring, and the lowest enrollment generally occurs during the summer months. Adtalem’s operating costs do not fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis.
 
Results of operations reflect both this seasonal enrollment pattern and the pattern of student recruiting activity costs that precede the start of every term. Revenue, operating income and net income by quarter for each of the past two fiscal years are included in “Note 18: Quarterly Financial Data” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
