ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Spectrum”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a biopharma company, with a primary strategy comprised of acquiring, developing, and commercializing novel and targeted oncology therapies. Our in-house development organization includes clinical development, regulatory, quality and data management. We plan to build out our commercial and marketing capabilities in the second half of 2020 to prepare for the launch of ROLONTIS.
We have three drugs in development:

• | ROLONTIS, a novel long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating (“G-CSF”) for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia which has been filed with the FDA and has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date of October 24, 2020;


• | Poziotinib, a novel irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor under investigation for non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) tumors with various mutations; and


• | Anti-CD20-IFNá, an antibody-interferon fusion molecule directed against CD20 that is in Phase 1 development for treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (“NHL”) patients (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma).

Our business strategy is the development of our late-stage assets through commercialization and the sourcing of additional assets that are synergistic with our existing portfolio (through purchase acquisitions, in-licensing transactions, or co-development and marketing arrangements).
On March 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our seven then-commercialized drugs, including FUSILEV, KHAPZORY, FOLOTYN, ZEVALIN, MARQIBO, BELEODAQ, and EVOMELA (the “Commercial Product Portfolio”) to Acrotech Biopharma LLC (“Acrotech”) (the “Commercial Product Portfolio Transaction”). Upon closing we received $158.8 million in an upfront cash payment of which $4 million was held in escrow until November 5, 2019. We are also entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $140 million upon Acrotech’s future achievement of certain regulatory milestones (totaling $40 million) and sales-based milestones (totaling $100 million) relating to the Commercial Product Portfolio. 
Cancer Background and Market Size
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, which can result in death. The development of cancer is multi-factorial and includes both external factors (tobacco, infectious organisms, chemicals, and radiation) and internal factors (inherited mutations, hormones, immune conditions, and mutations that occur from exposure to environmental factors or errors in making DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) during normal cell division). These causal factors may act together or in sequence to initiate or promote the development of cancer. Ten or more years often pass between exposure to these factors and the development of detectable cancer. Cancer is treated through surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and/or targeted drug therapy.
According to the American Cancer Society’s publication Cancer Facts & Figures 2019, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. (only behind heart disease). In the U.S., approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in 2019 and approximately 607,000 persons were expected to die from the disease. Anyone can develop cancer. Since the risk of being diagnosed with cancer increases with age, most cases occur in adults who are middle aged or older. About 80% of all cancers are diagnosed in people 55 years of age or older. In the U.S., approximately 39 out of 100 men and 38 out of 100 women will develop cancer during their lifetime. These probabilities are estimated based on the overall experience of the general population. Individuals within the population may have higher or lower risk because of differences in exposures (e.g., smoking), and/or genetic susceptibility. In addition, currently available treatments are variably effective in the different 
cancers and individual patients. Together these patients’ risks and the treatment limitations suggest a significant current and long-term demand for improved and novel cancer treatments.
Product Portfolio
Our product portfolio consists of in-development drug products for the treatment of cancer patients. Serious adverse effects (“SAEs”) in patients from these products could result in the refusal/removal of regulatory approval and have a negative impact on future sales. See our specific SAE risk factor within Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business --Reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving our in-development products or similar agents, could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval or negatively impact sales.
Product Pipeline 
ROLONTIS
ROLONTIS (eflapegrastim injection) is a novel long-acting G-CSF that employs a proprietary technology to enhance the duration of therapeutic effects and reduces the frequency of administration. ROLONTIS is being investigated for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. In January 2012, we entered into a co-development and commercialization agreement for ROLONTIS worldwide rights, except for Korea, China, and Japan, with Hanmi, based on their proprietary LAPSCOVERY™ technology. 
Chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression and unacceptably low levels of white blood cells, making patients prone to infections, hospitalizations, and interruption of chemotherapy treatments.
Neutropenia, a common side effect of chemotherapy, is a condition where the number of neutrophils or white blood cells are too low, and can lead to infection, hospitalization, and even death. G-CSF stimulates the production of white blood cells by the bone marrow. A recombinant form of G-CSF is used in appropriate cancer patients to accelerate recovery from neutropenia after chemotherapy, allowing higher-intensity treatment regimens to be given at full-dose and on schedule. The worldwide annual market opportunity for long-acting G-CSF-related drugs is over $4 billion, based on a 2016 revenue and sales analysis performed by Evaluate Pharma. 
In October 2019, integrated results from our pivotal Phase 3 studies (ADVANCE Study, or SPI-GCF-301and RECOVER Study, or SPI-GCF-302) were presented during a poster session at the 2019 Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Symposium in San Francisco. The integrated efficacy and safety data from both trials were consistent with results from the individual trials, demonstrating that ROLONTIS was non-inferior to pegfilgrastim in the reduction of duration of severe neutropenia in all four cycles of treatment. The integrated data also demonstrated that eflapegrastim provided an absolute risk reduction of severe neutropenia of 6.5% compared to pegfilgrastim in Cycle 1.
We submitted our updated Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for ROLONTIS with the FDA on October 24, 2019. As previously announced, the BLA was accepted for review by the FDA on December 20, 2019. Our Prescription Drug User Fee Act date for the FDA’s potential approval of ROLONTIS has been set for October 24, 2020.
Poziotinib
Poziotinib is a novel, pan-HER inhibitor that irreversibly blocks signaling through the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) family of tyrosine-kinase receptors, including HER1 (erbB1; EGFR), HER2 (erbB2), HER4 (erbB4), and HER receptor mutations. This, in turn, leads to the inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells that over-express these receptors. Mutations or over-expression/amplification of EGFR family receptors have been associated with a number of different cancers, including NSCLC, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. 
Our clinical development program for poziotinib is focused on previously treated NSCLC, first-line treatment of NSCLC and treatment of other solid tumors with EGFR or HER2 mutations. NSCLC tumors with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are rare and have generally not been responsive to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients with these mutations have a poor prognosis, and available treatment options are limited. Poziotinib, due to its unique chemical structure and characteristics, is believed to inhibit cell growth of tumors with EGFR or HER2 exon-20 insertion mutations. 
In collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”), an investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial was initiated in NSCLC patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutations (the “MD Anderson Phase 2 Trial”) in March 2017. In September 2018 we announced preliminary poziotinib data from the MD Anderson Phase 2 Trial which were 
released during an oral presentation at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer. This Phase 2 trial demonstrated anti-tumor activity for poziotinib in metastatic, heavily pretreated EGFR exon 20 mutant NSCLC. This data is summarized below:

• | In 44 evaluable patients with EGFR exon-20 mutations, the confirmed overall response rate was 43% and disease control rate was 90%. Median progression free survival was 5.5 months.


• | In evaluable patients with HER2 exon-20 mutations, the confirmed overall response rate was 42% and disease control rate was 83%. Median progression free survival was 5.1 months.


• | EGFR-related toxicities (including rash, diarrhea, and paronychia) were manageable and required dose reductions in 60% of patients. Discontinuation due to poor tolerance was rare (approximately 3% of patients).

In October 2017, we announced the start of a pivotal Phase 2 global study with active sites in the U.S., Canada and Europe (“ZENITH20”). The ZENITH20 study consists of seven cohorts of NSCLC patients. Cohorts 1 (EGFR) and 2 (HER2) have completed enrollment of previously treated NSCLC patients with exon 20 mutations. Cohort 3 (EGFR) and 4 (HER2) are currently enrolling first-line NSCLC patients with exon 20 mutations. Cohorts 1- 4 are each independently powered for a pre-specified statistical hypothesis and the primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). Cohort 5 includes previously treated or treatment-naïve NSCLC patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. Cohort 6 includes NSCLC patients with classical EGFR mutations who progressed while on treatment with first-line osimertinib and developed an additional EGFR mutation. Cohort 7 includes NSCLC patients with a variety of less common mutations in EGFR or HER2 exons 18-21 or the extracellular or transmembrane domains.
On December 26, 2019, we announced that the pre-specified primary endpoint in its Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating poziotinib in previously treated NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations was not met in Cohort 1 of the ZENITH20 trial. Cohort 1 enrolled a total of 115 patients who received 16 mg/day of poziotinib. The intent-to-treat analysis showed that 17 patients had a response (by RECIST) and 62 patients had stable disease for a 68.7% disease control rate (DCR). The confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 14.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 8.9%-22.6%). The median duration of response was 7.4 months and progression free survival was 4.2 months. The safety profile was in-line with other second-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The results for this cohort have been accepted for a podium presentation at the 11th Annual Congress on Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine in Amsterdam in March 2020. We expect to announce topline results for Cohort 2 in mid-2020 and for Cohort 3 by the end of 2020. 
In addition, a basket study has been initiated to investigate poziotinib in patients with EGFR or HER2 mutation-positive malignant solid tumors in an investigator-led study, with the first patient enrolled by MD Anderson in late 2019.
Anti-CD20-IFNá
On April 15, 2019, we executed a license agreement with ImmunGene, Inc. (“ImmunGene”) for an antibody-interferon fusion molecule directed against CD20 (Anti-CD20-IFNá) and is in Phase 1 development for treating relapsed or refractory NHL, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients (representing a considerable unmet medical need). Under the terms of this agreement, we received the exclusive rights to commercialize this drug for any indication, and are financially responsible for the clinical and regulatory development programs.

For information on our net loss, see Item 8 of Part II to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, for information regarding possible adverse events or safety concerns regarding our development stage products, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving each of our products or similar agents, sold by us or our development partners and/or licensees, could delay or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval or negatively impact sales.
Manufacturing
We currently do not have internal manufacturing capabilities. All of our products are/were manufactured by third parties that specialize in these services. We expect to continue to contract with third-parties for our manufacturing and packaging requirements, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished-dosage products. We believe that our current agreements provide sufficient capacity to support our clinical requirements and anticipated commercial demand for our products. Where feasible, we maintain secondary supplier sources for our drug products to mitigate the risk of over-reliance on any single supplier. We attempt to prevent supply disruption through our executed supply agreements, appropriate forecasting, and maintaining base stock levels. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly-evolving technology and intense competition, which we expect to persist. Many companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to ours – both commercialized and in development, which fosters continuous innovation. In the event that one or more of our competitor’s programs are successful, the market for some of our drug products could be reduced or eliminated. Any product for which we obtain FDA approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share.
Our successful marketing of branded products, upon FDA approval, depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety, and value of the products to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices, hospitals, academic institutions, and managed care organizations. Competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease, advanced drug delivery, and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies. Unless our products are shown to be differentiated, i.e., have a better safety profile, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, compared to other alternatives, they may not gain acceptance by medical professionals and may therefore never be commercially successful.
Companies that have products on the market or in research and development that target the same indications as our in-development products or new compounds sought include, among others: Amgen, Inc., Coherus BioSciences, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sandoz, AstraZeneca plc, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, Rain Therapeutics Inc., Janssen Research & Development, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Cullinan Oncology, LLC, Genetech, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Novartis International AG.
Each of the aforementioned companies may be more advanced in the development of competing drug products. Many of these competitors are large and well-capitalized companies focusing on a wide range of cancer types and have substantially greater resources and expertise than we do.
We believe that the current competitive landscape for each of our key in-development products, is as follows:

(a) | ROLONTIS is a novel long-acting granulocyte colony-stimulating factor that employs a proprietary technology that prolongs the duration of biologics, reducing the frequency of administration. There is currently one novel long-acting G-CSF and three biosimilar G-CSFs marketed in the United States including, Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), marketed by Amgen, Inc., UDENYCA™ (pegfilgrastim-cbqv), a biosimilar marketed by Coherus BioSciences, Fulphila® (pegfilgrastim-jmdb), a biosimilar marketed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Ziextenzo® (pegfilgrastim-bmez), a biosimilar marketed by Sandoz, which recently received FDA approval during the fourth quarter of 2019.

(b) Poziotinib is a novel investigational, oral, quinazoline-based pan-HER inhibitor that irreversibly blocks signaling through the EGFR family of tyrosine-kinase receptors, including human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1\ErbB1/EGFR), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4), as well as HER receptor mutations. Poziotinib’s development program is primarily focused on advanced NSCLC patients harboring exon 20 insertion mutations in both HER1/Erb1/EGFR and HER2(ErbB2). At present there are no FDA approved therapies for metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations.
There are a number of other targeted therapies focused on this subtype of NSCLC that are in early clinical investigation by our potential competitors, including: TAK788 - Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, TAGRISSO (Osimertinib) - AstraZeneca, Tarlox (tarloxotinib) - Rain Therapeutics Inc., DS-8201a - Daiichi Sankyo, JNJ-61186372- Janssen Research & Development, and CLN081 - Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Cullinan Oncology, LLC.

(c) Anti-CD20-IFNá is in Phase 1 development for treating relapsed or refractory NHL, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. There are a number of targeted and immune-therapies approved for NHL, including Rituxan (rituximab) and Polivy (polatuzumab-vedotin-piiq) - Genentech, Inc., Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) - Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) - Novartis International AG, as well as many other targeted and immune-therapies in clinical investigation for NHL.
Research and Development
New drug development is the process whereby drug product candidates are tested for the purpose of filing a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or a BLA, in the U.S. (or similar filing in other countries). Obtaining marketing approval from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. is an inherently uncertain, lengthy, and expensive process that requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the appropriate regulatory authorities that the products are both safe and effective for their respective indications. Our development focus is primarily based on acquiring and developing late-stage development drugs as compared to new drug discovery, which is particularly uncertain and lengthy.
Our in-development products are summarized below:

Our research and development expenses for drug development are comprised of our personnel expenses, contracted services with third parties, license fees and milestone payments to third parties, clinical trial costs, laboratory supplies, drug products, and certain allocations of corporate costs. The below table summarizes our research and development expenses by project in 2019, 2018, and 2017:

 | Research and Development Expenses for the Year Ended December 31,(in thousands)

Patents and Proprietary Rights
Overview
We in-license from third parties certain patents and related intellectual property rights related to our proprietary drug products. Under most of these license arrangements, we are generally responsible for all development, patent filing, prosecution, and maintenance costs, sales, marketing and liability insurance costs related to the drug products.
In addition, these licenses and agreements may require us to make royalty and other payments and to reasonably utilize the underlying technology of applicable patents. If we fail to comply with these and other terms in these licenses and agreements, we could lose the underlying rights to one or more of our potential products, which would adversely affect our product development and harm our business. For more information regarding these arrangements see Note 10(b), “Financial Commitments & Contingencies and Key License Agreements,” to our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
The protection, preservation, and infringement-free commercial utilization of these patents and related intellectual property rights are very important to the successful execution of our strategy. However, the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. Accordingly, our patents and the patents we have licensed may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents. If our patent applications are not allowed or, even if allowed and issued as patents, if such patents or the patents we have in-licensed are circumvented or not upheld in a court of law or in administrative proceedings, including oppositions, re-examinations or inter parties review (“IPR”), our ability to competitively utilize our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced. Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, in which case our ability to commercially sell these products may be diminished.
From time-to-time, we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially exploit such products may be inhibited or prevented.
In-Development Drug Products - Patents and Licenses Summary
We believe that our patents and licenses are critical to operating our business, as summarized below.
ROLONTIS: Composition of matter patents covering ROLONTIS are due to expire in 2025 in the U.S. and in 2024 outside the U.S. We also have a ROLONTIS formulation patent granted in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other countries. The formulation patent will not expire in the U.S. until 2031. One of these patents is eligible for possible patent term extension following regulatory approval of ROLONTIS. ROLONTIS is also covered by additional patents and pending applications claiming various aspects of the technology and formulation that are due to expire between 2024 and 2030.
Poziotinib: A composition of matter patent covering poziotinib is due to expire in 2028. Poziotinib is also covered by additional patents and patent applications covering its formulations and synthetic processes which will expire between 2032 and 2034. We have licensed patent applications covering the use of poziotinib that if granted, would expire in 2037.
Anti-CD20-IFNá: We currently have licensed patents covering products derived from the FIT platform that will last through 2032.
Patent Protection and Value Maximization 
We are constantly evaluating our patent portfolio and are currently assessing and filing patent applications for our drug products and considering new patent applications in order to maximize the life cycle of each of our products.
While the U.S. and the European Union, or EU, are currently the largest potential markets for most of our products, we also have patents issued and patent applications pending outside of the U.S. and Europe. Limitations on patent protection in these countries, and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in countries outside the U.S., may limit the protection we have on patents issued or licensed to us outside of the U.S. In addition, laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws in the U.S.
To minimize our costs and expenses and to maintain effective protection, we usually focus our patent and licensing activities within the U.S., the EU, Canada, and Japan. In determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a certain foreign country, we weigh the relevant costs and benefits, and consider, among other things, the market potential and profitability, the scope of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction and its enforceability, and the nature of terms with any potential licensees. Failure to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary drugs and technology would impair our ability to be commercially competitive in these markets.
In conducting our business, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, and licensing arrangements. We use customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information such as confidentiality agreements and trade secret protection measures. It is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance, and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets or know-how will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. The protection of know-how is particularly important because it is often necessary or useful information that allows us to practice the claims in the patents related to our proprietary drug products.
In addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above, we have trademark registrations in the U.S. for Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.®, and ROLONTIS®. We also have trademarks for the Spectrum Pharmaceuticals’ logos. Any other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
Product Exclusivity
The Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) provides exclusivity protections for certain innovator biological products and a framework for FDA review and approval of biosimilar and interchangeable versions of innovator biologic products. The PPACA provides that no application for a biosimilar product may be approved until 12 years after the date on which the innovator product was first licensed, and no application may be submitted until four years after the date of the first licensure. Products deemed interchangeable (as opposed to biosimilar) are also eligible for certain exclusivity.
Governmental Regulation
The development, production and marketing of our proprietary and biologic products are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. In the U.S., drugs and biologics are subject to rigorous regulation. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended from time to time, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, promotion, and advertising of our products. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development, can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and to obtain FDA approval, a product must satisfy mandatory quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. In addition, each drug-manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA. Domestic manufacturing establishments must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations and are subject to inspections by the FDA. To supply drug ingredients or products for use in the U.S., foreign manufacturing establishments must also comply with cGMP and are subject to inspections by the FDA or by other regulatory authorities in certain countries under reciprocal agreements with the FDA.
General Information about the Drug Approval Process and Post-Marketing Requirements
The U.S. system of new drug and biologics approval is a rigorous process. Only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre-clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization. Our strategy focuses on in-licensing clinical stage drug products that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials. A late-stage focus helps us to effectively manage the high cost of drug development by focusing on compounds that have already passed the many hurdles in the pre-clinical and early clinical process.
The following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our proprietary products.
Pre-clinical Testing: During the pre-clinical testing stage, laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug or biologic compound against the targeted disease. The compound is evaluated for safety. While some of our compounds are currently in clinical trials, it is possible that additional pre-clinical testing could be requested by a regulatory authority for any of our compounds.
Investigational New Drug Application: After certain pre-clinical studies are completed, an IND application is submitted to the FDA to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug or biologic. An IND becomes effective thirty days after the FDA receives the application (unless the FDA notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold), or upon prior notification by the FDA.
Phase 1 Clinical Trials: These trials typically involve small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients and usually define a drug candidate’s safety profile, including the safe dosage range.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials: In Phase 2 clinical trials, controlled studies of human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug’s effectiveness. These studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels, dose schedules and route(s) of administration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic on humans, as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following Phase 1. These clinical trials, and Phase 3 trials discussed below, are designed to evaluate the product’s overall benefit-risk profile, and to provide information for physician labeling.
Phase 3 Clinical Trials: This Phase usually involves a larger number of patients with the targeted disease. Investigators (typically physicians) monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate’s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long-term use of the drug on a large, more widespread, patient population. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, typically the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease.
New Drug Application or Biologics License Application: After completion of all three clinical trial Phases, if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective, an NDA or BLA is filed with the FDA requesting FDA approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease.
Fast Track and Priority Review: The FDA has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious or life-threatening diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. 
Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”): An ANDA is an abbreviated new drug application for generic drugs created by the Hatch-Waxman Act. When a company files an ANDA, it must make a patent certification regarding the patents covering the branded product listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. The ANDA drug development process generally takes less time than the NDA drug development process since the ANDA process usually does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”): A BTD is available from the FDA for drugs or drug combinations used to treat serious or life-threatening disease conditions based on preliminary clinical evidence that the drug may offer substantial improvement over existing therapies. FDA may grant priority approval to breakthrough drug indications. FDA may also grant accelerated approval and priority review for drugs that fill an unmet medical need. An advantage to this designation is that clinical trials may use surrogate endpoints to predict clinical benefit, requiring less time than other objective endpoints such as overall survival. 
NDA/BLA and ANDA Approval: The FDA approves drugs and biologics that are subject to NDA and BLA review based on data in the application demonstrating the product is safe and effective in its proposed use(s) and that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks. The FDA will also review the NDA or BLA applicant’s manufacturing process and controls to ensure they 
are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. Finally, the FDA will review and approve the product’s proposed labeling. As for the ANDA approval process, these “abbreviated” applications are generally not required to include pre-clinical or clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Rather, an ANDA must demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio-equivalence (the rate and extent of absorption in the body) to the innovator drug — unless a bio-equivalence waiver is granted by the FDA.
Phase 4 Clinical Trials: After a drug has been approved by the FDA, Phase 4 studies may be conducted to explore additional patient populations, compare the drug to a competitor, or to further study the risks, benefits and optimal use of a drug. These studies may be a requirement as a condition of the initial approval of the NDA or BLA.
Post-Approval Studies Requirements under FDAAA: The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, significantly added to the FDA’s authority to require post-approval studies. Under the FDAAA, if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information after approval of a product, they may require us to conduct further clinical trials to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk. If required to conduct a post-approval study, periodic status reports must be submitted to the FDA. Failure to conduct such post-approval studies in a timely manner may result in administrative action being taken by FDA, including substantial civil fines.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Authority under FDAAA: The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product when necessary to minimize known and preventable safety risks associated with the product. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved, or after approval based on “new safety information,” including new analysis of existing safety information. A REMS may include a medication guide, patient package insert, a plan for communication with healthcare providers, or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product. A REMS must include a timetable for submission of assessments of the strategy at specified time intervals. Failure to comply with a REMS, including the submission of a required assessment, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties.
Other Issues Related to Product Safety: Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, under the FDAAA, the FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s life cycle based on new safety information derived from clinical trials, post-approval studies, peer-reviewed medical literature, or post-market risk identification and analysis systems data.
FDA Enforcement
The development of drug and biologic products, as well as the marketing of approved drugs and biologics, is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the FDA, including regulation of adverse event reporting, manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the product. Failure to comply with the FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs, BLAs, ANDAs or other product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. 
With respect specifically to information submitted to the FDA in support of marketing applications, the FDA, under its Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities Policy, can significantly delay the approval of a marketing application, or seek to withdraw an approved application where it identifies fraud or discrepancies in regulatory submissions. Such actions by the FDA may significantly delay or suspend substantive scientific review of a pending application during validity assessment or remove approved products from the market until the assessment is complete and questions regarding reliability of the data are resolved. In addition, the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992 (the “Generic Drug Enforcement Act”) established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an ANDA. Under the Generic Drug Enforcement Act, the FDA has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an ANDA, and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs. The FDA may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and/or withdraw approval of an ANDA and seek civil penalties.
Healthcare Reform
Continuing studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry, government agencies and others. Such studies, which increasingly employ sophisticated methods 
and techniques, can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of their marketing.
The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, or the Institute, a private, non-profit corporation created as a result of the PPACA, is tasked with assisting patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policy-makers in making informed health decisions. One of the Institute’s initiatives will be to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, which is defined as “research evaluating and comparing health outcomes and the clinical effectiveness, risks, and benefits of two or more medical treatments, services, and items.” It is important to note that the Institute would not be permitted to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer, however, the outcome of the Institute’s initiatives could influence prescriber behavior.
Foreign Regulation
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country/region to country/region, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also may vary, sometimes significantly, from country/region to country/region.
Under the EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized procedure or decentralized procedure or the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for medicines produced by a biotechnological process. The procedure is also mandatory for new active substances which are indicated for treatment of several diseases or conditions, including cancer and orphan conditions. Companies may apply for centralized assessment if the product contains a new active substance or the product constitutes significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or the granting of authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of the EU patients. A centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states. This marketing authorization is issued in the form of a European Commission decision which is legally binding in its entirety to which it is addressed.
Directive 2004/27/EC introduced two parallel procedures to the centralized procedure to allow a product to be progressively authorized in each of the member states of the EU. They are the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. The mutual recognition procedure applies where the product has already been authorized in a member state of the EU that will act as reference member state. The national marketing authorization granted by the reference member state forms the basis for mutual recognition in the member states chosen by the applicant. In the decentralized procedure, the product in question is not authorized in any one the EU member states. In such a situation, the applicant company will request a member state to act as the reference member state to lead the scientific assessment for the benefit/risk balance for agreement by the concerned member states. In both cases, the concerned member states have up to 90 days to accept or raise reasoned objections to the assessment made by the reference member state.
In addition, pricing and reimbursement is subject to negotiation and regulation in most countries outside the U.S. Increasingly, adoption of a new product for use in national health services is subject to health technology assessment under the national rules and regulations to establish the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new treatment. In some countries, in order to contain health care expenditures, reference price is introduced in order for the national healthcare providers to achieve a price comparable to the reference price in the same therapeutic category. We may therefore face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us.
Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
In the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It is time-consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking coverage from Medicare and private payers. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
The PPACA enacted significant reforms, including revising the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, increasing Medicaid rebates, expanding the 340B drug discount program, and making changes to affect the Medicare Part D coverage gap, or “donut hole.” In the coming years, additional significant changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs, and to the U.S. healthcare system as a whole, that may result in significantly increased demand for 
rebates, decreased pricing flexibility, diminished negotiating flexibility, coverage and reimbursement limitations based upon comparative and cost-effectiveness reviews, and other measures that could significantly impact the success of our products.
In many foreign markets, including the countries in the EU, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing controls or product coverage limitations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 146 employees (as compared to 235 employees as of December 31, 2018), 6 of whom hold an M.D. degree and 24 of whom hold a Ph.D. degree. Upon the closing of the Commercial Product Portfolio Transaction on March 1, 2019, we reduced our staff by 87 employees, the majority of which transitioned to Acrotech. 
We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain uniquely qualified personnel. Our employees are not part of any collective bargaining agreements and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
