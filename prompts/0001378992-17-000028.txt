General
 
Berry Global Group, Inc. ("Berry," "we," or the "Company") is a leading provider of value-added engineered materials, nonwoven specialty materials and consumer packaging with a track record of delivering high-quality customized solutions to our customers.  We sell our products predominantly into stable, consumer-oriented end-markets, such as healthcare, personal care, and food and beverage.  Our customers consist of a diverse mix of leading global, national, mid-sized regional and local specialty businesses.  The size and scope of our customer network allows us to introduce new products we develop or acquire to a vast audience that is familiar with our business.  In fiscal 2017, no single customer represented more than 5% of net sales and our top ten customers represented 16% of net sales.  We believe our manufacturing processes and our ability to leverage our scale to reduce expenses positions us as a low-cost manufacturer relative to our competitors.
 
Effective April 2017, the Company changed its name from Berry Plastics Group, Inc. to Berry Global Group, Inc.  The new name is reflected throughout this Form 10-K.  Common Shares of the Company stock continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BERY.  In addition, Berry Plastics Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary, changed its name to Berry Global, Inc.
 
Additional financial information about our business segments is provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
 
Recent Developments
 
Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc.
 
In November 2017, the Company entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. ("Clopay") for a purchase price of approximately $475 million which is preliminary and subject to adjustment, and is intended to be funded with existing liquidity or an additional debt offering.  Clopay manufactures printed breathable films and is an innovator in the development of elastic films and laminates with product offerings uniquely designed for applications used in a number of markets including: hygiene, healthcare, construction and industrial protective apparel.  Clopay reported $461 million in sales for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and will be operated within the Health, Hygiene and Specialties segment upon completion of the transaction.  The completion of the Clopay acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions and the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement.  The Company expects to realize annual cost synergies of approximately $20 million from the completion of the Clopay transaction.
Euro Swap
 
In November 2017, the Company entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements with a notional amount of 250 million euro to effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate USD denominated term loans, including the monthly interest payments, to fixed rate euro-denominated debt.  The swap agreements mature May 2022.  The risk management objective is to manage foreign currency risk relating to net investments in subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies and reduce the variability in the functional currency cash flows of a portion of the Company's term loans.

Marketing, Sales, and Competition
 
We reach our large and diversified customer base through a direct sales force of dedicated professionals and the strategic use of distributors.  Our sales, production and support staff meet with customers to understand their needs and improve our product offerings and services.  Our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products or customers, when applicable, which enables us to develop expertise that we believe is valued by our customers.  In addition, because we serve common customers across segments, we have the ability to efficiently utilize our sales and marketing resources to minimize costs.
 
The major markets in which the Company sells its products are highly competitive.  Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price.  This competition is significant as to both the size and the number of competing firms.  Competitors include but are not limited to Silgan, Aptar, Reynolds, Intertape, 3M, Tredegar, Bemis, Avgol, and Fitesa.
 
Research, Product Development and Design
 
We believe our technology base and research and development support are among the best in the industries we serve.  Many of our customers work in partnership with our technical representatives to develop new, more competitive products.  Our design professionals work directly with our customers to develop new styles and use computer-generated graphics to enable our customers to visualize the finished product.  Expenditures for research and development activities were $45 million, $48 million, and $33 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Raw Materials
 
Our primary raw material is plastic resin.  In addition, we use other materials such as butyl rubber, adhesives, paper and packaging materials, linerboard, rayon, polyester fiber, and foil, in various manufacturing processes.  These raw materials are available from multiple sources and in general we purchase from a variety of global suppliers.  However, in certain regions we may source specific raw materials from a limited number of suppliers or on a sole-source basis.  While temporary shortages of raw materials can occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions.
Employees
 
As of the end of fiscal year 2017, we employed approximately 23,000 employees with approximately 20% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of these employees renew annually and as a result, are due for renegotiation in fiscal 2018.  Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We customarily seek patent and trademark protection for our products and brands while seeking to protect our proprietary know-how.  While important to our business in the aggregate, sales of any one individually patented product are not considered material to any specific segment or the consolidated results.
Environmental Matters and Government Regulation
 
Our past and present operations and our past and present ownership and operations of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, we cannot predict with any certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations, contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material.
 
We may from time to time be required to conduct remediation of releases of regulated materials at our owned or operated facilities. None of our pending remediation projects are expected to result in material costs. Like any manufacturer, we are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended ("CERCLA"), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party. We are not aware that any such notices are currently pending which are expected to result in material costs.

The Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulates the material content of direct-contact food and drug packages, including certain packages we manufacture pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Certain of our products are also regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Both the FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which we sell our products. In addition, laws exist in certain states restricting the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals, imposing fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although we believe that we use FDA approved resins and pigments in our products that directly contact food and drug products, and we believe our products are in material compliance with all applicable requirements, we remain subject to the risk that our products could be found not to be in compliance with such requirements.
 
The plastics industry, including us, is subject to existing and potential federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid waste by requiring, among other things, plastics to be degradable in landfills, minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees, and limits on the use of plastic products. In particular, certain states have enacted legislation requiring products packaged in plastic containers to comply with standards intended to encourage recycling and increased use of recycled materials. In addition, various consumer and special interest groups have lobbied from time to time for the implementation of these and other similar measures. We believe that the legislation promulgated to date and such initiatives to date have not had a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that any such future legislative or regulatory efforts or future initiatives would not have a material adverse effect on us.
