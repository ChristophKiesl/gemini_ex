Item 1. Business
General
Group 1 Automotive, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1995, is a leading operator in the automotive retail industry. As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 210 franchises, representing 31 brands of automobiles, at 159 dealership locations and 38 collision centers worldwide. We own 146 franchises at 111 dealership locations and 29 collision service centers in the United States of America (“U.S.”), 41 franchises at 30 dealership locations and eight collision centers in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and 23 franchises at 18 dealership locations and one collision center in Brazil. Through our dealerships, we sell new and used cars and light trucks; arrange related vehicle financing; sell service and insurance contracts; provide automotive maintenance and repair services; and sell vehicle parts. Our operations are primarily located in major metropolitan areas in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas in the U.S., in 20 towns in the U.K., and in key metropolitan markets in the states of Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso do Sul and Santa Catarina in Brazil.
As discussed in more detail in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates,” all of our operating subsidiaries are aligned into one of four operating segments (or regions). As of December 31, 2016, our U.S. retail network consisted of the following two regions (with the number of dealerships they comprised): (a) the East (36 dealerships in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina) and (b) the West (75 dealerships in California, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas). Each U.S. region is managed by a regional vice president who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for the overall performance of their region. The operations of the Company’s international regions are structured similarly to the U.S. regions, each with a regional vice president reporting directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The financial matters of each U.S. region are managed by a regional chief financial officer who reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer. Our two international regions are also managed locally with direct reporting responsibilities to our corporate management team. Our financial information, including our revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes beginning on page F-1.
Business Strategy
We believe that we have developed a distinguished management team with substantial industry expertise. Our business strategy is to leverage what we believe to be one of our key strengths — the talent of our people — to: (a) sell new and used cars and light trucks; (b) arrange related vehicle financing, service and insurance contracts; (c) provide automotive maintenance and repair services; and (d) sell vehicle parts via an expanding network of franchised dealerships located primarily in growing regions of the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. With our management structure and level of executive talent, we plan to continue empowering the operators of our dealerships to make appropriate decisions to grow their respective dealership operations and to control fixed and variable costs. We believe this approach allows us to provide the best possible service to our customers, as well as attract and retain talented employees.
We continue to primarily focus on the performance of our existing dealerships to achieve growth, capture market share, and maximize the investment return to our stockholders. For 2017, we will primarily focus on four key areas as we continue to become a best-in-class automotive retailer. These areas are:

• | sustained growth of our higher margin parts and service business;


• | improvement of new and used vehicle retail margins, as well as total new and used vehicle retail profitability;


• | promotion of the customer experience and customer satisfaction;


• | improvement of operating efficiencies through further development of our operating model that promotes commonality of processes, systems and training and further leveraging of our cost base.

Our focus on growth in our parts and service operations continues to hinge on targeted marketing efforts, strategic selling and operational efficiencies, as well as capital investments designed to support our growth targets. In our new and used retail vehicle operations, our efforts are centered on the efficient and effective use of technology and advertising to enhance our sales efforts. We intend to make resource investments that are focused on the customer experience and customer satisfaction in all areas of our business. We made significant changes in our operating model during the last five years, which were designed to reduce variable and fixed expenses, appropriately leverage our scale and generate operating efficiencies. As our business grows in 2017 and beyond, we intend to manage our costs carefully and to look for additional opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our processes and disseminate best practices. We believe that our management structure supports more rapid decision making and facilitates an efficient and effective roll-out of new processes.

We continue our efforts to fully leverage our scale, reduce costs, enhance internal controls, and enable further growth and, as such, we are taking steps to standardize key operating processes. We are constantly evaluating opportunities to improve the profitability of our dealerships. 
We will continue to focus on opportunities for enhancement of our current dealership portfolio by strategic acquisitions and improving or disposing of underperforming dealerships in the U.S., the U.K. and Brazil. We believe that substantial opportunities for growth through acquisitions remain in our industry. An absolute acquisition target has not been established for 2017, but we expect to acquire dealerships that provide attractive returns on investment. We believe that as of December 31, 2016, we have sufficient financial resources to support additional acquisitions. We plan to focus our growth in geographically diverse areas with positive economic outlooks over the longer-term. Further, we intend to critically evaluate our return on invested capital in our current dealership portfolio for disposition opportunities. In 2016, we completed the acquisition of 12 U.K. dealerships, inclusive of 15 franchises, and opened two additional dealerships for two awarded franchises in the U.K., with expected aggregate annualized revenues, estimated at the time of acquisition, of $640.0 million. In addition, we completed the acquisition of one dealership in Brazil, representing one franchise, and opened two dealerships for one acquired and two previously awarded franchises, with expected aggregate annualized revenues, estimated at the time of acquisition, of $20.0 million. For more information on our acquisitions and dispositions, including those occurring in 2016, see “Acquisition and Divestiture Program” below.

Dealership Operations
Our operations are located in geographically diverse markets that extend domestically across 14 states aggregated into two U.S. regions, East and West, and internationally in the U.K. and Brazil. We consolidated four regions into three reportable segments; U.S., U.K. and Brazil. By reportable segment, our revenues from external customers for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $8,734.7 million, $8,894.0 million, and $8,175.2 million from our U.S. operations, respectively, and $1,723.2 million, $1,220.2 million, and $987.3 million from our U.K. operations, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our revenues from external customers from our Brazil operations were $429.8 million, $518.3 million, and $775.4 million, respectively. Net income by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $139.6 million, $142.4 million, and $97.2 million from our U.S. operations, respectively, and $14.4 million, $15.2 million, and $14.3 million from our U.K. operations, respectively. In our Brazil operations, we realized a net loss of $7.0 million, $63.6 million, and $18.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our aggregate long-lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets and financial instruments in our U.S. operations were $997.7 million, $922.2 million, and $846.4 million, respectively, and in our U.K. operations were $120.9 million, $107.6 million, and $100.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our long-lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets and financial instruments in our Brazil operations were $19.3 million, $15.9 million, and $22.1 million, respectively. For a discussion of the risks associated with our operations in the U.K. and Brazil, please see Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” The following table sets forth the regions and geographic markets in which we operate, the percentage of new vehicle retail units sold in each region in 2016 and the number of dealerships and franchises in each region:

Each of our local operations has a management structure designed to promote and reward entrepreneurial spirit and the achievement of team goals. The general manager of each dealership, with assistance from the managers of new vehicle sales, used vehicle sales, parts, service, and finance and insurance departments, is ultimately responsible for the operation, personnel and financial performance of the dealership. Our dealerships are operated as distinct profit centers, and our general managers have a reasonable degree of empowerment within our organization. In the U.S., each general manager reports to one of our market directors or one of two regional vice presidents. Our U.S. regional vice presidents report directly to our Chief Executive Officer and are responsible for the overall performance of their regions, as well as for overseeing the market directors and dealership general managers that report to them. Our U.K. and Brazil operations are structured similarly, with a regional vice president reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

New Vehicle Retail Sales
In 2016, we sold or leased 172,053 new vehicles in retail transactions at our dealerships, representing 34 brands. Our retail sales of new vehicles accounted for 19.8% of our gross profit in 2016. In addition to the profit related to the transactions, a typical new vehicle retail sale or lease may create the following additional profit opportunities for our dealerships:

• | manufacturer dealer incentives;


• | the resale of any used vehicle trade-in purchased by the dealership;


• | arrangement of third-party financing in connection with the retail sale;


• | the sale of vehicle service and insurance contracts in connection with the retail sale;


• | the sale of vehicle parts, accessories or other after-market products; and


• | the service and repair of the vehicle both during and after the warranty period.

Our new vehicle unit sales mix was affected by our acquisitions and dispositions during 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
Some new vehicles we sell are purchased by customers under lease or lease-type financing arrangements with third-party lenders. New vehicle leases generally have shorter terms, bringing the customer back to the vehicle market, and our dealerships specifically, sooner than if the vehicle purchase was debt financed. In addition, lease or lease-type customer financing arrangements provide our dealerships with a steady supply of late-model, off-lease vehicles to be sold as used vehicles. Generally, leased vehicles remain under factory warranty, allowing the opportunity for our dealerships to provide maintenance and repair services for the contract term. However, the penetration rate for other finance and insurance product sales on leases and lease-type customer financing arrangements tends to be less than in other financing arrangements (such as debt financed vehicles). We typically do not guarantee residual values on lease transactions. Lease vehicle unit sales represented 16.7%, 16.5% and 15.1% of our total new vehicle retail unit sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Used Vehicle Sales, Retail and Wholesale
We sell used vehicles at each of our franchised dealerships. In 2016, we sold or lease-financed 129,131 used vehicles at our dealerships, and sold 57,339 used vehicles in wholesale markets. Our retail sales of used vehicles accounted for 11.2% of our gross profit in 2016. Used vehicles sold or lease-financed at retail typically generate higher gross margins on a percentage basis than new vehicles primarily because of their relatively limited comparability, which is dependent on a vehicle’s age, mileage and condition, among other things. 
Valuations of used vehicles vary based on supply and demand factors, the level of new vehicle incentives, and the availability of retail financing and general economic conditions. Profit from the sale of used vehicles depends primarily on a dealership’s ability to obtain a high-quality supply of used vehicles at reasonable prices and to effectively manage that inventory. Our new vehicle operations generally provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high-quality trade-ins and off-lease vehicles, and are the best source of high-quality used vehicles. Our dealerships supplement their used vehicle inventory with purchases at auctions, including manufacturer-sponsored auctions available only to franchised dealers. We continue to extensively utilize a common used vehicle management software tool in all of our U.S. dealerships with the goal to enhance the management of used vehicle inventory, focusing on the more profitable retail used vehicle business and reducing our wholesale used vehicle business. This internet-based software tool is an integral part of our used vehicle process, enabling our managers to make used vehicle inventory decisions based on real time market valuation data. It also allows us to leverage our size and local market presence by expanding the pool from which used vehicles can be sold within a given market or region within the U.S., effectively broadening the demand for our used vehicle inventory. In addition, this software supports increased oversight of our assets in inventory, allowing us to better control our exposure to declines in used vehicles market valuations, the values of which typically occur over time.
In addition to active management of the quality and age of our used vehicle inventory, we are focused on increasing the total lifecycle profitability of our used vehicle operations by participating in manufacturer certification programs where available. Manufacturer certified pre-owned (“CPO”) vehicles offer customers in the U.S. and U.K. the opportunity to purchase a used vehicle that has passed a rigorous array of manufacturer-defined tests, and that are eligible for manufacturer support, 
7

such as subsidized finance rates, the extension of manufacturer’s service warranty and other benefits. With the extended service warranty, the sale of CPO vehicles tends to generate better ongoing customer loyalty for maintenance and repair services at the selling dealership. CPO vehicles typically cost more to recondition, but sell at a premium compared to other used vehicles and are available only from franchised new vehicle dealerships. Our CPO vehicle sales in the U.S. and U.K. represented 27.2% of total U.S and U.K. used retail sales in 2016. CPO vehicles are not yet available in Brazil.
Parts and Service Sales
We sell replacement parts and provide maintenance and repair services at each of our franchised dealerships and provide collision repair services at the 38 collision centers that we operate. Our parts and service business accounted for 42.6% of our gross profit in 2016. We perform both warranty and non-warranty service work at our dealerships, primarily for the vehicle brand(s) sold at a particular location. Warranty, customer pay, collision business and wholesale accounted for 20.4%, 44.9%, 14.2% and 20.5%, respectively, of the revenues from our parts and service business in 2016. Our parts and service departments also perform used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle enhancement services for which they realize a profit. However, the revenue for that internal work is eliminated from our parts and service revenue in the consolidation of our financial statements.
The automotive repair industry is highly fragmented, with a significant number of independent maintenance and repair facilities in addition to those of the franchised dealerships. We believe, however, that the increasing complexity of new vehicles, especially in the area of electronics, is making it difficult for many independent repair shops to retain the expertise necessary to perform major or technical repairs. We have made investments in recruiting, training, and retaining qualified technicians to work in our service and repair facilities. And, we have made investments in state of the art diagnostic and repair equipment to be utilized by these technicians. 
Manufacturers only permit warranty and recall work to be performed at franchised dealerships. Currently, a trend exists in the automobile industry towards longer new vehicle warranty periods and more diligence with manufacturer recalls. As a result, we believe that over time an increasing percentage of all repair work will be performed at franchised dealerships that have the sophisticated equipment and skilled personnel necessary to perform repairs and warranty work on today’s complex vehicles.
Our strategy to capture an increasing share of the parts and service work performed by franchised dealerships and enhance profitability includes the following elements:

• | Focus on Customer Relationships; Emphasize Preventative Maintenance. Our dealerships seek to retain customers of our new and used vehicles as ongoing clients of our parts and service departments. To accomplish this goal, we use computer systems that track the vehicle owners’ maintenance records and provide advance notice to them when their vehicles are due for periodic service. Our use of computer-based customer relationship management tools increases the reach and effectiveness of our marketing efforts, allowing us to target our promotional offerings to areas in which service capacity is under-utilized or profit margins are greatest. We continue to train our service personnel to establish relationships with their service clients to promote a long-term business relationship. And, we are focused on enhancing access to our service facilities by providing patrons with readily-accessible means to schedule service appointments. We believe our parts and service activities are an integral part of the customer service experience, allowing us to maintain ongoing relationships with our dealerships’ clients thereby deepening customer loyalty to the dealership as a whole. 


• | Sell Vehicle Service Contracts in Conjunction with Vehicle Sales. Our finance and insurance sales departments attempt to connect new and used vehicle customers with vehicle service contracts, and thereby secure repeat customer business for our parts and service departments. 


• | Efficient Management of Parts Inventory. Our dealerships’ parts departments support their vehicle sales and service departments, selling factory-approved parts for the respective vehicle makes and models. Parts are either used in repairs made in the service department, sold at retail to customers, or sold at wholesale to independent repair shops and other franchised dealerships. Our dealerships also frequently share parts with each other. Our dealerships employ parts managers who oversee parts inventories and sales. Software programs are used to monitor parts inventory, maximize sales, avoid obsolete and unused parts, and make the best use of manufacturer return procedures. 


• | Expansion of Collision Center Operations. We plan to continue to grow our collision center operations. Expansion in this segment of the business is not restricted by franchise agreements or manufacturer relationships. We believe that our concentration of dealership operations in certain of the markets in which we operate significantly enhances the profit model opportunities for our collision center operations. 

Finance and Insurance Sales
Revenues from our finance and insurance operations consist primarily of fees for arranging financing and selling vehicle service and insurance contracts in connection with the retail purchase of a new or used vehicle. Our finance and insurance 
8

business accounted for 26.4% of our gross profit in 2016. We offer a wide variety of third-party finance, vehicle service and insurance products in a convenient manner and at competitive prices. To increase transparency to our customers, we offer all of our products on menus that display pricing and other information, allowing customers to choose the products that suit their needs.
Financing.   We arrange third-party purchase and lease financing for our customers. In return, we receive a fee from the third-party finance company upon completion of the financing. These third-party finance companies include manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries, selected commercial banks and a variety of other third-parties, including credit unions and regional auto finance companies. Generally, we do not retain substantial credit risk after a customer has received financing. The fees we receive from the third-party finance companies are subject to chargeback, or repayment, to the finance company, if a customer defaults or prepays the financing contract, typically during some limited time period at the beginning of the contract term. We have negotiated incentive programs with some finance companies pursuant to which we receive additional fees upon reaching a certain volume of business. 
Extended Warranty, Vehicle Service and Insurance Products.   We offer our customers a variety of vehicle warranty and extended protection products in connection with purchases of new and used vehicles, including:

• | extended warranties;


• | maintenance, or vehicle service, products and programs;


• | guaranteed asset protection insurance, which covers the shortfall between a customer’s contract balance and insurance payoff in the event of a total vehicle loss; and


• | lease “wear and tear” insurance.

The products our dealerships offer are generally underwritten and administered by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers’ captive finance subsidiaries. Under our arrangements with the providers of these products, we either sell these products on a straight commission basis, or we sell the product, recognize commission and participate in future underwriting profit, if any, pursuant to a retrospective commission arrangement. These commissions may be subject to chargeback, in full or in part, if the contract is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity.
New and Used Vehicle Inventory Financing
Our dealerships finance their inventory purchases through the Floorplan Line (defined below) of our Revolving Credit Facility (defined below), separate floorplan credit facility arrangements with manufacturers and other third-party financial institutions in the U.S., U.K. and Brazil. Our revolving syndicated credit facility matures in June 2021 and provides a total borrowing capacity of $1.8 billion, (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility consists of two tranches: a maximum of $1.75 billion for vehicle inventory financing (“Floorplan Line”), as well as a maximum of $360.0 million and a minimum of $50.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions (“Acquisition Line”). We utilize our Floorplan Line to finance up to 85% of the value of our used vehicle inventory in the U.S., and up to 100% of the value of all new vehicle inventory in the U.S., other than new vehicles purchased from Ford. The capacity under these two tranches can be re-designated within the overall $1.8 billion commitment, subject to the aforementioned limits. However, the amount of available borrowing capacity under the Acquisition Line is limited from time to time based upon certain debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. We can expand the Revolving Credit Facility to its maximum commitment of $2.1 billion, subject to participating lender approval.
We have a floorplan arrangement with Ford Motor Credit Company (“FMCC”) that provides $300.0 million of floorplan financing capacity (“FMCC Facility”). We use the funds available under this arrangement to exclusively finance our U.S. inventories of new Ford vehicles sold by the lender’s manufacturer affiliate. The FMCC Facility is an evergreen arrangement that may be canceled with 30 days’ notice by either party. Should the FMCC Facility no longer be available to us for financing of our new U.S. Ford inventory, we could utilize the available capacity under our Floorplan Line to finance our new Ford vehicle inventory. 
In addition, we finance certain rental vehicles in the U.S. through separate arrangements with the respective automobile manufacturers. We also utilize credit facilities with BMW Financial Services, Volkswagen Finance, FMCC and a third-party financial institution for the financing of new, used, and rental vehicle inventories associated with our U.K. operations. 
In addition, we have credit facilities with financial institutions in Brazil, most of which are affiliated with the manufacturers, for the financing of new, used and rental vehicle inventories related to our Brazil operations. These facilities may be canceled with notice by either party and bear interest at a benchmark rate, plus a surcharge that varies based upon the type of vehicle being financed.

Acquisition and Divestiture Program
We pursue an acquisition and divestiture program focused on delivering an attractive return on investment.
Acquisition Strategy.   We seek to acquire large, profitable, well-established dealerships and franchises that are leaders in their markets to:

• | enhance brand and geographic diversity with primary focus on import and luxury brands;


• | expand into geographic areas we currently do not serve;


• | expand our brand, product, and service offerings in our existing markets;


• | capitalize on economies of scale in our existing markets; and/or


• | increase operating efficiency and cost savings in areas such as used vehicle sourcing, advertising, purchasing, data processing, personnel utilization, and the cost of floorplan financing.

We typically pursue dealerships with superior operational management, whom we seek to retain. By retaining existing personnel who have experience and in-depth knowledge of their local market, we believe that we can mitigate the risks involved with employing and training new and untested personnel. In addition, our acquisition strategy targets the purchase of the related real estate to provide maximum operating flexibility.
We focus on the acquisition of dealerships or groups of dealerships that we believe offer opportunities for higher returns, and particularly on brands which provide growth opportunities for our parts and service operations and strengthen our operations in geographic regions in which we currently operate with attractive long-term economic prospects.
Recent Acquisitions. In 2016, we acquired 12 U.K. dealerships, inclusive of 15 franchises and opened two additional dealerships for two awarded franchises in our U.K. segment. We also acquired one dealership in Brazil, representing one franchise, and opened two additional dealerships in Brazil representing one acquired and two previously awarded franchises. The expected aggregate annualized revenues, estimated at the time of acquisition, for these acquisitions, were $660.0 million. 
Divestiture Strategy.   We continually review the investments in our dealership portfolio for disposition opportunities, based upon a number of criteria, including:

• | the rate of return on our capital investment over a period of time;


• | location of the dealership in relation to existing markets and our ability to leverage our cost structure;


• | potential future capital investment requirements;


• | the brand; and


• | existing real estate obligations, coupled with our ability to exit those obligations or identify an alternate use for real estate.

While it is our desire to only acquire profitable, well-established dealerships, we have at times, acquired dealerships that do not fit our acquisition strategy in connection with the acquisition of a larger dealership group. We acquire such dealerships with the understanding that we may need to divest some or all of them at some future time. The costs associated with such potential divestitures are included in our analysis of whether we acquire all dealerships in the same acquisition. Additionally, we may acquire a dealership whose profitability is marginal, but which we believe can be increased through various factors, such as: (a) change in management, (b) expansion or improvement in facility operations, (c) relocation of facility based on demographic changes, (d) reduction in costs, and/or (e) sales training. If, after a period of time, a dealership’s profitability does not positively respond, we will seek to sell the dealership to a third party, or, in a rare case, surrender the franchise back to the manufacturer. In conjunction with the disposition of certain of our dealerships, we may also dispose of the associated real estate. Management constantly monitors the performance of all of our dealerships, and routinely assesses the need for divestiture. In connection with divestitures, we are sometimes required to incur additional charges associated with lease terminations or the impairment of long-lived and/or intangible, indefinite-lived assets. We continue to rationalize our dealership portfolio and focus on increasing the overall profitability of our operations. 
Recent Dispositions.   During 2016, we disposed of five U.S dealerships, four dealerships in Brazil and one dealership in the U.K., with annualized revenues of approximately $240.0 million.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry. In each of our markets, consumers have a number of choices when deciding where to purchase a new or used vehicle and how the purchase will be financed. Consumers also have options for the purchase of related parts and accessories, as well as the maintenance service and repair of vehicles. In the U.S., according to The 
10

National Automobile Dealers Association, there were approximately 16,545 franchised automobile dealerships as of January 1, 2016, which was up from 16,396 as of January 1, 2015. In the U.K., according to the National Franchised Dealers Association, there were approximately 4,065 franchised dealerships as of January 1, 2016, which was down from 4,127 as of January 1, 2015. In Brazil, according to The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers, there were approximately 4,389 franchised automobile dealerships as of January 1, 2015, which was up from 4,364 as of January 1, 2014. 
Our competitive success depends, in part, on national and regional automobile-buying trends, local and regional economic factors, and other regional competitive pressures. Conditions and competitive pressures affecting the markets in which we operate, or in any new markets we enter, could adversely affect us, although the retail automobile industry as a whole might not be affected. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and personnel resources, and lower overhead and sales costs than we do. We cannot guarantee that our operating performance and our acquisition or disposition strategies will be more effective than the strategies of our competitors.
New and Used Vehicles.   We believe the principal competitive factors in the automotive retailing business are location, suitability of the facility, on-site management, the acceptance of a franchise to the market in which it is located, concentration of same franchises in the surrounding markets, service, price, and selection. In the new vehicle market, our dealerships compete with other franchised dealerships in their market areas, as well as auto brokers, leasing companies, and internet companies that provide referrals to, or broker vehicle sales with, other dealerships or customers. We are subject to competition from dealers that sell the same brands of new vehicles that we sell and from dealers that sell other brands of new vehicles that we do not sell in a particular market. Our new vehicle dealer competitors also have franchise agreements with the various vehicle manufacturers and, as such, generally have access to new vehicles on the same terms as we do. We do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from vehicle manufacturers, and our franchise agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer’s product within a given geographic area.
In the used vehicle market, our dealerships compete both in their local market and nationally, including over the internet, with other franchised dealers, large multi-location used vehicle retailers, local independent used vehicle dealers, automobile rental agencies, and private parties for the supply and resale of used vehicles.
Parts, Service and Collision Businesses.   We believe the principal competitive factors in the parts and service business are the quality of customer service, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, familiarity with a manufacturer’s brands and models, accessibility and convenience, access to and use of technology required for certain repairs and services (e.g., software patches, diagnostic equipment, etc.), location, price, the competence of technicians, and the availability of training programs to enhance such expertise. In the parts and service market, our dealerships compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty maintenance and repairs, conduct manufacturer recall services and sell factory replacement parts. Our dealerships also compete with other automobile dealers, franchised and independent service center chains, and independent repair shops for non-warranty repair and maintenance business. In addition, our dealerships sell replacement and aftermarket parts both locally and nationally over the internet in competition with franchised and independent retail and wholesale parts outlets. A number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than ours. Our collision centers compete with other large, multi-location companies, as well as local, independent, collision service operations.
Finance and Insurance. We believe the principal competitive factors in the finance and insurance business are convenience, interest rates, product availability, product knowledge and flexibility in contract length, further increasing the competition for customer financing. We face competition in arranging financing for our customers’ vehicle purchases from a broad range of financial institutions. Many financial institutions now offer finance and insurance products over the internet, which may reduce our profits from the sale of these products. We may be charged back for unearned financing, insurance contracts or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers.
Acquisitions.   We compete with other national dealer groups and individual investors for acquisitions. Increased competition, especially for certain luxury and import brands, may raise the cost of acquisitions. In the future, we cannot guarantee that there will be opportunities to complete acquisitions, nor are we able to guarantee that we will be able to complete acquisitions on terms acceptable to us.
Financing Arrangements and Indebtedness
As of December 31, 2016, our outstanding indebtedness, coupled with lease and other obligations totaled $3,593.6 million, including the following:

• | $1,072.1 million under the Floorplan Line of our Revolving Credit Facility;


• | $540.5 million in carrying value of 5.00% senior notes due 2022 (“5.00% Notes”);


• | $394.5 million of future commitments under various operating leases;

11


• | $327.3 million of estimated future interest payments on existing floorplan notes payable and other long-term debt obligations;


• | $321.9 million of mortgage term loans in the U.S., entered into independently with three of our manufacturer-affiliated finance partners, Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (“TMCC”), BMWFS, and FMCC, as well as several third-party financial institutions, primarily to finance the purchase of real estate;


• | $295.6 million in carrying value of 5.25% senior notes due 2023 (“5.25% Notes”);


• | $222.4 million under floorplan notes payable to various manufacturer affiliates and third-party financial institutions for foreign and rental vehicles;


• | $149.7 million under our FMCC Facility;


• | $50.4 million of mortgage term loans in the U.K. (collectively, “U.K. Notes”);


• | $47.6 million of capital lease obligations related to real estate, as well as $30.8 million of estimated interest;


• | $42.6 million of other short and long-term purchase commitments;


• | $37.1 million of letters of credit, to collateralize certain obligations, issued under the Acquisition Line;


• | $31.9 million of estimated future net obligations from interest rate risk management activities; as of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of such obligations was $24.4 million; and


• | $29.2 million of various other debt and other capital lease obligations;

As of December 31, 2016, we had the following amounts available for additional borrowings under our various U.S. credit facilities:

• | $367.9 million under the Floorplan Line of our Revolving Credit Facility, including $59.6 million of immediately available funds;


• | $322.9 million under the Acquisition Line of our Revolving Credit Facility, which is limited based upon a borrowing base calculation within certain debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility; and


• | $150.2 million under our FMCC Facility, including $25.5 million of immediately available funds.

In addition, the indentures relating to our other debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness and enter into additional operating leases, subject to certain conditions.
For additional information regarding our financing arrangements and indebtedness, please read Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Stock Repurchase Program
From time to time, our Board of Directors gives authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to the restrictions of various debt agreements and our judgment. We are limited under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, certain mortgage term loans, 5.00% Notes and 5.25% Notes in our ability to make restricted payments, such as repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock and make payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, among other things. As of December 31, 2016, the restricted payment baskets limited us to $132.3 million in restricted payments. Generally, these restricted payment baskets will increase in the future periods by 50.0% of our future cumulative net income, adjusted to exclude the Company’s foreign operations, non-cash interest expense, non-cash asset impairment charges, and non-cash stock-based compensation, plus the net proceeds received from the sale of our capital stock, and decrease by the amount of future payments for cash dividends and share repurchases.
In February 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $150.0 million, replacing the authorization remaining at that time. Under the authorizations, we repurchased 2,282,579 shares during 2016 at an average price of $55.90 per share, for a total of $127.6 million, leaving $22.4 million available for future repurchases as of December 31, 2016. Future repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors after considering our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, existing debt covenants, outlook for our business, general business conditions and other factors. 
Dividends
During 2016, our Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends. The first dividend was approved and paid at $0.22 per share, the second, third and fourth were increased to $0.23 per share for a total of $0.91 per share, or $20.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, after considering our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, outlook for our 
12

business, general business conditions, the political and legislative environments, and other factors. As noted above, we are also limited in our ability to make cash dividend payments to our stockholders under the terms of several of our debt financing arrangements. 
Relationships and Agreements with our Manufacturers
Each of our U.S. dealerships operates under one or more franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers (or authorized distributors). The franchise agreements grant the franchised automobile dealership a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s or distributor’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area. These franchise agreements also grant franchised dealerships the right to use the manufacturer’s or distributor’s trademarks in connection with their operations, and impose numerous operational requirements and restrictions relating to, among other things:

• | inventory levels;


• | working capital levels;


• | the sales process;


• | minimum sales performance requirements;


• | customer satisfaction standards;


• | marketing and branding;


• | facility standards and signage;


• | personnel;


• | changes in management;


• | change in control; and


• | monthly financial reporting.

Our dealerships’ franchise agreements are for various terms, ranging from one year to indefinite. Each of our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by the manufacturer for a variety of reasons, including unapproved changes of ownership or management and performance deficiencies in such areas as sales volume, sales effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. In most cases, manufacturers have renewed the franchises upon expiration so long as the dealership is in compliance with the terms of the agreement. From time to time, certain manufacturers may assert sales and customer satisfaction performance deficiencies under the terms of our framework and franchise agreements. We work with these manufacturers to address any performance issues. 
In general, the U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide that, notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement, it is unlawful for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise unless “good cause” exists. It generally is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate, or not renew, a franchise under these laws, which were designed to protect dealers. Though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers’ lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of dealer laws. If dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate in the U.S., manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or showing of good cause. Without the protection of dealer laws, it may also be more difficult for our dealers to renew their franchise agreements upon expiration. Further, U.S. federal law, including any federal bankruptcy law, may preempt U.S. state law and allow manufacturers greater freedom to terminate or not renew franchises.
The U.K. generally does not have automotive dealership franchise laws and, as a result, our U.K. dealerships operate without these types of specific protections. However, similar protections may be available as a matter of general U.K. contractual law. In addition, our U.K. dealerships are subject to European Union (“EU”) and U.K. antitrust rules prohibiting certain restrictions on the sale of new vehicles and spare parts and on the provision of repairs and maintenance across the EU. For example, authorized dealers are generally able to, subject to manufacturer facility requirements, relocate or add additional facilities throughout the EU, offer multiple brands in the same facility, allow the operation of service facilities independent of new car sales facilities and ease restrictions on cross supplies (including on transfers of dealerships) between existing authorized dealers within the EU. However, certain restrictions on dealerships may be permissible provided the conditions set out in the relevant EU Block Exemption Regulations are met. On June 23, 2016, the British Citizens voted on a referendum in favor of exiting the E.U. The majority vote in favor of Brexit has created uncertainty in the global markets and in the regulatory environment in the U.K., as well as the overall European Union. The impact on our financial results and operations may not be known for some time, but could be adverse. In addition, automotive dealers in the U.K. rely on the legislative doctrine of Block 
13

Exemption to govern market representation activities of competing dealers and dealer groups. To date, there has been no clear indication of how such legislation may be effected by Brexit, but a change to such legislation could be adverse. 
The sale of vehicles in Brazil is regulated by federal law, commonly referred to in Brazil as the Ferrari Law. Such law sets forth the terms and conditions of distribution agreements executed among manufacturers and dealerships, specifically with regard to the distribution of cars, trucks, buses, tractors, motorbikes and similar vehicles. In addition, the Ferrari Law establishes the geographical area of a dealership, termination of distribution agreements and their consequences, among other things. Any contractual provision that conflicts with the Ferrari Law is considered void in Brazil. The distribution agreements contemplate the commercialization of vehicles and components fabricated by the manufacturer, the rendering of technical assistance relating to such products and the usage by the dealerships of the manufacturers’ brand. According to the Ferrari Law, distribution agreements may be executed for either a determined or an undetermined term. In the case of a distribution agreement executed for a determined term, its initial term may not be less than 5 years. At the end of this initial 5 year term, such distribution agreement will be automatically converted into an undetermined term distribution agreement, unless any of the parties thereto expressly waives such right with a 180 days prior notice. In the case of an early termination of a distribution agreement other than as a result of a persistent breach or force majeure, the Ferrari law entitles the non-breaching party to, among other things, certain termination payments. 
The U.S. economic recession, that began in 2008, caused domestic manufacturers to critically evaluate their respective dealer networks and terminate certain brands, and, as a result, the respective franchises. For example, General Motors chose to discontinue the Pontiac brand and, as a result, both of our Pontiac franchises were terminated. In addition, Ford chose to discontinue the Mercury brand and, as a result, all four of our Mercury franchises were terminated. Subject to similar future economic factors and material changes to the regulations discussed above, we generally expect our franchise agreements to survive for the foreseeable future and, when the agreements do not have indefinite terms, anticipate routine renewals of the agreements without substantial cost or modification.
Our dealership service departments perform vehicle repairs and service for customers under manufacturer warranties. We are reimbursed for the repairs and service directly from the manufacturer. Some manufacturers offer rebates to new vehicle customers that we are required, under specific program rules, to adequately document, support, and typically collect. In addition, some manufacturers provide us with incentives to order and/or sell certain models and/or volumes of inventory over designated periods of time. Under the terms of our dealership franchise agreements, the respective manufacturers are able to perform warranty, incentive, and rebate audits and charge us back for unsupported or non-qualifying warranty repairs, rebates or incentives.
In addition to the individual dealership franchise agreements discussed above, we have entered into framework agreements in the U.S. with most major vehicle manufacturers and distributors. These agreements impose a number of restrictions on our operations, including our ability to make acquisitions and obtain financing, and on our management. These agreements also impose change of control provisions related to the ownership of our common stock. For a discussion of these restrictions and the risks related to our relationships with vehicle manufacturers, please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
The following table sets forth the percentage of our new vehicle retail unit sales attributable to our top five manufacturers in terms of percent of new vehicle retail units sold:
 
Manufacturer | Percentage of NewVehicle RetailUnits Sold duringthe Year EndedDecember 31, 2016
Toyota | 24.9% 
BMW | 13.5% 
Ford | 11.0% 
Volkswagen | 11.0% 
Honda | 9.9%

Governmental Regulations
Automotive and Other Laws and Regulations
We operate in a highly regulated industry. A number of U.S. state and federal laws and regulations affect our business and the business of our manufacturers. In every state in which we operate in the U.S., we must obtain various licenses in order to conduct our businesses, including dealer, sales and finance, and insurance licenses issued by state regulatory authorities. Numerous laws and regulations govern our conduct of business, including those relating to our sales, operations, financing, insurance, advertising and employment practices. These laws and regulations include franchise laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers, as well as a variety of other laws and regulations. These laws also include U.S. federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws.
Our financing activities with customers are subject to U.S. federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, usury laws, and other installment sales laws and regulations. Some states in the U.S. regulate finance fees and charges that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us, or our dealerships, by individuals or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our licenses to conduct dealership operations and fines.
Our U.S. operations are subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and the rules and regulations of various state motor vehicle regulatory agencies. The imported automobiles that we purchase in the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties, and in the ordinary course of our business, we may, from time to time, be subject to claims for duties, penalties, liquidated damages or other charges.
Our U.S. operations are subject to consumer protection laws known as Lemon Laws. These laws typically require a manufacturer or dealer to replace a new vehicle or accept it for a full refund within one year after initial purchase, if the vehicle does not conform to the manufacturer’s express warranties and the dealer or manufacturer, after a reasonable number of attempts, is unable to correct or repair the defect. U.S. federal laws require various written disclosures to be provided on new vehicles, including mileage and pricing information. We are aware that several states in the U.S. are considering enacting consumer “bill-of-rights” statutes to provide further protection to the consumer which could affect our profitability in such states.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) with broad regulatory powers. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded from the CFPB’s regulatory authority, we are required to comply with regulations applicable to privacy notices, and the CFPB acted to regulate automotive financing activities through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions that service the automotive industry. The CFPB has issued regulatory guidance instructing financial institutions to monitor dealer loans for potential discrimination resulting from the system used to compensate dealers for assisting in the customer financing transaction. The CFPB has instructed lenders that, if discrimination is found, the lender would be required to change dealer compensation practices. In addition, the CFPB has announced its intention to regulate the sale of other finance and insurance products. If the result of either of these initiatives is to substantially restrict our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers for the purchase of vehicles and associated products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
Our operations in the United States as well as the United Kingdom and Brazil involve the use, handling and storage of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires, and fuel. We contract for recycling and/or dispose of used fluids, filters and other waste materials generated by our operations. In the United States, our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations governing management and disposal of materials and wastes, protection of the environment and occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations affect many aspects of our operations, such as requiring the acquisition of permits or other governmental approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which we handle, recycle and dispose of our wastes, requiring capital and operating expenditures to construct, maintain and upgrade pollution control and containment equipment and facilities, imposing specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, delays in permitting or in the performance of projects, and issuance of injunctions delaying, restricting or prohibiting some or all of our operations in affected areas. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.
15

Most of our dealerships utilize above-ground storage tanks, primarily for storing and dispensing petroleum-based products, and above-ground lifts used to raise vehicles. To a lesser extent, our dealerships use underground storage tanks and in-ground lifts. Storage tanks in the U.S. are subject to testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and its state law counterparts. Similarly, below ground lifts may contain fluid reservoirs that may leak. RCRA imposes requirements relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and requires us to comply with stringent and costly requirements in connection with our storage and recycling or disposal of the various used fluids, paints, batteries, tires, and fuels generated by our operations. Clean-up or other remedial action may be necessary in the event of leaks or other unauthorized discharges from storage tanks or other equipment operated by us. In addition, water quality protection programs under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) and comparable state and local programs in the U.S. govern certain wastewater and storm water discharges from our operations, which discharges may require permitting. Similarly, certain sources of air emissions from our operations including, for example, paint booths, may be subject to permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements, pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act and related state and local laws. Certain health and safety standards imposed under the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act or otherwise promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health administration of the U.S. Department of Labor and related state agencies are also applicable to protection of the health and safety of our employees.
We generally conduct environmental studies on dealerships to be acquired regardless of whether we are leasing or acquiring the underlying real property, and as necessary, implement environmental management practices or remedial or corrective actions to reduce the risk of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. We currently own or lease, and in connection with our acquisition program anticipate in the future owning or leasing, properties that in some instances have been used for auto retailing and servicing for many years. Laws regarding the prevention of pollution or remediation of environmental contamination generally apply regardless of whether we lease or purchase the land and facilities. Although we, or our predecessors, may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, a risk exists that petroleum products and wastes such as new and used motor oil, transmission fluids, antifreeze, lubricants, solvents and motor fuels could have been spilled or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, or under or from other locations where such materials were taken for recycling or disposal. Further, we believe that structures found on some of these properties may contain asbestos-containing materials, although in an undisturbed condition that does not require removal or other corrective action under applicable regulations. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose use, handling and disposal of such petroleum products or wastes were not under our control. In the United States, these properties and the materials transported and disposed from, or released on, them may be subject to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA,” also known as the Superfund law), RCRA and analogous state laws in the U.S., pursuant to which we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
The trend in environmental regulation is to often place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Consequently, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretations of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly vehicular pollution control equipment or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements, or delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. For example, vehicle manufacturers in the United States are subject to regulations adopted in 2012 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) that establish greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards applicable to light-duty vehicles for model year 2017 through 2021, with procedure in place to extend the application of these standards through model year 2025. Pursuant to these regulations, the EPA and NHTSA are expected to conduct mid-term reviews in 2017 to determine the technological progress and economic implications for extending these standards to model years 2022-2025. On January 12, 2017, the EPA completed its mid-term review and signed a determination to maintain the current GHG emissions standards for model year 2022-2025 vehicles. Whereas the CAFE standards are designed to improve vehicle fuel economy, the GHG standards are based on determinations made by the EPA, that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases, comprising GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Moreover, climate-change legislation and regulatory changes have been made or are being considered at United States’ federal and state levels as well as at international levels. For example, in December 2015, the United States joined other countries of the United Nations in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to review and establish goals for limiting GHG emissions. This “Paris agreement” was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions but, rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the Paris agreement, the adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of GHGs on vehicles and automotive fuels in the United States could adversely affect prices of and demand for the vehicles we sell.
16

Legal controls similar to those used in the United States and relating to the management and disposal of materials and wastes as well as protection of the environment exist in the United Kingdom and Brazil, where we also conduct operations. These legal controls as implemented and enforced in the United Kingdom and Brazil also affect many aspects of our operations in those countries. For example, with regards to the Paris agreement, the United Kingdom and Brazil each signed that agreement in April 2016. We may incur significant capital expenditures, operational costs and risks of liability and sanction as we seek to comply with those foreign-country environmental legal requirements.
Insurance and Bonding
Our operations expose us to the risk of various liabilities, including:

• | claims by employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury or property damage resulting from our operations; and


• | fines and civil and criminal penalties resulting from alleged violations of federal and state laws or regulatory requirements.

The automotive retailing business is also subject to substantial risk of real and personal property loss as a result of the significant concentration of real and personal property values at dealership locations. Under self-insurance programs, we retain various levels of risk associated with aggregate loss limits, per claim deductibles and claims handling expenses, including property and casualty, automobile physical damage, and employee medical benefits. In certain cases, we insure costs in excess of our retained risk under various contracts with third-party insurance carriers. Risk retention levels may change in the future as a result of changes in the insurance market or other factors affecting the economics of our insurance programs. Although we believe our insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot assure that we will not be exposed to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We make provisions for retained losses and deductibles by reflecting charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. Actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on historical claims experience, adjusted for current trends and changes in claims-handling procedures. The insurance companies that underwrite our insurance require that we secure certain of our obligations for self-insured exposures with collateral. Our collateral requirements are set by the insurance companies and, to date, have been satisfied by posting surety bonds, letters of credit and/or cash deposits. Our collateral requirements may change from time to time based on, among other things, our total insured exposure and the related self-insured retention assumed under the policies. We are subject to potential premium cost fluctuations with the annual renewal of these programs.
Employees
We believe our relationship with our employees is favorable. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 13,500 (full-time, part-time and temporary) people in the U.S., U.K. and Brazil, of whom:

• | 1,702 were employed in managerial positions;


• | 3,520 were employed in non-managerial vehicle sales department positions;


• | 6,186 were employed in non-managerial parts and service department positions; and


• | 2,129 were employed in administrative support positions.

In Brazil, all employees are represented by a local union. 
Because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers, we may be affected by labor strikes, work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturing facilities and/or their suppliers. Additionally, labor strikes, work slowdowns and walkouts at businesses participating in the distribution of manufacturers’ products may also affect us.

We generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the U.S., in the first and third quarters in the U.K. and during the third and fourth quarters in Brazil. This seasonality is generally attributable to consumer buying trends and the timing of manufacturer new vehicle model introductions. The first quarter is generally the weakest in Brazil, driven by heavy consumer vacations and activities associated with Carnival. In addition, in some regions of the U.S., vehicle purchases decline during the winter months due to inclement weather. For the U.K., the first and third calendar quarters tend to be stronger, driven by plate change months of March and September. As a result of all these factors, our consolidated revenues and operating income are typically lower in the first and fourth quarters and higher in the second and third quarters. Other factors unrelated to seasonality, such as changes in economic condition,

inventory availability, manufacturer incentive programs or shifts in governmental taxes or regulations may exaggerate seasonal or cause counter-seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating income.
