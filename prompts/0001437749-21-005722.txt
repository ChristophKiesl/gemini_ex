ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Avalon Holdings Corporation (“Avalon” or the “Company”) was formed on April 30, 1998 as a subsidiary of American Waste Services, Inc. (“AWS”). On June 17, 1998, AWS distributed, as a special dividend, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Avalon to the holders of AWS common stock on a pro rata and corresponding basis (the “Spin-off”). The history and organization of the remaining operations, some of which were contributed to Avalon as a result of the Spin-off, are described below.
 
In June 1990, AWS purchased approximately 5.6 acres of real estate located in Warren, Ohio on which it constructed Avalon’s corporate headquarters. In connection with the acquisition of such property, Avalon Lakes Golf, Inc. (“ALGI”), a former subsidiary of AWS and now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, acquired the real and personal property associated with the Avalon Lakes Golf Course, an 18-hole golf course adjacent to the office property. The corporate headquarters and ALGI were contributed to Avalon by AWS. The Avalon corporate headquarters building includes a clubhouse, restaurant, golf simulators and a pro shop for the Avalon Golf and Country Club at Avalon Lakes Golf Course.
 
In 1995, American Waste Management Services, Inc. (“AWMS”) commenced its waste disposal brokerage and management operations and in 1997, American Landfill Management, Inc. (“ALMI”) started its captive landfill management operations. Both companies were contributed to Avalon by AWS and now are wholly owned subsidiaries of Avalon.
 
In November 2003, TBG, Inc. (“TBG”), a subsidiary of ALGI, entered into a long-term lease agreement with Squaw Creek Country Club to lease and operate its golf course and related facilities. As a result of the transaction, Avalon created a newly organized subsidiary, Avalon Golf and Country Club, Inc. (“AGCC”) which manages all the golf courses and related operations.
 
In October 2006, Avalon, through a newly created subsidiary, Avalon Country Club at Sharon, Inc. (“Sharon”), completed the acquisition of the Sharon Country Club assets. The primary assets of the Sharon club include the golf course and clubhouse. Avalon renovated the clubhouse and constructed additional recreational facilities and operates the Sharon facilities as part of its Avalon Golf and Country Club.
 
In June 2011, AWMS Water Solutions, LLC was formed to acquire options on properties for the purpose of operating salt water injection wells. AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, manages all the salt water injection well operations, including the marketing and sales function and all decisions regarding the well operations for a percentage of the gross revenues.
 
In August 2013, Avalon created a new Ohio limited liability company, AWMS Holdings, LLC, to act as a holding company to form and own a series of wholly owned subsidiaries that will own and operate salt water injection wells and facilities (together the “facilities”). AWMS Holdings, LLC, offers investment opportunities to accredited investors by selling membership units of AWMS Holdings, LLC through private placement offerings. The monies received from these offerings, along with internally contributed capital, are used to construct the facilities necessary for the operation of salt water injection wells. As a result of the private placement offering, Avalon is not the majority owner of AWMS Holdings, LLC; however, due to the managerial control of AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, AWMS Holdings, LLC is a variable interest entity (“VIE”), and the financial statements of AWMS Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries are included in Avalon’s consolidated financial statements.
 
In August 2013, AWMS Holdings, LLC formed its first wholly owned subsidiary, AWMS Rt. 169, LLC, to own and operate two salt water injection wells. AWMS Rt. 169, LLC leases 5.2 acres on which the salt water injection wells are located. As further described below, based on the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management’s decision, the operations of the two salt water injection wells are currently suspended.
 
In August 2014, Avalon, through a newly created subsidiary, The Avalon Resort and Spa LLC, completed the acquisition of The Magnuson Grand Hotel in Howland, Ohio. Subsequent to the acquisition, The Magnuson Grand Hotel was renamed The Avalon Inn. In 2019, The Avalon Inn was renamed and now operates as The Grand Resort. The primary assets of The Grand Resort include the hotel, indoor junior Olympic size swimming pool, outdoor resort pool, Roman Bath, fitness center, restaurants, bars, cigar lounge, salon and spa, banquet and conference facilities and adjoining recreation and tennis center. The Grand Resort is located adjacent to Avalon’s corporate headquarters and the Avalon Lakes Golf Course. In 2020, The Grand Resort was in operation but still in the process of being renovated and expanded. The renovations and expansion include the renovation of existing hotel rooms, addition of a new restaurant, bars, cigar lounge and salon and spa. The Grand Resort operates in conjunction with the Avalon Golf and Country Club.

In July 2016, the Company formed Avalon Resorts and Clubs, Inc. (“ARCI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, the purpose of which is to hold the corporate activity of Avalon Clubs, Inc. and Avalon Resorts, Inc., both formed concurrently with ARCI.  Avalon Clubs, Inc. was formed to hold the wholly owned subsidiaries of the Avalon Golf and Country Club, while Avalon Resorts, Inc. holds the operations of The Grand Resort. 
 
In March 2018, Avalon, through a newly created subsidiary, Avalon Mahoning Sports Center, Inc., completed the acquisition of the Boardman Tennis Center property in Boardman, Ohio. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Boardman Tennis Center property was renamed the Avalon Athletic Club at Boardman. The primary assets of the Avalon Athletic Club at Boardman include the acquired real property consisting of the building and associated land. The Avalon Athletic Club at Boardman facility is a multipurpose recreation center including indoor tennis, basketball, volleyball and pickleball courts and a fitness area. The Avalon Athletic Club at Boardman operates as part of its Avalon Golf and Country Club.
 
In May 2019, Havana Cigar Shop, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, completed the acquisition of the New Castle Country Club real property assets located in New Castle, Pennsylvania. Subsequent to the acquisition, Havana Cigar Shop, Inc. was named Avalon Field Club at New Castle. The primary assets of Avalon Field Club at New Castle include the acquired real property consisting of the golf course and associated clubhouse. Avalon Field Club at New Castles operates as part of its Avalon Golf and Country Club. In 2020, Avalon began renovating the existing clubhouse.
 
Business Segments Information
 
Avalon’s business segments are waste management services and golf and related operations. The waste management services segment includes waste disposal brokerage and management services, captive landfill management operations and salt water injection well operations. The golf and related operations segment includes the operation and management of four golf courses and related clubhouses, a hotel, fitness centers, tennis courts, salon and spa services, dining, banquet and conference facilities and a travel agency. In 2020 and 2019, no customer individually accounted for 10% or more of Avalon’s business segment or consolidated net operating revenues.
Waste Management Services
 
Avalon’s waste management subsidiaries provide hazardous and nonhazardous waste disposal brokerage and management services, captive landfill management services and salt water injection well operations. Waste management services are provided to industrial, commercial, municipal and governmental customers primarily in selected northeastern and midwestern United States markets. For the years 2020 and 2019, the net operating revenues of the waste management services segment represented approximately 69% and 71%, respectively, of Avalon’s total consolidated net operating revenues.
 
AWMS assists customers with managing and disposing of wastes at approved treatment and disposal sites based upon a customer’s needs.
 
Because waste generators remain liable for their waste, both before and after disposal, they require assurance that their waste will be safely and properly transported, treated and disposed of. To give customers this confidence, as well as to limit its own potential liability, AWMS has instituted procedures designed to minimize the risks of improper handling or disposal of waste.
 
Before AWMS will provide waste brokerage or management services, a potential customer must complete a detailed waste profile setting forth the amount, chemical composition and any unique characteristics for each type of waste to be handled. Representative samples of the waste are analyzed by a state or federally certified laboratory. In addition, an AWMS representative generally inspects the process generating the waste, the location where the waste may be temporarily stored or the site of the remediation project producing the waste, and interviews representatives of the generator familiar with the waste. This inspection, along with the laboratory results, allows AWMS to determine whether the waste is within acceptable parameters for disposal and, if so, what special handling and treatment procedures must be instituted. If the waste is continuously generated, new representative samples are tested on a periodic basis.

These procedures are important to both AWMS and its customers because the key to proper handling of waste is accurate identification. Hazardous waste which is not identified as such, and thus, improperly disposed of can result in substantial liability to the waste generator, the disposal facility, AWMS and potentially to all other waste generators that have used the disposal site. Conversely, waste that could safely and legally be disposed of in a solid waste landfill, but is instead sent to a hazardous waste facility for treatment and disposal, will result in substantial and unnecessary expense to the generator.
 
ALMI is a landfill management company that provides technical and operational services to customers owning captive disposal facilities. A captive disposal facility only disposes of waste generated by the owner of such facility. ALMI provides turnkey services, including daily operations, facilities management and management reporting for its customers. Currently, ALMI manages one captive disposal facility located in Ohio. In addition, American Construction Supply, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ALMI, sells construction mats.
 
AWMS Holdings, LLC, is a holding company that was created to form and own a series of wholly owned subsidiaries that own and operate salt water injection wells and facilities. AWMS Holdings, LLC, offers investment opportunities to accredited investors by selling membership units of AWMS Holdings, LLC through private placement offerings. The monies received from these offerings, along with internally contributed capital, are used to construct the facilities necessary for the operation of salt water injection wells. AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalon, manages the operations, including the marketing and sales function and all the decisions regarding the well operations for a percentage of the gross revenues. As a result of the private placement offering, Avalon is not the majority owner of AWMS Holdings, LLC; however, due to the managerial control of AWMS Water Solutions, LLC, AWMS Holdings, LLC is a VIE, and the financial statements of AWMS Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries are included in Avalon’s consolidated financial statements.
 
AWMS Holdings, LLC formed its first wholly owned subsidiary, AWMS Rt. 169, LLC, to own and operate two salt water injection wells. AWMS Rt. 169, LLC leases 5.2 acres on which the salt water injection wells are located. As further described below, based on the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management’s decision, the operations of the two salt water injection wells are currently suspended.
 
Golf and Related Operations
 
Avalon’s golf and related operations segment includes the operation and management of four golf courses and related country clubs and facilities, a hotel and its associated resort amenities, an athletic center and a travel agency. For the years 2020 and 2019, the net operating revenues of the golf and related operations segment represented approximately 31% and 29%, respectively, of Avalon’s total consolidated net operating revenues.
 
ALGI owns and operates a Pete Dye designed championship golf course located in Warren, Ohio. ALGI generates revenue from membership dues, greens fees, cart rentals, merchandise, and food and beverage sales.
 
TBG, a subsidiary of ALGI, entered into a long-term agreement with Squaw Creek Country Club to lease and operate its golf course and related facilities. The lease, which commenced on November 1, 2003, has an initial term of ten (10) years with four (4) consecutive ten (10) year renewal term options unilaterally exercisable by TBG. In addition to a championship golf course, the Squaw Creek facilities include a swimming pool, tennis courts and a clubhouse that includes a fitness center, dining and banquet facilities. TBG generates its revenue in the same manner as ALGI, but also generates revenues from tennis and swimming.
 
Avalon Travel, Inc., a subsidiary of ALGI, owns and operates a travel agency which generates its revenue from booking travel reservations.
 
In October 2006, Avalon, through its subsidiary, Avalon Country Club of Sharon, Inc., completed the acquisition of the Sharon Country Club assets. The primary assets of Sharon include the golf course and clubhouse which includes, dining and banquet facilities, a swimming pool, salon and spa services and a fitness center. Sharon generates its revenue in the same manner as ALGI and TBG, but also generates revenues from its fitness center and salon and spa services.

In November 2003, Avalon formed the Avalon Golf and Country Club to manage its golf courses and the related operations. Members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club are entitled to privileges at all the facilities. Membership requires payment of annual dues. Members receive several benefits including reduced greens fees, preferential tee times and discounts on merchandise. In addition, members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club also have access to all of the amenities offered by The Grand Resort. The Avalon Golf and Country Club competes with many public courses and country clubs in the area. Although the golf courses continue to be available to the general public, the primary source of revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Avalon believes that the combination of its golf facilities and The Grand Resort will result in additional memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club. The ability to retain current members and attract new members has been an ongoing challenge. Although Avalon was able to increase the number of members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club, as of December 31, 2020, Avalon has not attained its membership goals. There can be no assurance as to when such goals will be attained. Avalon is continually using different marketing strategies to attract new members, such as local television advertising and various membership promotions. A significant decline in members could adversely affect the future financial performance of Avalon.

The golf courses are significantly dependent upon weather conditions during the golf season as a result of being located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania. Avalon’s financial performance is adversely affected by adverse weather conditions.
 
Financial impact of COVID-19 pandemic
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially concentrated in China, the outbreak spread to other countries and infections have been reported globally including in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 viral disease a pandemic. The duration of the outbreak and new information which continually emerges concerning the severity of the illness and its treatment still remains unclear. As a result, the federal and state governmental bodies have taken unprecedented measures to try and control the spread of the virus.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 15, 2020, the Governor of the State of Ohio announced that the Ohio Department of Health (“ODH”) issued a Director's Order (the “Order”) temporarily closing all Ohio bars and restaurants to in-house patrons. The Order stated that restaurants with take-out and delivery options could continue to operate those services, even as their dining rooms were temporarily closed. The Order also placed a limit on mass gatherings and large community events.
 
On March 19, 2020, the ODH issued a Director’s Order temporarily closing all salons and spas in the state of Ohio and also further limited the number of individuals for gatherings. On March 23, 2020, a “Stay at Home” order was issued by the ODH. The Stay at Home order stated that all individuals living within the State of Ohio are ordered to stay at home or at their place of residence. Under the order, individuals were only allowed to leave their home for essential activities including tasks related to their health and safety, obtaining necessary supplies and services and certain types of work. The Stay at Home order required all non-essential businesses to cease operations. In March 2020 the Governor of the state of Pennsylvania issued a similar Stay at Home order. Under the order, all non-essential businesses were required to cease operations.
 
In accordance with the “Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce” guidance issued by the U.S Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency on March 19, 2020, the Company’s waste management services, restaurant carry-out, overnight lodging and outdoor golf courses remained in operation during the Order.
 
In late May and June 2020, the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania allowed the reopening of certain business operations that were temporarily closed under the Order. The Company’s dining rooms, fitness, athletic, pool, salon and spa services reopened under certain mandatory restrictions including mask protection for employees, decrease in occupancy and hours of operation and other measures to enforce social distancing. On December 12, 2020, additional temporary mitigation measures were placed into effect until January 4, 2021 in the state of Pennsylvania. These measures included prohibiting in-house dining and indoor activities at gym and fitness facilities. Indoor gatherings and events of more than 10 people were also prohibited under the mitigation measures.
 
During 2020, the various governmental orders issued to control the spread of COVID-19 adversely impacted our operations and related financial results. Our restaurant operations generated significantly lower revenue as a result of the restrictions that were placed on in-house dining. Food and beverages sales related to banquets and conferences were significantly lower during 2020 as a result of restrictions placed on gatherings and events. In addition, the Company had high levels of room and event cancellations with some subsequent re-bookings that occurred in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021. Our fitness, athletics, salon and spa operations generated no revenue under the Stay at Home orders. In addition, our waste management brokerage business has experienced a decline in both continuous and event work due to government restrictions placed on its customers and associated shutdowns.
 
We may continue to experience weakened demand in light of continued travel restrictions or warnings, consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending and general economic uncertainty. In light of the foregoing, we are unable to determine when our operations will return to pre-pandemic demand or pricing. The Company engaged in efforts to reduce expenses, including reducing employee costs, through hiring freezes, headcount reductions and substantial furloughs of employees. The Company rehired employees in late May to meet business needs as the government restrictions on certain business operations were reduced or lifted. Governmental bodies may continue to impose additional restrictions, which could include additional shutdowns, to stop the spread of infection. These additional restrictions would have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 
Governmental regulations
 
The federal government and numerous state and local governmental bodies are continuing to consider legislation or regulations to either restrict or impede the disposal and/or transportation of waste. A portion of Avalon’s waste brokerage and management services revenues is derived from the disposal and/or transportation of out-of-state waste. Any law or regulation restricting or impeding the transportation of waste or the acceptance of out-of-state waste for disposal could have a negative effect on Avalon. Avalon’s waste brokerage and management services may also be affected by the trend toward laws requiring the development of waste reduction and recycling or other programs.
 
Avalon’s golf course operations, The Grand Resort and multipurpose recreation center currently hold liquor licenses for their respective facilities. If, for some reason, any one of these facilities were to lose their liquor license, the financial performance of the golf and related operations would be adversely affected.

On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, permits net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, to offset 100% of taxable income for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, and 80% of taxable income in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020. In addition, the CARES Act allows net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. The adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
 
On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “Appropriations Act”) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Appropriations Act, among other things, temporarily extends through December 31, 2025, certain expiring tax provisions, including look-through treatment of payments of dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received or accrued from related controlled foreign corporations. Additionally, the Appropriations Act enacts new provisions and extends certain provisions originated within the CARES Act, including an extension of time for repayment of the deferred portion of employees’ payroll tax through December 31, 2021, and a temporary allowance for full deduction of certain business meals. Avalon has elected not to defer the employees’ portion of payroll tax. Management is currently evaluating the other provisions of the Appropriations Act, but at present time does not expect that the other provisions of the Appropriations Act would result in a material tax or cash benefit.
 
Sales and marketing
 
Avalon’s sales and marketing approach is decentralized, with each business segment being responsible for its own sales and marketing efforts. Each business segment employs its own sales force which concentrates on expanding its business.
 
Competition
 
The hazardous and nonhazardous waste disposal brokerage and management business is highly competitive and fragmented. Avalon’s waste disposal brokerage and management business competes with other brokerage companies, as well as, with companies which own treatment and disposal facilities. In addition to price, knowledge and service are key factors when competing for waste disposal brokerage and management business. Avalon’s waste disposal brokerage and management operations obtain and retain customers by providing services and identifying cost-efficient disposal options unique to a customer’s needs. Consolidation within the solid waste industry has resulted in a reduction in the number of disposal options available to waste generators and may cause disposal pricing to increase. Avalon may need to absorb all or a portion of these cost increases depending upon competitive conditions at the time.
 
Avalon’s golf courses are located in Warren, Ohio, Vienna, Ohio, Sharon, Pennsylvania and New Castle, Pennsylvania and compete with many public courses and country clubs in the area.
 
The Grand Resort’s principal competitors are operators of full service, select service and extended stay properties, including major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. We also compete against small chains and independent and local owners and operators. We compete for guests based primarily on the resort complex and country club experience created through the combination of the resort and country club operations.
 
Insurance
 
Avalon carries $11,000,000 of liability insurance coverage. This insurance includes coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability and other customary coverage. In addition, Avalon also carries $6,000,000 of separate liability insurance coverage for the golf courses and related operations. Avalon carries comprehensive property damage coverage and, also, professional liability insurance for its fitness, swimming, salon and spa activities. No assurance can be given that such insurance will be available in the future or, if available, that the premiums for such insurance will be reasonable.
 
If Avalon were to incur a substantial liability for damages not covered by insurance or in excess of its policy limits or at a time when Avalon no longer is able to obtain appropriate liability insurance, its financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, Avalon had 482 employees, 33 of whom were employed by the waste management services segment, 425 of whom were employed by the golf and related operations and 24 of whom were employed in financial and administrative activities. Avalon believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.

Our principal human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop employees for key roles and future leadership positions through a variety of training and development programs. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management. We seek diverse talent internally and externally in an effort to achieve broader diverse representation throughout our company.
 
The health and safety of our employees is foundational to achieving these objectives. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a system that allows for pay protection for employees with symptoms, diagnosed, exposed or at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and a notification process for potential COVID-19 exposure.
 
Other business factors
 
None of Avalon’s business segments is materially dependent on patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions, other than permits, licenses and approvals issued by regulatory agencies. Avalon does not sponsor significant research and development activities.
