Acquisitions
 
On April 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Spontania from Spain-based Dialcom Networks, S.L. in an all-cash deal for €3.66 million (approximately US$5.1 million). Spontania, a software-based cloud collaboration solution, combines the benefits of video conferencing and web conferencing into an enterprise solution that can scale to tens of thousands of users. The addition of Spontania was made with the intent to make us the only company offering an entirely software-based video conferencing product line and to provide on-premise cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions complementing our existing premise-based, enterprise video conferencing offering, COLLABORATE®.
 
On March 7, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Sabine, Inc. (“Sabine”) through a stock purchase agreement (“SPA”). Sabine manufactured, designed and sold Sacom professional wireless microphone systems for live and installed audio. It also manufactured the FBX Feedback Exterminator for reliable automatic feedback control. With the addition of Sabine, we have reliable and exclusive access to the wireless microphones that are a critical component of our complete microphone portfolio. Pursuant to the SPA, we (i) paid initial consideration of $6.89 million in cash and approximately $1.68 million in ClearOne shares. In addition, we paid off Sabine debt of $1.25 million and may be required to make earn-out payments over a three-year period from the acquisition date based on achievement of certain performance criteria.
 
On February 16, 2012, we completed the acquisition of the video conferencing business of Israel-based VCON Video Conferencing, Ltd. (“VCON”). VCON was a pioneer in software based video conferencing solutions with product offerings that include group video conferencing endpoints, desktop video conferencing endpoints, video conferencing infrastructure solutions and software development kits. This acquisition and the combination of our streaming and digital signage technologies has provided us with complementary technology opportunities allowing us to enter new growth markets. Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, ClearOne paid consideration of $4.6 million in cash to VCON in consideration for all the assets, including intellectual property, fixed assets and inventory, and assumed no debt.

CHAT group speakerphones have the ability to add high-quality, full-duplex speakerphones to user enterprise telephone handsets such as Avaya and Cisco. CHAT group speakerphones make it possible to introduce rich, crystal clear conferencing capability without the need for introducing a separate traditional conference phone. CHATAttach® is comprised of two CHAT group speakerphones which can be daisy-chained together to function as a single conferencing system.
 
VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS
 
Our visual communication products include media collaboration and network streaming products. Our visual communication products contributed 11%, 7% and 6% of our consolidated revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Media Collaboration:
 
Our comprehensive portfolio of industry-leading COLLABORATE® branded HD videoconferencing solutions bring cutting-edge software-based full HD (1080p) video conferencing technology with H.264 High Profile encoding that reduces bandwidth utilization up to 50 percent. COLLABORATE is comprised of feature-rich room systems and desktop video applications, as well as enhanced network management, infrastructure solutions and software development kits.
 
COLLABORATE Infrastructure is for customers who desire an on-premise infrastructure solution. ClearOne offers a single-unit infrastructure server that will serve the needs of both the small to mid-sized businesses and enterprise customers hoping to expand locations. The heavy burden of adding video collaboration pervasively has always been the cost of expensive infrastructure solutions. ClearOne’s single-unit solution provides the infrastructure component at a low price, including directory services, firewall traversal, MCU, H.323 gatekeeper, SIP registrar, license server, call control, and a full management system.
 
COLLABORATE Desktop is a versatile application for any PC or laptop user in organizations of any size. Available with up to 1080p resolution, the COLLABORATE Desktop offers multiple media transmitting capabilities for video, audio and data. Using ClearOne’s DualStream™ technology, the application has the ability to send and receive video and data streams simultaneously with its additional streaming capability, ClearOne’s Simulcast™ allows COLLABORATE Desktop users to chair or participate in corporate broadcasts.
 
COLLABORATE Room is a best-in-class video conferencing and collaboration solution offering a price-point and feature set vastly superior to that of competing room conferencing solutions. Designed for small and medium businesses and corporate meeting rooms, the COLLABORATE Room features software-based and server-less embedded multipoint (up to 9-way) video conferencing, SIP/H.323 bridging interoperability, built-in recording and streaming, built-in remote content and data sharing, and interactive multicast.
 
The new COLLABORATE® Room Pro all-in-one appliance combines high-definition 1080p60 video with ClearOne’s wildly popular Beamforming Microphone Array for the best audio available on any self-contained video conferencing solution, without using an external DSP unit for audio processing. This new system, available with a 9-party MCU, also includes many media collaboration tools that usually purchased separately, such as: streaming, recording and content creation, presentation.
 
UNITE™ PTZ Camera complements the COLLABORATE product line, and comes with DVI-I (for digital and analog output) and USB 3.0 connectivity that enables users to easily add Full-HD video to UC or video applications running on desktop/laptop. With powerful optical zoom and wide field of view make this camera more suitable for medium to large meeting spaces. Full high definition video in up to 1080p60 resolution helps the remote sites in video conferencing see every detail, even when displayed on a large screen. During the first quarter of 2016 we launched the ClearOne UNITE® 200 PTZ Camera, a superbly versatile, professional-grade, HD video camera complete with USB, HDMI, and IP connections that can be used for the widest possible range of applications at a price significantly lower than competitive models.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
 
Through the Spontania acquisition in 2014, ClearOne started offering Spontania cloud-based Media Collaboration solutions. Spontania empowers customers to deploy video collaboration without the heavy burden of expensive infrastructure. It also allows service providers and partners to expand their offerings by deploying the technology within their own networks. Spontania complements ClearOne’s premise-based COLLABORATE enterprise video collaboration portfolio. The complete ClearOne video portfolio now can serve a full range of video collaboration needs for enterprise, SMB, healthcare, education, and other customers, whether they are seeking those solutions deployed in their private data centers or in the ClearOne Spontania cloud. ClearOne now offers its partners and end users a clear choice between public cloud, private cloud, and on-premise solutions.
 
Network Streaming and Digital Signage:
 
Our network streaming products are primarily sold under VIEW™ and VIEW Pro brands deliver the ultimate IP A/V experience by streaming time sensitive high definition audio and video and control over TCP/IP networks. By combining audio and/or video content, meta-data and control signals into one digital stream in harmony with industry standards, its distributed, edge of the network architecture allows the hardware and the processing power to be distributed across any existing TCP/IP network. This leverages many of the advantages of using TCP/IP over traditional analog systems and other centrally controlled IP-based systems. The ClearOne VIEW and VIEW Pro products are powered by ClearOne’s patented StreamNet® technology. A user can activate and control a single audio source or combination of audio sources, video sources, security systems, HVAC systems, lighting, and other room or facility monitoring functions such as paging or security access by just a single touch to its attractive touch screens. Alternatively, any PC, laptop, tablet, iPod, or other device with a built-in web browser with Flash can control the equipment connected to the system. The VIEW and VIEW Pro systems have no limits on the numbers of sources, displays, or amplifiers in a project and can be used in venues from high-end residential homes to large-scale commercial projects.
 
Converting an audio or video signal to TCP/IP preserves the digital quality of the signal across the network. Unlike analog systems, which lose quality over long distances, TCP/IP packets are decoded to retain the same digital quality as contained when they were encoded. The addition of Digital Encoder and Digital Decoder products with DVI/HDMI input and output enhances the flexibility of complete AV distribution system and makes it as easy to use as analog devices.
 
VIEW Pro solution provides 1080p60, H.264 high definition HDMI video-audio, 4:4:4 true-color, 24 bit per pixel video output. It comes with dual inputs encoder and single output decoder with balanced audio, general purpose control ports and clock synchronized video output. VIEW Pro system also provides multi-view video composition and video-wall features using its built-in video processing engine, without using external expensive hardware video processors. This continues to be truly differentiated in the professional market by offering complete AV streaming and distribution systems that can scale to fulfill projects of any size and complexity, from light commercial to the very largest environments. VIEW Pro products include E110 and E120 encoders and D110 and D210 decoders. VIEW Pro solution also comes with multiple license options including audio mixing, video composition, video wall, multicast RTSP, local playback and USB HID.
 
During the second quarter of 2016, we introduced the new VIEW CONSOLE configuration management software. This software gives integrators a comprehensive platform from which to configure, manage, monitor, and control VIEW system installation using an easy, modern interface. The new toolset, which spotlights the latest in advanced software development technologies, works across ClearOne’s full line of VIEW/VIEW Pro products.
 
At the end of May 2016, we introduced a new flexible and single-channel-priced VIEW® Pro E110 Encoder — designed for single-media input settings. E110 Encoder delivers high-quality video with configurable 4:4:4 and 4:2:0 color sampling; standards-based streaming formats; 1080p60, H.264-based, high-profile encoding with lossless compression; very low end-to-end latency; and full HDCP support. We also introduced the innovative new entry-level VIEW Pro D310 Decoder featuring all the basic functionality to fully satisfy simple applications while delivering superb price-to-performance value. D310 Decoder features convenience in its small footprint and easy mounting behind any display. It delivers full-screen, single-image video; high-quality video with 4:2:0 video color sampling; and 1080p60, H.264-based high-profile decoding with lossless compression.

MARKETING AND SALES
 
We primarily use a two-tier channel model through which we sell our commercial products to a worldwide network of independent audiovisual, information technology and telecommunications distributors, who then sell our products to independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added resellers, who in turn work directly with the end-users of our products for product fulfillment and installation, if needed. Our products are also specified and recommended by professional audio-video consultants. We also sell our commercial products directly to certain dealers, systems integrators, value-added resellers, and end-users.
 
Our product sales generated in the United States and outside the United States for the years ended December 31 are as follows:
 

Revenue in millions | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
----------------------+---------+------+------+-----+--------
 | Revenue | | % | | Revenue | | % | Revenue | | | % | 
In the United States | $ | 31.8 | | 65 | % | $ | 39.6 | | 68 | % | | $ | 39.8 | 69 | %
Outside United States | $ | 16.8 | | 35 | % | $ | 18.2 | | 32 | % | | $ | 18.1 | 31 | %
 | $ | 48.6 | | 100 | % | $ | 57.8 | | 100 | % | | $ | 57.9 | 100 | %



We sell directly to our distributors, resellers and end-users in approximately 60 countries worldwide. We anticipate that the portion of our total product revenue from international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue as we further enhance our focus on developing new products, establishing new channel partners, strengthening our presence in key growth areas, complying with regional environmental regulatory standards, and improving product localization with country-specific product documentation and marketing materials.
 
Distributors, Resellers and Independent Integrators
 
We sold our products directly to approximately 341 distributors and direct resellers throughout the world during 2016. Distributors and resellers purchase our products at a discount from list price and resell them worldwide to hundreds of independent systems integrators, telephony value-added resellers, IT value-added resellers, and PC dealers on a non-exclusive basis. Our distributors maintain their own inventory and accounts receivable and are required to provide technical and non-technical support for our products to the next level of distribution participants. We work with our distributors and resellers to establish appropriate inventory stocking levels. We also work with our distributors and resellers to maintain relationships with our existing systems integrators, dealers, and other value-added resellers.
 
While dealers, resellers, and system integrators all sell our products directly to the end-users, system integrators typically add significant value to each sale by combining our products with products from other manufacturers as part of an integrated system solution. Commercial dealers and value-added resellers usually purchase our products from distributors and may bundle our products with products from other manufacturers for resale to the end-user. We maintain close working relationships with all our reseller partners and offer them education and training on all of our products.
 
Marketing
 
Much of our marketing effort is conducted in conjunction with our channel partners who provide leverage for us in reaching existing and prospective customers worldwide. We also regularly attend industry forums and exhibit our products at multiple regional and international trade shows, often with our channel partners. These trade shows provide exposure for our brand and products to a wide audience. We market our ClearOne-branded commercial products on our website www.clearone.com and our MagicBox branded digital signage products on our website www.magicboxinc.com. We also conduct public relations initiatives to get press coverage and product reviews in industry and non-industry publications alike.

Customers
 
We do not get comprehensive reports from our distributors and resellers that identify our end-users. As a result, we do not know whether any end-user accounted for more than 10 percent of our total revenue during any of the periods reported in this Annual Report. However, revenues included sales to Starin Marketing, which represented approximately 16.3% of consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 with no other end-user accounting for more that 10 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2015 sales to Starin Marketing and VSO Marketing represented approximately 14.2% and 10.4% of consolidated revenue, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014 sales to Starin Marketing represented approximately 16% of consolidated revenue with no other end-user accounting for more that 10 percent.
 
As discussed above, distributors facilitate product sales to a large number of independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added resellers, and subsequently to their end-users. The loss of one or more distributors could reduce revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our shipped orders on which we had not recognized revenue were $3.9 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had a backlog of unshipped orders of approximately $0.6 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Competition
 
The audio-visual product markets are characterized by intense competition, rapidly evolving technology, and increased business consolidation. We compete with businesses having substantially greater financial, research and product development, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources. If we are not able to continually design, manufacture, and successfully market new or enhanced products or services that are comparable or superior to those provided by our competitors and at comparable or better prices, we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales, gross profit margins, profits, and market share, each of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Our competitors vary within each product category. We believe we are able to differentiate ourselves and therefore successfully compete as a result of the high audio quality of our products resulting from a combination of proprietary and highly advanced audio signal processing technologies and networking technology in the form of trade secrets and patented intellectual property, technical and channel support services, and the strength of our channels and brands.
 
We believe the principal factors driving sales are the following:
 

● | Quality, features and functionality, and ease of use of the products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broad and deep global channel partnerships; 
● | Significant established history of successful worldwide installations for diverse vertical markets; 
● | Brand name recognition and acceptance; 
● | Quality of customer and partner sales and technical support services; and 
● | Effective sales and marketing. 

 
In the professional audio conferencing system and sound reinforcement markets our main competitors include AcousticMagic, Biamp, Bose, Crestron, Extron, Harman, Peavey, Phoenix Audio, Polycom, QSC, Symetrix, Vaddio and Yamaha and their original equipment manufacturing (OEM) partners, along with several other companies potentially poised to enter the market. We occupy the number one position in the global professional audio conferencing market with more than 50% of the global market share.
 
In the professional microphones market, our primary competitors include AKG, Audio Technica, Audix, Avlex, Beyerdynamic, Biamp, Clock Audio, Lectrosonics, Media Vision, Nureva, Phoenix Audio, Polycom, Sennheiser, Shure, TeachLogic, TOA and Yamaha and their OEM partners.
 
In the traditional tabletop conferencing market, we face significant competition from Avaya/Konftel, Phoenix Audio, Polycom and Yamaha, and especially from their OEM partnerships. A significant portion of the tabletop market is covered by sales through OEM partnerships. While we believe MAX products have unique features and superior quality, our limited OEM partnerships and pricing pressures from higher volume competitors limit our ability to expand our existing share of this market.
 
Our primary competitors in the personal conferencing market are GN Netcom (Jabra), Logitech, Phoenix Audio, Plantronics, Polycom and Yamaha and their OEM partners.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
 
Our video conferencing products face tremendous competition from well established players as well as emerging players, including Acano, Avaya, Aver, Barco, Blue Jeans, Cisco, Citrix, FuzeBox, Huawei, InFocus, Kramer, Logitech, Magor, Microsoft, Pexip, Polycom, Starleaf, Telylabs, UNIFY, Vidyo, Yealink, Zoom and ZTE. We believe the migration of video conferencing from hardware-based codecs to software-based codecs provides an opportunity for us to differentiate our products and gain market share.
 
Our network streaming products which includes digital signage products face intense competition from a few well-established corporations of diversified capabilities and strengths, including Atlona, Aurora Multimedia, Barco, Biamp, Broadsign, Cisco, Crestron, Extron, Gefen, Goopie, Haivision, Hall Research, Infocus (Jupiter), Key Digital, Kramer, Liberty AV, Magenta Research, Matrox, Mediasite, Ncast, RGB Spectrum, Scala, Spinetix, SVSi Volante, Teracue, Tightrope, tvONE, UCView, VBrick, Visionary Solutions, Visix, WyreStorm and ZeeVee. We believe that our pioneering and patented StreamNet technology delivers superior audio and video streaming performance and flexibility and provides us with a competitive edge over other industry players.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
Regulations regarding product safety, product operational agency compliance, the materials used in manufacturing, the process of disposing of electronic equipment and the efficient use of energy may require extensive lead-time to obtain regulatory approvals of new products in both domestic and international markets. Such regulations may impact our ability to expand our sales in a timely and cost-effective manner and, as a result, our business could be harmed.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We manufacture our products through electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers, who are generally responsible for sourcing and procuring required raw materials and components. Most of the components that our EMS providers require for manufacturing our products are readily available from a number of sources.
 
We continually work with our EMS providers to seek alternative sources for all our components and raw material requirements to ensure higher quality and better pricing. Most of our EMS providers and their vendors are duly qualified by our corporate quality assurance process. We work with our EMS providers to ensure that raw materials and components conform to our specifications.
 
Manufacturing
 
Currently, all of our products except a few digital signage products are manufactured by EMS providers. Our primary EMS provider is Flextronics. The digital signage products are assembled in our Salt Lake City, Utah facility.
Seasonality
 
Our revenue has historically been the strongest in the fourth quarter and the weakest in the first quarter, even though a consistent pattern could not be established for seasonality between the quarters. There can be no assurance that any historic sales patterns will continue and, as a result, sales for any prior quarter are not necessarily indicative of the sales to be expected in any future quarter.
Research and Product Development
 
We are committed to research and product development and view our continued investment in research and product development as a key ingredient to our long-term business success. Our research and product development expenditures were approximately $8.6 million, $8.3 million and $9.0 million, during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Our core competencies in research and product development include (a) many audio technologies, including acoustic echo cancellation, noise cancellation and other advanced adaptive digital signal processing technologies, (b) networking and multimedia streaming technologies, and (c) video technologies. We also have expertise in wireless technologies, VoIP, software and network application, and digital signage system development. We believe that continued investment in our core technological competencies is vital to developing new products and to enhancing existing products.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements and processes to protect our proprietary rights. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as the laws of the United States.
 
We generally require our employees, certain customers and partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any confidential aspect of our technology, services, or business. In addition, our employees are required to assign to us any proprietary information, inventions, or other technology created during the term of their employment with us. However, these precautions may not be sufficient to protect us from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 151 full-time employees. Of these employees, 93 were located in our Salt Lake City location, 31 in other U.S. locations, and 27 in locations outside the U.S. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also hire contractors with specific skill sets to meet our operational needs.
