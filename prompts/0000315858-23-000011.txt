Item 1. Business.
Overview

The Company’s sole activities relate to the activities of Bluegreen, a leading vacation ownership company that markets and sells VOIs and manages resorts in popular leisure and urban destinations. Bluegreen, which was previously a 93% owned subsidiary of the Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in May 2021.

On September 30, 2020, the Company completed its spin-off of BBX Capital, Inc. (“BBX Capital”). BBX Capital was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company prior to the spin-off and became a separate public company as a result 

 
of the spin-off. BBX Capital holds all of the historical business and investments of the Company other than the Company’s investment in Bluegreen. BBX Capital and its subsidiaries are presented as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements.

In connection with the spin-off, the Company’s name was changed from BBX Capital Corporation to Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation. The Company also issued a $75.0 million note payable to BBX Capital (of which $50.0 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2022). The note accrues interest at a rate of 6% per annum and requires payments of interest on a quarterly basis. Under the terms of the note, the Company has the option in its discretion to defer interest payments under the note, with interest on the entire outstanding balance thereafter to accrue at a cumulative, compounded rate of 8% per annum until such time as the Company is current on all accrued payments under the note, including deferred interest. All remaining outstanding amounts under the note will become due and payable in September 2025 or earlier upon the occurrence of certain other events.

On May 5, 2021, the Company acquired approximately 7% of outstanding shares of Bluegreen’s common stock not previously owned by the Company through a statutory short-form merger under Florida law. In connection with the merger, Bluegreen’s shareholders (other than the Company) received 0.51 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock for each share of Bluegreen’s common stock that they held at the effective time of the merger (subject to rounding up of fractional shares). The Company issued approximately 2.66 million shares of its Class A Common Stock in connection with the merger. As a result of the completion of the merger, Bluegreen became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and its common stock was no longer publicly traded.

In July 2020, the Company effected a one-for-five reverse split of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Share and per share amounts set forth herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-five reverse stock split as if it had occurred as of January 1, 2020.

Our Business

Bluegreen is a leading vacation ownership company that markets and sells VOIs and manages resorts in popular leisure and urban destinations. Bluegreen’s resort network includes 46 Club Resorts (resorts in which owners in the Bluegreen Vacation Club (“Vacation Club”) have the right to control and use most of the units in connection with their VOI ownership) and 23 Club Associate Resorts (resorts in which owners in the Vacation Club have the right to use only a limited number of units in connection with their VOI ownership). These Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts are primarily located in high-volume, “drive-to” vacation locations, including Orlando, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Charleston and New Orleans, among others. In addition, in October 2022 Bluegreen purchased a resort located in Panama City Beach, Florida. Bluegreen expects this resort to be available for use by Bluegreen Vacation Club owners in 2023. Through Bluegreen’s points-based system, the approximately 218,000 owners in the Vacation Club have the flexibility to stay at units available at any of Bluegreen’s resorts and have access to over 11,400 other hotels and resorts through partnerships and exchange networks. Bluegreen’s sales and marketing platform is currently supported by marketing relationships with nationally-recognized consumer brands, such as Bass Pro and Choice Hotels. The Company believes these marketing relationships have helped generate sales within its core demographic, as described below.

The Vacation Club has grown from approximately 170,000 owners as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 218,000 owners as of December 31, 2022. The average Vacation Club owner is 48 years old and has an average annual household income of approximately $84,000. According to U.S. census data, households with an annual income of $50,000 to $100,000 represent approximately 28% of the total population. Bluegreen believes its ability to effectively scale the transaction size to suit its customer, as well as its high-quality, conveniently-located, “drive-to” resorts are key factors in attracting its core target demographic. 




(1)Excludes “Other Income, Net”.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions in international and U.S. economies and markets, and had an unprecedented impact on the travel and hospitality industries, including a material adverse impact on Bluegreen’s results, especially during 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, as previously described in the Company’s filings with the SEC. Bluegreen believes that the increase in sales of VOIs in 2022 reflect the recovery from the pandemic and high demand for domestic travel despite ongoing COVID-19 cases and higher interest rates and inflationary trends. While we hope that improvements in the travel and leisure industry continue, the impact of economic challenges and public health concerns on the Bluegreen’s business and operating results is uncertain.

Vacation Ownership Interests

Since entering the vacation ownership industry in 1994, Bluegreen has generated over 807,000 VOI sales transactions. Vacation Club owners receive an annual or biennial allotment of “points” in perpetuity (supported by an underlying deeded VOI held in trust for the owner) that may be used to stay at any of Bluegreen’s Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts. Vacation Club owners can use their points to stay in resorts for varying lengths of time, starting at a minimum of two nights. The number of points required for a stay at a resort depends on a variety of factors, including resort location, size of the unit, vacation season and the days of the week. Under this system, Vacation Club owners can select vacations according to their schedules, space needs and available points. Subject to certain restrictions and fees, Vacation Club owners are typically allowed to carry over any unused points for one year and to “borrow” points from the next year.

Each of Bluegreen’s Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts is managed by an HOA, which is governed by a board of directors or trustees. The board hires a management company to which it delegates many of the responsibilities of the HOA, including landscaping, security, housekeeping, garbage collection, utilities, insurance procurement, laundry and repairs and maintenance. Vacation Club owners pay annual maintenance fees which cover the costs of operating all of the resorts in the Vacation Club system, including fees for real estate taxes and reserves for capital improvements. If a Vacation Club owner does not pay such charges, his or her use rights may be suspended and ultimately terminated, subject to the applicable lender’s first mortgage lien, if any, on such owner’s VOI. Bluegreen provides management services to 50 resorts and the Vacation Club through contractual arrangements with HOAs. Bluegreen has historically had a 100% renewal rate on management contracts from Club Resorts.

The Vacation Club’s points-based platform offers owners significant flexibility. As reflected in the chart below, basic Vacation Club ownership entitles owners to use their points to stay at any of Bluegreen’s Club Resorts and Club 

 
Associate Resorts, as well as to access more than 4,200 resorts available through the Resort Condominiums International, LLC (“RCI”) exchange network. For a nominal annual fee and transaction fees, Vacation Club owners can join and utilize the Traveler Plus program, which enables them to use their points to access an additional 48 direct exchange resorts, and other vacation experiences. Traveler Plus members can also directly use their Vacation Club points for stays in Choice Hotels’ Ascend Hotel Collection properties and Cambria Hotels and other benefits. Overall, there are more than 7,000 hotels in the Choice Hotels network, located in over 40 countries and territories, and Choice Hotels’ brands include the Ascend Hotel Collection, Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Quality Inn, Sleep Inn, Clarion, Clarion Pointe, Cambria Hotels and Suites, MainStay Suites, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn, WoodSpring Suites and Everhome Suites. In addition, Vacation Club owners can convert their Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges points, which can be used for stays in Choice Hotels’ properties. Bluegreen remains focused on providing value to its Vacation Club owners through enhanced product offerings, new resort locations, broader vacation experiences and technological improvements, all designed to increase guest satisfaction. 


Approximately 66% of Vacation Club owners were enrolled in Traveler Plus as of December 31, 2022. 

Vacation Club Resort Locations 
As shown in the map below, Vacation Club resorts are primarily located on the U.S. East Coast and Midwest. The 48 direct-exchange resorts available to Traveler Plus members are concentrated along the West Coast and Hawaii. The Company believes that, together, this provides a broad geographic offering of resorts available to Vacation Club owners. 

 


Vacation Club resorts are primarily “drive-to” resort destinations as approximately 88% of Bluegreen’s Vacation Club owners live within a four-hour drive of at least one resort. Bluegreen resorts are generally located in popular vacation destinations, such as Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, and Nevada, and represent a diverse mix of resort and urban destinations, allowing Vacation Club owners the ability to customize their vacation experience. In addition, Bluegreen expects to offer Vacation Club owners access to our new Panama City Beach resort in 2023.

Bluegreen’s resort network also offers a diverse mix of experiences and accommodations. Unlike some of Bluegreen’s competitors that maintain static brand design standards across resorts and geographies, Bluegreen seeks to design resorts that capture the uniqueness of a particular location. The goal of Bluegreen’s resorts is to offer an authentic experience and connection to the resorts’ unique and varied locations.

Bluegreen resorts typically feature condominium-style accommodations with amenities such as fully equipped kitchens, entertainment centers and in-room laundry appliances. Many resorts feature a clubhouse (including a pool, game room and lounge), hotel-type staff and concierge services.

Bluegreen also owns a 51% interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, which develops, markets and sells VOIs at three premier wilderness-themed resorts adjacent to Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri: The Bluegreen Wilderness Club at Big Cedar, The Cliffs at Long Creek and Paradise Point. The remaining 49% interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations is held by Big Cedar, LLC, an affiliate of Bass Pro. As a result of Bluegreen’s controlling interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations.

(3)This resort is managed by Casa Grande Cooperative Association I, which has contracted with Bluegreen Resorts Management to provide management consulting services to the resort. The services provided by Bluegreen Resorts Management to this resort pursuant to such agreement are similar in nature to, but less extensive than, the services provided by Bluegreen or its subsidiaries to the other resorts listed in the table as “Managed by Bluegreen.” Further, Vacation Club owners can access most of the units at this resort.

(5)In addition to the sales centers identified in the table, Bluegreen also operates a sales center in Memphis, Tennessee.
(6)This resort and sales center are temporarily closed.

As previously described, in addition to resorts listed above, in October 2022, Bluegreen purchased a resort located in Panama City Beach, Florida. Bluegreen expects this resort to be available for use by Bluegreen Vacation Club owners in 2023.

Marketing and Sale of Inventory

VOI sales are typically generated by attracting prospective customers (“guests”) to tour a resort and attend a sales presentation (a “guest tour”). Bluegreen’s sales and marketing platforms utilize a variety of methods to attract prospective customers, drive guest tour flow and sell VOIs in its Vacation Club. Bluegreen utilizes marketing alliances with nationally-recognized brands, which provide access to venues which target consumers generally matching Bluegreen’s core demographic. To a lesser extent, guests are also sourced through programs which generate leads at high-traffic venues and in high-density tourist locations and events, as well as through referrals from existing owners and other guests at Bluegreen’s properties.

Many of Bluegreen’s marketing programs intended to attract prospective customers involve the sale of a discounted vacation package that typically includes a two to three night stay in close proximity to one of Bluegreen’s sales offices and requires participation in a guest tour. Vacation packages may be sold either in retail brick and mortar establishments, such as Bass Pro and Cabela’s stores and malls, through Bluegreen’s call transfer program with Choice, or via telemarketing. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Bluegreen sold approximately 169,000 vacation packages and 25% of its VOI sales were made to guests who had previously purchased a vacation package and attended a guest tour. As of December 31, 2022, Bluegreen had a pipeline of over 165,000 vacation packages sold to new customers. While there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case, prior to the impact of COVID-19 on travel, historically approximately 40% to 42% of vacation packages resulted in guest tours at one of Bluegreen’s 

 
resorts with a sales center within twelve months of purchase. In addition to vacation packages sold to new prospects, as reflected in the discussion above, Bluegreen also sells vacation packages to customers who have already toured and purchased a VOI and have indicated they would tour again. As of December 31, 2022, the pipeline included approximately 16,000 of such packages. There is no assurance that such packages will convert to sales at historical or expected levels. 

Bluegreen Vacations Unlimited (“BVU”), Bluegreen’s wholly-owned subsidiary, has an exclusive marketing agreement through 2024 with Bass Pro, a nationally-recognized retailer of fishing, marine, hunting, camping and sports gear, that provides BVU with the right to market and sell vacation packages at kiosks in Bass Pro’s and Cabela’s retail locations and through other means. The Company believes that Bass Pro has a loyal customer base that strongly matches Bluegreen’s core demographic. 

During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, VOI sales to prospects and leads generated by the agreement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 17%, 19% and 12%, respectively, of VOI sales volume. As of December 31, 2022, Bluegreen was operating marketing kiosks at a total of 129 Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s stores (one new Bass Pro marketing location opened during 2022). In January 2023, as part of a reorganization of certain marketing programs, Bluegreen’s marketing kiosks at 23 Cabela’s stores were changed to unmanned virtual locations.

Bluegreen also has an exclusive strategic relationship with Choice Hotels that involves several areas of its business, including a sales and marketing alliance that enables Bluegreen to leverage Choice Hotels’ brands, customer relationships and marketing channels to sell vacation packages. Vacation packages are sold through customer reservation calls transferred to Bluegreen from Choice Hotels. Bluegreen’s strategic relationship with Choice Hotels began in 2013 and was extended in August 2017 for a 15 year term, with an additional 15-year renewal term thereafter unless either party elects not to renew the arrangement.

The Company believes that its diverse strategic marketing alliances (including those with Bass Pro, Choice Hotels and other local and national marketing programs) provides a potential strategic advantage over certain of its competitors that rely primarily on relationships with their affiliated hotel brands to drive lead generation and new owner growth. The Company’s goal is to identify marketing partners with brands that attract its targeted owner demographic and to build successful marketing relationships with those partners. In addition to the programs described above, Bluegreen may also engage in other local and national marketing programs from time to time. 

In addition to sales to new customers, Bluegreen seeks to sell additional VOI points to its existing Vacation Club owners. These sales generally have lower marketing costs and result in higher operating margins than sales generated through other marketing channels. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, sales to existing Vacation Club owners accounted for 54%, 54% and 64%, respectively, of Bluegreen’s system-wide sales of VOIs. Bluegreen targets a balanced mix of new customer and existing Vacation Club owner sales to support its goal of sustainable long-term growth. While there is no assurance that it will be the case in the future, Bluegreen believes that the variety of its marketing relationships has historically facilitated a healthy mix of new owner sales vs. existing owner sales that compare favorably to its competitors. 

Bluegreen operates 24 sales centers, typically located at or adjacent to Bluegreen’s resorts. As of December 31, 2022, Bluegreen had over 3,400 employees dedicated to VOI sales and marketing. Bluegreen typically utilizes a uniform sales process and offers ongoing training for its sales personnel with the goal of maintaining strict quality control policies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 96% of Bluegreen’s sales were generated from 20 of Bluegreen’s sales centers which focus on both new customer and existing Vacation Club owner sales. Bluegreen’s remaining 4 sales centers are primarily focused on sales to existing Vacation Club owners staying at the respective resort. Bluegreen also utilizes telesales operations to sell VOIs to Vacation Club owners. 

VOI Inventory Sourcing

The Company’s business model is designed to give it potential flexibility to capitalize on opportunities and adapt to changing market environments. The Company has the ability to adjust its targeted mix of sales of Bluegreen owned VOI inventory vs. fee-based owned VOI inventory, sales to new customers vs. existing Vacation Club owners, and cash vs. financed sales. While the Company may pursue opportunities that primarily impact its short-term results, the long-term goal is to achieve sustained growth while maximizing earnings and cash flow. 

Bluegreen Owned VOI Inventory

Bluegreen owned VOI inventory includes VOIs in resorts that Bluegreen has developed or acquired in addition to VOI inventory acquired pursuant to just in time (“JIT”) and secondary market arrangements. Sales of VOIs from Bluegreen owned VOI inventory comprised 86% of system-wide sales of VOIs during the year ended December 31, 2022. Bluegreen holds the notes receivable originated in connection with sales of Bluegreen owned VOI inventory. 

Bluegreen acquires VOI inventory from HOAs and other owners generally on a non-committed basis. These VOIs are typically obtained by the applicable HOA through foreclosure or termination in connection with HOA maintenance fee defaults and from the HOA through the HOA’s exercise of its right of first refusal. In these cases, Bluegreen generally purchases these VOIs at a significant discount to retail price.

Bluegreen also may enter into JIT VOI inventory acquisition agreements with third-party developers that allow Bluegreen to buy VOI inventory in close proximity to when it intends to sell such VOIs

Fee-Based or Third Party Developer Owned VOI Inventory

Bluegreen offers sales and marketing services to third-party developers for a commission. Under these arrangements, which are typically, but not always, entered into on a non-committed basis, Bluegreen sells third-party developers’ VOIs as Vacation Club interests through Bluegreen’s sales and marketing platform. Bluegreen seeks to structure the fee for these services to cover selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Historically, Bluegreen targeted a commission rate of 65% to 75% of the VOI sales price. Sales of third-party developer owned VOIs comprised 14% of system-wide sales of VOIs during the year ended December 31, 2022. Notes receivable originated in connection with sales of third-party developer owned VOIs are held by the third-party developer and, in certain cases, are serviced by Bluegreen for an additional fee. Bluegreen is not at risk for development financing and has no capital requirements, in connections with fee-based inventory, thereby potentially increasing return on invested capital, or ROIC. Bluegreen may also hold the HOA management contract associated with these resorts.
Future VOI Inventory 

The retail value of Bluegreen owned VOI inventory on hand and available for sale fluctuates from period to period due to sales of VOIs, the acquisition of inventory, the development of new VOIs, reacquisition of VOIs through notes receivable defaults, and the acquisition of VOIs through JIT and secondary market arrangements. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Bluegreen owned VOI inventory (excluding units not currently being marketed as VOIs, such as model units) and had access to additional completed VOI inventory through fee-based and JIT arrangements having a retail sales value as follows (dollars are in thousands and represent the then-estimated retail sales value): 

 | As of December 31,
Inventory Source | 2022 | | 2021
Bluegreen owned completed VOI inventory | $ | 1,516,025 | | $ | 1,172,367
Fee-based VOI inventory | | 88,712 | | | 132,266 
Total | $ | 1,604,737 | | $ | 1,304,633


Based on current estimates and expectations, the Company believes this inventory, combined with inventory being developed by Bluegreen or its third-party developer clients, and inventory that it may reacquire in connection with mortgage and maintenance fee defaults, can support its VOI sales at its current levels for approximately four to five years. The Company remains focused on strategically expanding its inventory through acquisitions of new resorts and continued development at certain of its existing resorts over the next several years. The Company intends to continue to evaluate opportunities to develop or acquire VOI inventory in key strategic markets where it identifies growing owner demand and where it currently has or expects to have a significant marketing and sales network. In connection with this strategy, in 2022, the Company purchased resorts in Vail, Colorado and Panama City Beach, Florida. While Bluegreen intends to continue to be flexible in its approach, sales of third-party developer owned VOIs is expected to decrease as a percentage of system-wide sales of VOIs compared to prior years as the Company continues its efforts to increase sales of Bluegreen owned VOIs in the future.

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the estimated retail sales value and cash purchase price of the VOIs Bluegreen acquired through secondary market arrangements were as follows (dollars in thousands): 



 | | Year Ended December 31,
 | | 2022 | | 2021
Estimated retail sales value | ​ | $ | 288,831 | ​ | $ | 210,743
Cash purchase price | ​ | $ | 11,446 | ​ | $ | 5,884 


Active development activities consist primarily of improvements to the Vail and Panama City Beach resorts and additional VOI units being developed in Missouri and Tennessee.

Management and Other Fee-Based Services

The Company earns recurring management fees for providing services to HOAs. These management services include oversight of front desk, housekeeping, maintenance as well as certain accounting and administrative functions. The Company believes its management contracts yield highly predictable cash flows that do not have the traditional risks associated with hotel management contracts that are linked to daily rate or occupancy. Bluegreen’s management contracts are typically structured as “cost-plus” management fees, pursuant to which it generally earns fees equal to 10% to 12% of the costs to operate the applicable resort. These agreements generally have an initial term of three years with automatic one year renewals. As of December 31, 2022, Bluegreen provided management services to 50 resorts. The Company also earns recurring management fees for providing services to the Vacation Club. The services to the Vacation Club include managing the reservation system and providing owner billing and collection services. Bluegreen’s management contract with the Vacation Club currently provides for reimbursement of its costs plus a fee equal to $10 per Vacation Club owner. The Company may seek to expand its management services business, including to provide hospitality management services to hotels for third parties.

In addition to HOA and club management services, the Company also provides other fee-based services that produce revenue without the significant capital investment generally associated with the development and acquisition of resorts. These services include title and escrow services for fees in connection with the closing of VOI sales, servicing notes receivable held by third parties (typically a fee equal to 1.5% of the principal balance of the serviced portfolio), and construction management services for third-party developers (typically fees equal to 4% of the cost of construction of the project). The Company also receives revenue from retail and food and beverage operations at certain resorts.



Customer Financing

The Company generally offers qualified purchasers financing for up to 90% of the purchase price of VOIs. The typical financing provides for a term of ten years and a fixed interest rate that is determined based on the FICO score of the borrower, the amount of the down payment and existing ownership, is fully amortizing in equal installments, and may be prepaid without penalty. Purchasers may receive an additional 1% discount on the interest rate by participating in a pre-authorized payment plan. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 93% of the Bluegreen’s serviced VOI notes receivable participated in the pre-authorized payment plan. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the weighted-average interest rate on the Company’s VOI notes receivable was 15.3%. 

VOI purchasers are generally required to make a down payment or have equity in an existing VOI of at least 10% of the sales price. Bluegreen also promotes a point-of-sale credit card program sponsored by a third-party financial institution. Including down payments received on financed sales, approximately 40% of system-wide sales of VOIs during the year ended December 31, 2022 were paid in cash within approximately 30 days from the contract date.

See “Sales/Financing of Receivables” below for additional information regarding the Company’s receivable financing activities.

Loan Underwriting

The Company generally does not originate financing to customers with FICO scores below 600. However, it may provide financing to customers with no FICO score or a FICO score between 575 and 599 if the customer makes a minimum down payment of 20%. For loans made during 2022, the borrowers’ weighted-average FICO score after a 30-day, “same as cash” period from the point of sale was 728. Further information is set forth in the following table: 

FICO Score | Percentage of originated and‎ serviced VOI receivables
No Score | 1.0% 
<600 | 1.0% 
600 - 699 | 31.0% 
700+ | 67.0% 

Collection Policies

Financed VOI sales originated by the Company utilize a note and mortgage. Collection efforts related to these VOI notes receivable are managed by Bluegreen. Collectors are incentivized through a performance-based compensation program.

Bluegreen generally pursues collection efforts with respect to Vacation Club owners with outstanding loans secured by their VOI by mail, telephone and email (as early as 10 days past due). At 30 days past due, Bluegreen mails a collection letter to the owner if a U.S. resident advising that if the loan is not brought current, the delinquency will be reported to a credit reporting agency. At 60 days past due, Bluegreen mails a letter to the owner advising that he or she may be prohibited from making future reservations for lodging at a resort. At 90 days past due, the Company stops the accrual of, and reverses previously accrued but unpaid, interest on the note receivable and typically mails a notice informing the owner that unless the delinquency is cured within 30 days, Bluegreen may terminate the underlying VOI ownership. If an owner fails to bring the account current within the given timeframe, the loan is generally defaulted and the owner’s VOI is terminated. In that case, Bluegreen mails a final letter, at approximately 127 days past due, notifying the owner of the loan default and the termination of his or her beneficial interest in the VOI property. Thereafter, Bluegreen may seek to resell the VOI to a new purchaser. In certain cases, at its discretion, Bluegreen may not default the loan and terminate the underlying VOI, in which case the loan would remain delinquent.



Allowance for Loan Losses

The Company estimates uncollectible VOI notes receivable based on historical loss amounts for similar VOI notes receivable and does not consider the value of the underlying collateral. The Company holds large pools of homogeneous VOI notes receivable and assesses uncollectibility based on pools of receivables as it does not believe there are significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty or groups of counterparties. In estimating future loan losses, management does not use a single primary indicator of credit quality, but instead evaluates VOI notes receivable based upon a combination of factors, including a static pool analysis that incorporates the aging of the respective receivables, default trends, and prepayment rates by origination year, as well as the FICO scores of borrowers and the mix of new versus existing owner loans.

Substantially all defaulted VOI notes receivable result in the holder of such receivable acquiring the related VOI that secured such receivable, typically soon after default and at little or no cost. The reacquired VOI is then available for resale in the normal course of business.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about the performance of the Company’s notes receivable portfolio.

Sales/Financing of Receivables

The Company’s ability to sell or borrow against its VOI notes receivable is an important factor in meeting its liquidity requirements. The vacation ownership business generally involves sales where a buyer is only required to pay 10% of the purchase price up front, while at the same time selling and marketing expenses related to such sales are primarily cash expenses that exceed the down payment amount. For the year ended December 31, 2022, sales and marketing expenses totaled approximately 57% of system-wide sales of VOIs. Accordingly, having facilities for the sale or hypothecation of VOI notes receivable, along with periodic term securitization transactions, have been critical factors in meeting the Company’s short and long-term cash needs. There are no assurances that sales, hypothecation or securitization of VOIs will be available in the future at acceptable terms or at all. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about the Company’s VOI notes receivable purchase facilities and term securitizations.

Receivables Servicing

Receivables servicing includes collecting payments from borrowers and remitting the funds to the owners, lenders or investors in such receivables, accounting for principal and interest on such receivables, making advances when required, contacting delinquent borrowers, terminating a Vacation Club ownership in the event that defaults are not timely remedied and performing other administrative duties.

The Company receives fees for servicing its securitized notes receivable. These fees are included as a component of interest income. Additionally, the Company earns servicing fee income from third-party developers in connection with its servicing of their loan portfolios under certain fee-based services arrangements, which is netted against the cost of mortgage servicing operations.

Bluegreen’s Core Operating and Growth Strategies
Grow VOI sales

Bluegreen’s goal is to utilize its sales and marketing platform to achieve VOI sales growth through the expansion of existing alliances, continued development of new marketing programs and additional VOI sales to Bluegreen’s existing Vacation Club owners. Bluegreen believes there are a number of opportunities within its existing marketing alliances to drive future growth. In addition to its marketing through Bass Pro, Bluegreen has a marketing program through its Choice Hotels’ call-transfer programs. Further, Bluegreen continues to utilize its sales and marketing expertise to identify additional unique marketing relationships with nationally-recognized brands that resonate with its core demographic. Bluegreen will continue to actively seek to sell additional VOI points to its existing Vacation Club owners, which typically involve significantly lower marketing costs and have higher conversion rates compared to sales to new customers. Bluegreen’s goal continues to be to expand and update its sales offices to more effectively 

 
convert tours generated by its marketing programs into sales. To this end, Bluegreen has focused on identifying high traffic resorts where it believes increased investment in sales office infrastructure will yield strong sales results.

Continue to enhance Bluegreen’s Vacation Club experience

Bluegreen believes its Vacation Club offers owners exceptional value. Bluegreen’s Vacation Club offers owners access to its 46 Club Resorts and 23 Club Associate Resorts in popular vacation destinations, as well as access to over 11,400 other hotels and resorts and other vacation experiences, through partnerships and exchange networks. Bluegreen continues to seek to add value and flexibility to its Vacation Club membership and enhance the vacation experience of its Vacation Club owners, including through the addition of new destinations, the expansion of its exchange programs and the addition of new partnerships offering increased vacation options. Bluegreen also continuously seeks to improve its technology, including websites and applications, to enhance its Vacation Club owners’ experiences. Bluegreen believes these objectives will continue to enhance the Vacation Club experience, supporting Bluegreen’s goal of encouraging guests to vacation and to drive sales to both new and existing owners.

Grow higher-margin, cash generating revenues

Bluegreen also seeks to grow its recurring revenues such as resort management and financing revenues. Bluegreen believes these revenues are generally more predictable and can grow with little additional investment in infrastructure and can potentially produce higher-margins.

Increase sales and operating efficiencies across all customer touch-points

Bluegreen is actively seeking to improve its operational execution across all aspects of its business. Bluegreen’s sales and marketing platform utilizes a variety of screening methods and data-driven analyses intended to identify and attract high-quality prospects to its sales offices in an effort to increase volume per guest (“VPG”), an important measure of sales efficiency. Bluegreen also intends to leverage its size, infrastructure and expertise to increase its operating efficiency and profitability and hopes to gain further operational efficiencies by streamlining its support operations, such as call centers, customer service, administration and information technology. As previously described, during 2022, we acquired resorts in Vail, Colorado and Panama City Beach, Florida. 

Pursue opportunistic strategic transactions

As part of our growth strategy, we may seek to acquire other VOI companies, resorts, sales and marketing platforms, management companies and contracts, and other assets, properties and businesses, particularly where significant synergies and cost savings may be available. We believe Bluegreen’s flexible sales and marketing platform may make these transactions possible in a variety of economic conditions. As previously discussed, during 2022 we acquired resorts in Vail, Colorado and Panama City Beach, Florida.

Industry Overview 

The vacation ownership, or timeshare, industry is a growing segment of the global travel and tourism sector. By purchasing a VOI, the purchaser typically acquires either (i) a fee simple interest in a property (or collection of properties) providing annual usage rights at the owner’s home resort (where the owner’s VOI is deeded), or (ii) an annual or biennial allotment of points that can be redeemed for stays at properties included in the vacation ownership company’s resort network or for other vacation options available through exchange programs. Compared to hotel rooms, vacation ownership units typically offer more spacious floor plans and residential features, such as living rooms, fully equipped kitchens, laundry appliances and dining areas. Compared to owning a vacation home in its entirety, the key advantages of vacation ownership products typically include a lower up-front acquisition cost and annual expenses, resort-style features and services and, often, an established infrastructure to exchange usage rights for stays across multiple locations. 

The vacation ownership industry was historically highly fragmented, with a large number of local and regional resort developers and operators having small resort portfolios of varying quality. The Company believes that the current growth in the vacation ownership industry has been driven by increased interest from resort developers and globally-

 
recognized lodging and entertainment brands, increased interest from consumers seeking flexible vacation options, continued product evolution and geographic expansion.

The average VOI owner is 39 years old and married and 78% have either graduated from or attended college. VOI owners have an average household income of over $95,000. 

Regulation

The vacation ownership and real estate industries are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulation and as a consequence, the Company is subject to various federal, state, local, foreign, environmental, zoning, consumer protection and other laws, rules and regulations, including those regarding the acquisition, marketing and sale of VOIs, as well as various aspects of its financing operations. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken an active regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or unfair competition in interstate commerce. In addition, many states have what are known as “Little FTC Acts” that apply to intrastate activity. 

In addition to the laws applicable to the Company’s customer financing and other operations discussed below, it may be subject to the Fair Housing Act and various other federal laws, rules and regulations. The Company is also subject to various foreign laws with respect to La Cabana Beach Resort and Casino in Oranjestad, Aruba and Blue Water Resort at Cable Beach in Nassau, Bahamas.  The cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations may be significant and while efforts are in place to monitor compliance, those efforts may not at all times be successful. Any failure to comply with current or future applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results and operations. 

The vacation ownership product is subject to various regulatory requirements, including state and local approvals. In most states the Company is required to file with the jurisdictions a detailed offering statement describing its business and all material aspects of the project and sale of VOIs with the designated state authority. In addition, when required by state law, the Company provides its VOI purchasers with a public offering disclosure statement that contains, among other items, detailed information about the VOI product and the purchaser’s rights and obligations as a VOI owner. Laws in each state where the Company sells VOIs generally grant the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract at any time within a specified rescission period following the earlier of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by the Company. Most states have other laws that regulate the Company’s activities, which may include real estate licensure requirements, sellers of travel licensure requirements, anti-fraud laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and labor laws. 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the owner of real property is generally liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, the property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the property owner knew of the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect a property owner’s ability to sell or lease a property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. Other federal and state laws require the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing material when such material is in poor condition or in the event of construction, demolition, remodeling or renovation. Other statutes may require the removal of underground storage tanks. Noncompliance with any of these and other environmental, health or safety requirements may result in the need to cease or alter operations or development at a property. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers including the Company with respect to construction defects discovered on the property or repairs made by future owners of such property. The development, management and operation of Bluegreen’s resorts are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

The Company’s marketing, sales and customer financing activities are also subject to extensive regulation, which can include, but is not limited to: the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z; the Fair Housing Act; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B; the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”); Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Regulation AA; the Patriot Act; the Right to Financial Privacy Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the Fair and Accurate Credit 

 
Transactions Act; and anti-money laundering laws. Pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) was created. The CFPB’s mandate is to protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws and to publish rules and forms that facilitate understanding of the financial implications of the transactions consumers enter into. Consistent with this mission, the CFPB amended Regulations X and Z to establish new disclosure requirements and forms pursuant to Regulation Z for most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The practical impact upon the Company is the requirement to use a new Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Statement in lieu of the separate Good Faith Estimate and Closing Statement. In addition, Bluegreen’s term securitization transactions must comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including risk retention rules. 

Bluegreen’s management of, and dealings with, HOAs, including the purchase of defaulted inventory from HOAs in connection with secondary market arrangements, is subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making and the imposition of maintenance assessments. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 3% of VOI sales were generated by marketing to prospective purchasers obtained through internal and third-party vendors’ outbound telemarketing efforts. The Company attempts to monitor the actions and legal and regulatory compliance of these third parties, but there are risks associated with the Company’s and such third parties’ telemarketing efforts. State and federal regulators have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring the adherence to state “do not call” laws. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission have implemented national “do not call” legislation. The Company has attempted to mitigate the risks associated with telemarketing through the use of “permission based marketing,” whereby the Company obtains the permission of prospective purchasers to contact them in the future, thereby exempting such calls from the various “do not call” laws. The Company has also implemented policies and procedures that it believes reduce the possibility that individuals who have requested to be placed on a “do not call” list are not contacted, but such policies and procedures ensure strict regulatory compliance. 

To date, no material fines or penalties have been imposed as a result of the Company’s telemarketing operations. However, the Company and its subsidiaries have been the subject of proceedings for violation of the telemarketing laws and other laws applicable to the marketing and sale of VOIs. See “Note 12 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.” 

Competition 

The Company competes with various high profile and well-established companies, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources. Many of the world’s most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell VOIs in resort properties. Major companies that now operate vacation ownership resorts directly, through subsidiaries or through strategic relationships include Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, Hilton Grand Vacations, and Travel + Leisure Co. The Company also competes with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. The Company’s ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on its customers’ satisfaction with its products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of its products and services from those offered by its competitors. 
Seasonality 

The Company has historically experienced, and expects to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations. This seasonality has resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Due to consumer travel patterns, the Company typically experiences more tours and higher VOI sales volume during the second and third quarters. 
Human Resources

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 5,924 employees, 558 of whom were assigned at its headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. As of December 31, 2022, a total of 30 of the Company’s employees were covered by two collective bargaining agreements which address the terms and conditions of their employment, including pay rates, working hours, certain employee benefits and procedures for settlement of labor disputes. The Company believes that its employee relations are good. 

The performance of the Company’s employees is important to achievement of the Company’s business objectives. The Company seeks to offer market competitive compensation and benefit programs for its employees in an effort to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include incentive compensation plans, including long-term incentive plans, a company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, a tuition assistance program, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.

The Company is committed to fostering an inclusive work environment that supports its workforce and the communities it serves. It is the Company’s policy to seek to hire the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected characteristics and to fully comply with all laws relating to discrimination in the workplace.
