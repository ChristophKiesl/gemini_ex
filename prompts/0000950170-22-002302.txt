Overview
 We are a clinical-stage precision oncology biopharmaceutical company designing and developing novel therapies that target genetic drivers of cancer to improve the lives of patients. We have developed a macrocycle platform from which we designed our current pipeline of proprietary small, compact tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with rigid structures that have the potential to bind to their targets with greater precision and affinity than other kinase inhibitors. Our drug discovery approach integrates tumor biology with structure-based drug design to develop a new generation of orally available proprietary agents that we believe will have the potential to address important unmet medical needs for patients.
 Repotrectinib
Our lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial called TRIDENT-1 for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted repotrectinib breakthrough therapy designations for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI and for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion who have progressed following treatment with one or two prior TRK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with or without prior chemotherapy, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments. In addition, the FDA has granted repotrectinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology; and four fast track designations for the treatment of patients with: (1) NTRK+ advanced solid tumors who have been previously treated with one prior line of chemotherapy and one or two prior TRK TKIs; (2) ROS1+advanced NSCLC who have been previously treated with one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and one prior line of a ROS1 TKI; (3) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a ROS1 TKI; and (4) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC who have been previously treated with one prior ROS1 TKI and who have not received prior platinum-based chemotherapy.
Our multi-cohort Phase 2 registrational portion of TRIDENT-1 is ongoing at sites in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions. The Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 is a registrational trial for potential approval in ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. In the second quarter of 2021 we reached enrollment of 50 patients pooled from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the TRIDENT-1 study in EXP-1 and in the first quarter of 2022 we reached enrollment of 60 patients from the Phase 2 portion of the TRIDENT-1 study in EXP-4. Enrollment is ongoing in all cohorts in the study. We anticipate reporting topline blinded independent central review (BICR) data from all of the ROS1+ NSCLC cohorts from TRIDENT-1 and discussing the BICR data with the FDA at a pre-new drug application (NDA) meeting, in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to discuss available BICR data in at least 50 TKI-naïve and 50 TKI-pretreated patients with at least six months of follow-up for the majority of responders. We also anticipate reporting additional data from patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors in the second half of 2022. We plan to request a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss topline BICR results from 40 NTRK+ TKI pre-treated patients (EXP-6) and BICR data from NTRK+ TKI naive patients (EXP-5) enrolled at that time (estimated at approximately 40 patients of the targeted 55 patients) when responders have been followed for at least six months past onset of response. We plan to provide guidance on the timing of our anticipated pre-NDA
meeting for repotrectinib in patients with NTRK-positive advanced solid tumors after completion of enrollment of the targeted 40 EXP-6 patients is achieved.
In addition to the TRIDENT-1 study, we are also conducting our Phase 1/2 CARE study of repotrectinib in pediatric and young adult patients with ALK+, ROS1+ or NTRK+ advanced solid tumors and our Phase 1b/2 TRIDENT-2 study of repotrectinib in combination with trametinib in KRAS mutant G12Dadvanced solid tumors.
Elzovantinib (TPX-0022)
 Elzovantinib, our MET/SRC/CSF1R inhibitor, is currently being evaluated in our ongoing Phase 1 SHIELD-1 clinical trial, in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in MET. The FDA has granted elzovantinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of gastric cancer, including gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and fast track designation for the treatment of patients with MET amplified advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma after prior chemotherapy. Our Phase 1 SHIELD-1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the overall safety profile, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of elzovantinib and includes a dose-finding portion followed by dose expansion in multiple cohorts of MET alterations and tumor types.
We are currently evaluating a 60 mg QD to 60 mg BID intermediate dose level in the dose escalation portion of SHIELD-1 and continuing to enroll patients in the Phase 1 dose expansion portion of the study at 40 mg QD to 40 mg BID. We anticipate providing a clinical data update from the Phase 1 SHIELD-1 study in the second half of 2022. We also anticipate initiating the planned Phase 2 portion of SHIELD-1 in the second half of 2022 pending feedback from the FDA on data from the intermediate dose level and determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose.
 In October 2021 we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with EQRx, Inc. (EQRx) to evaluate elzovantinib in combination with aumolertinib (EQ143), EQRx’s drug candidate targeting EGFR, in patients with EGFR mutant MET-amplified advanced NSCLC. Our investigational new drug (IND) submission for our planned Phase 1b/2 SHIELD-2 combination study of elzovantinib and aumolertinib was cleared by the FDA in January 2022 and we anticipate initiating the study in mid-2022. Preclinical data suggest the combination of MET and EGFR inhibition has the potential to increase anti-tumor activity based on complementary mechanisms. It is estimated that 15% to 20% of patients who progress on a first-line EGFR inhibitor develop MET amplification as the basis of acquired resistance.
 TPX-0046
The Phase 1 dose-finding portion of our Phase 1/2 SWORD-1 clinical trial of our RET inhibitor, TPX-0046 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring RET genetic alterations is ongoing at sites in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions. The trial is designed to enroll TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients with RET-altered non-small-cell lung, thyroid, and other advanced cancers in multiple cohorts to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary clinical activity of TPX-0046, in a Phase 1 dose finding portion, followed by multiple Phase 1 dose expansion cohorts after determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose. We are continuing to evaluate multiple doses and schedules to further characterize the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy profile of TPX-0046 before determining the recommended Phase 2 dose.
 TPX-0131
 Our fourth drug candidate, TPX-0131, is a next-generation ALK inhibitor. TPX-0131 has been designed with a compact macrocyclic structure and in preclinical studies has been shown to potently inhibit wildtype ALK and numerous ALK mutations, in particular the clinically observed G1202R solvent front mutation, L1196M gatekeeper mutation and G1202R/L1196M compound mutation. Additionally, preclinical in vivo studies have shown that TPX-0131 has significant brain tissue penetration after repeat oral dosing supporting the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier.
We initiated our Phase 1/2 FORGE-1 study of TPX-0131 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TKI-pretreated ALK-positive NSCLC in the second quarter of 2021. The study endpoints include safety and tolerability, determination of the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose, and objective response rate by RECIST 1.1. We anticipate providing early interim data from initial patients treated in the dose-finding portion of the FORGE-1 study in the fourth quarter of 2022 or early 2023.
 Discovery Platform

Our macrocycle platform is the foundation of our current development pipeline where we applied novel small molecule design approaches integrating tumor biology and structure-based drug design to develop a new generation of orally available proprietary TKIs that we believe will have the ability to maintain or enhance inhibition of the targeted kinase in both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients. Our approach to the discovery of new and potentially differentiated drug candidates is to use a methodology anchored by our structure-based drug design expertise, coupled with a disciplined chemistry approach and enabling biology. We anticipate our internal and external exploration of oncology candidates will continue to include kinase targets and other oncogenic signaling proteins and pathways that address high unmet medical need. We currently have four internal discovery programs targeting aberrant GTPase signaling known to drive genomically defined cancers with significant unmet medical need. The most advanced programs target KRAS G12D and the p21 activated kinase, or “PAK” family. We are targeting the identification of two development candidates in the second half of 2022 with a goal to achieve at least one new IND per year beginning in 2023. We anticipate providing details on our other two GTPase signaling discovery programs in the second half of 2022.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 We have experienced disruptions to our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the continued evolving and uncertain global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the omicron variant and future potential variants, we cannot precisely determine or quantify the impact this pandemic will have on our ongoing business, operations and financial performance. For our ongoing and planned clinical trials, while we anticipate and have experienced some temporary delays or disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular with respect to activation of additional clinical trial sites and patient enrollment we continue to work closely with our contract research organizations (CROs) and clinical sites as we navigate and seek to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our clinical studies and current timelines. Measures we have taken in response to COVID-19, include where feasible, conducting remote clinical trial site activations and data monitoring, enabling patients to have routine tests conducted closer to home, allowing trial sites to evaluate certain patients remotely, in compliance with their local procedures, and direct-to-patient study drug shipping. In addition, we believe our current supply and plans for supply will be sufficient to meet our anticipated clinical development needs for our drug candidates through 2022. However, depending on the length and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and available manufacturing capacity at our suppliers, our suppliers could be adversely impacted, which may result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain.
We will continue to assess the duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existing and potential impacts on our business, operations and financial performance, and we will continue to work closely with our third-party vendors, CROs, collaborators and other parties in order to seek to advance our drug candidates as quickly as possible, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority. Please refer to our Risk Factors in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report for further discussion of risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to focus on the design, development and commercialization of novel targeted therapies to address unmet medical needs, with the potential to be best-in-class. Key elements of our strategy include:
 •Rapidly develop our lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors, including those with central nervous system (CNS) disease or CNS metastases and seek global regulatory approvals.
 •Expand the market opportunity for repotrectinib by pursuing combination therapies.
 •Leverage our extensive expertise in structure-based drug design to expand our pipeline of targeted drug candidates and to develop our candidates as single agent therapies and/or in combinations.
 •Evaluate strategic opportunities to accelerate development timelines, enhance the commercial potential of our drug candidates, and expand and optimize our clinical and preclinical pipeline.
 •Establish capabilities to effectively commercialize our drug candidates, including by building a targeted, specialty sales force in North America to support the commercialization of repotrectinib and our other drug candidates, if approved.

Overview of Kinases and Current Limitations of Kinase Inhibitors
 Kinases are enzymes that respond to external stimuli to modulate numerous activities of cells, such as proliferation, survival and migration. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is utilized by kinases for phosphorylation, which triggers a signaling process. This phosphorylation process changes a kinase from an inactive conformation (unphosphorylated kinase) to an active conformation (phosphorylated kinase). A kinase often undergoes substitutions of its original amino acids by other amino acids, also known as a mutation. Kinases maintain a controlled equilibrium between the active and inactive conformations, but activating mutations shift the kinase to favor the active conformation, which can lead to aberrant cell proliferation and thus the development of certain cancers. Aberrant activation of a kinase can also occur if the kinase gene, such as ROS1, NTRK or ALK, undergoes a genomic rearrangement resulting in fusion to another gene, leading to the constitutive phosphorylation of the fusion kinase and the development of certain cancers.
Kinase inhibitors are designed to occupy the ATP binding site, thereby preventing the binding of ATP. Most conventional kinase inhibitors are much larger than ATP and have extra motifs that extend beyond the ATP pocket of the kinase in order to enable the kinase to have a stronger interaction with the compound than with ATP. During treatment with conventional TKIs, an acquired mutation in the kinase domain often occurs. These mutations change the surface of the kinase and block the occupancy of oversized TKIs at the ATP binding site without impacting the binding of ATP. Two or more mutations in the same protein are referred to as compound mutations.
 Based on the orientation of the extra motif, kinase inhibitors can be grouped into two types:
•Type I kinase inhibitors, such as Xalkori (crizotinib), which often have the extra motif extending to the kinase’s open solvent front area. The most common treatment acquired resistance to these inhibitors are solvent front mutations.
 •Type II kinase inhibitors, such as Gleevec (imatinib), which have the extra motif extending to the back pocket of the kinase. The most common treatment acquired resistance to these inhibitors are gatekeeper mutations.
 TKIs have become an important class of cancer therapies due to their ability to interrupt deregulated kinase signaling that leads to unchecked cell growth and tumor progression. Since 2001, the FDA has approved nearly 50 TKIs for the treatment of cancers. In 2020, TKIs represented approximately $30 billion in worldwide drug sales. Despite the success of this drug class, there remains a significant opportunity for a new generation of TKIs that address the shortcomings of current therapies. These shortcomings include the inability to achieve a response or limited durability of response caused by intrinsic or acquired resistance, and toxicities that limit dosage levels and duration of treatment. Many conventional kinase inhibitors are oversized, with bulky side groups and limited chemical structure diversity, and some are associated with safety issues such as QT prolongation (abnormal electrocardiography) and hepatotoxicity (liver damage). Further, the same class of kinase inhibitors often share many binding similarities and therefore often cannot be sequentially administered to effectively overcome common treatment resistant mutations.
 Our Approach
 Our macrocycle platform is the foundation of our current development pipeline where we applied novel small molecule design approaches integrating tumor biology and structure-based drug design to develop a new generation of orally available proprietary TKIs that we believe will have the ability to maintain or enhance inhibition of the targeted kinase in both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients. Our strategy in developing our current development pipeline was to design small (low molecular weight), compact TKIs with rigid macrocyclic structures that bind deeply in the ATP pocket of the target kinase. By binding deeply inside the ATP pocket, our TKIs maintain their potency and avoid solvent front mutations that sterically exclude conventional TKIs. In addition to potentially addressing resistance from prior lines of TKI therapy, we believe our TKIs may also prevent or delay the emergence of new resistant mutations. Furthermore, unlike conventional, flat kinase inhibitor structures, we believe a rigid structure with greater 3D topology enables our TKIs to target the selected kinases in a highly potent, precise and efficient manner, which provides a base for a favorable kinase selectivity profile. Our approach to the discovery of potentially new and differentiated drug candidates is to use a methodology anchored by our structure-based drug design expertise, coupled with a disciplined chemistry approach and enabling biology. This approach is uniquely suited to address the therapeutically important family of GTPase enzymes which include key oncogenic signaling proteins such as KRAS. We are applying our novel structure-based expertise to exploit protein-protein interactions and specific stereoelectronic ligand-protein interactions, as well as more conventional inhibitor approaches. Our strategy is to study our current and future potential pipeline drug candidates as both single agents and in combinations that are supported by strong biologic rationale for synergy between the combined agents, while focusing on key areas of unmet medical need.

As a precision oncology company, we seek to identify actionable targets from the molecular profiling of tumors and develop drug candidates with the potential to become best-in-class targeted therapies. Under this approach, well-documented or novel genomic alterations may be targeted to more precisely treat a range of solid tumors, including multiple variations of non-small cell lung cancer. Precision medicine is supported by advances in molecular diagnostic testing and next generation sequencing, which have enhanced the ability of physicians to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from targeted therapies. In addition, molecular targets have been shown to develop resistance over time, creating an opportunity for the development of new therapeutic options to evolve treatment paradigms.
Our Pipeline
 We are leveraging our macrocycle platform and applying our expertise in structure-based drug design to develop a pipeline of highly potent proprietary drug candidates that we believe have the potential to be best-in-class. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our drug candidates, other than the rights licensed to Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (Zai) for repotrectinib and elzovantinib in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, the Zai Territory). The following chart summarizes our product pipeline.

Biomarker frequency based on published literature.
 Repotrectinib
We are developing our lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, an orally administered TKI, for the treatment of both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients with ROS1+advanced NSCLC and NTRK+advanced solid tumors. Repotrectinib is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial called TRIDENT-1 for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The multi-cohort registrational portion of TRIDENT-1 is ongoing at sites in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. The FDA has granted repotrectinib breakthrough therapy designations for the treatment of patients with ROS1+ metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI and for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion who have progressed following treatment with one or two prior TRK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, with or without prior chemotherapy, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments. In addition, the FDA has granted repotrectinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology; and four fast track designations for the treatment of patients with: (1) NTRK+ advanced solid tumors who have been previously treated with one prior line of chemotherapy and one or two prior TRK TKIs; (2) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC who have been previously treated with one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and one prior line of a ROS1 TKI; (3) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a ROS1 TKI; and (4) ROS1+ advanced NSCLC who have been previously treated with one prior ROS1 TKI and who have not received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for repotrectinib, other than the rights licensed to Zai in the Zai Territory.
 There are currently two approved TKIs for each of the patient populations targeted by repotrectinib. Xalkori (crizotinib) and Rozlytrek (entrectinib) are approved for patients with metastatic ROS1+ NSCLC, and Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) and Rozlytrek (entrectinib) have received accelerated approval for patients with metastatic solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion (NTRK+ advanced solid tumors) without a known acquired resistant mutation. Existing TKIs can show susceptibility to acquired mutations, and toxicities that can limit duration of treatment. In addition, crizotinib has limited activity within the CNS. There continues to be a high unmet medical need to develop novel therapies that can overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance, treat brain metastases, and prolong duration of response (DOR), with a more tolerable overall safety profile.
 Repotrectinib is a small (low molecular weight), macrocyclic TKI of ROS1, TRK, and ALK. Repotrectinib was designed to efficiently bind with the active kinase conformation and avoid steric interference from a variety of clinically resistant mutations, especially the solvent front and gatekeeper mutations of the ROS1 and TRK kinases. Repotrectinib has a rigid structure and is smaller than currently approved ROS1, TRK and ALK inhibitors. The rigid structure enables repotrectinib to precisely and efficiently bind to its oncogenic targets with a desirable selectivity profile. We believe the inhibition of JAK2, SRC and FAK may lead to a longer DOR for patients treated with repotrectinib.
TRIDENT-1 Phase 1/2 Trial
The Phase 1, dose escalation portion of TRIDENT-1, included three parts: Phase 1a (completed, n=44); Phase 1b (completed, n=28); and Phase 1c (completed, n=21). In June 2019, we initiated the Phase 2 registrational portion of TRIDENT-1, a single-arm clinical trial in patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of TRIDENT-1 was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and a recommended Phase 2 dose of repotrectinib. The safety endpoints of the Phase 1 portion included evaluating the DLTs and adverse events. The secondary endpoint of the Phase 1 portion was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent radiology review (BICR), using RECIST 1.1.
Key inclusion criteria include: histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (Stage IV, as classified by AJCC v.7) that harbor an ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene fusion determined by local testing; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1 (able to conduct full (0) or light (1) daily activities); Age ≥18; prior chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy permitted; at least one measurable target lesion (including CNS only) according to RECIST 1.1. Key exclusion criteria include: symptomatic brain metastases; major cardiovascular history in the past six months; or history of prolonged QTc interval.
Solid tumors are measured by CT or MRI scan, as assessed according to RECIST 1.1, at baseline, at the end of the second cycle, after every two cycles up to cycle 18, and then every three cycles up to cycle 36. If an initial response is determined, confirmation of response requires a subsequent CT or MRI scan, generally four weeks later.
The ongoing Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 is our single-arm clinical trial in patients to support the registration of repotrectinib in patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The trial is evaluating repotrectinib as a single agent at the recommended Phase 2 dose and is enrolling patients across six patient expansion cohorts with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC (EXP-1, EXP-2, EXP-3 and EXP-4), and NTRK+ advanced solid tumors (EXP-5 and EXP-6). The trial design for the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 is illustrated in the following figure.

   The TRIDENT-1 protocol is being amended to increase the sample size in each of the Phase 2 cohorts to allow for continued access to patients, to a total enrollment across all of the cohorts of approximately 620 patients.
 All patients in the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 receive repotrectinib orally at a starting dose of 160 mg QD for the first 14 days of treatment, after which the dose may be increased to 160 mg BID based on patient tolerability, for 28 consecutive days in repeated four-week cycles. The primary objective is to determine the confirmed ORR based on BICR as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Patients are evaluated by either CT or MRI every two cycles and responses will be confirmed approximately four weeks after initial response determination. A CT or MRI scan will be performed at the end of treatment. Patients are able to continue treatment after documented disease progression, provided the patient is deriving clinical benefit. Patients discontinuing study treatment will enter the survival follow-up period and remain on trial until death, loss of follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. The key secondary objectives of the trial include intracranial tumor response and DOR.
 Preliminary Clinical Data From TRIDENT-1
 Phase 1 Data
 In September 2019, we reported preliminary safety, tolerability and efficacy data with repotrectinib in patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC, utilizing the July 22, 2019 data cutoff, with a median follow-up of 20.1 months (range: 5.3 to 24.9+). As of the July 22, 2019 data cut-off, a total of 93 patients had been dosed, 23 patients were still on treatment, and the MTD had not been reached. Of the 93 patients, 40 of 52 with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC and five of 10 with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors were evaluable by BICR. All patients received at least one dose of repotrectinib across nine dose cohorts ranging from 40 mg QD to 200 mg BID.
 The median age of these 40 ROS1+ advanced NSCLC evaluable patients was 57.0 years (range, 30 to 79), 65% were female, and 53% were Asian. CNS metastases were reported in 20 (50%) at baseline. The median number of prior ROS1 TKIs in the 29 (73%) pretreated patients was one (range, one to three). Of the 29 patients, 18 were treated with one prior TKI (of which 12 were treated with crizotinib), seven were treated with two prior TKIs, and four were treated with three prior TKIs. There were 34 (85%) patients treated with at least one prior chemotherapy.
•TKI-naïve ROS1+ advanced NSCLC evaluable population (n=11):
 oconfirmed ORR by BICR of 91% (10/11) (95% CI: 59–100) with a median DOR of 23.1 months (95% CI: 5.6–NR) (based on Kaplan-Meier estimation). The probability of patients with a DOR ≥ 9 months, ≥ 12 months and ≥ 18 months was 78%, 65%, and 65%, respectively. Also, repotrectinib showed a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 24.6 months (95% CI: 7.2–NR). The clinical benefit rate, including those 

who achieved stable disease for at least two cycles or a confirmed partial or complete response, was 100% (11/11) (95% CI, 72 to 100).
othree patients had measurable CNS metastases, and of the three patients, the confirmed IC-ORR was 100% (3/3) (95% CI, 29 to 100), with all three patients with measurable CNS metastases also achieving a confirmed extracranial response. Of these three patients, two remained in a response 14.8+ and 17.6+ months at the time of the data cut-off and one patient progressed at 23.1 months but remained on treatment for 25.7+ months at the time of the data cut-off.
•TKI-pretreated ROS1+ advanced NSCLC evaluable population (n=29, which includes patients with up to three prior TKIs):
 oIn ROS1+ advanced NSCLC patients treated with one prior TKI, the confirmed ORR was 39% (7/18) (95% CI, 17 to 64). At our Phase 2 dose of 160 mg QD or above, 55% (6/11) of patients previously treated with one prior ROS1 TKI achieved a confirmed PR. Additionally, 57% (4/7) of patients previously treated with one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and one prior ROS1 TKI at our Phase 2 dose of 160 mg QD or above achieved a confirmed PR.
oOf the seven patients treated with two prior TKIs, two (29%) (95% CI, 4 to 71) achieved a confirmed PR.
 oAt the time of the data cut-off, of the nine responders within the ROS1+ TKI pretreated patient population, two patients had DORs of 4.4 and 13.0 months and despite progression, remained on treatment for 21.2 and 22.0 months, respectively. Two patients were censored early despite remaining in response at the time of discontinuing treatment (one due to clinical progression and one due to withdrawal of consent). The remaining five patients have DORs ranging from 3.7+ months to 11.1 months and remained on treatment ranging from 5.5+ months to 19.3+ months.
 oFour out of five TKI-pretreated patients with measurable CNS disease at baseline were treated with one prior TKI and the confirmed IC-ORR in these patients was 75% (3/4) (95% CI, 19 to 99), with 80% (4/5) of patients treated with any number of prior TKIs showing tumor regressions. 
 •Of the 40 evaluable patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC who received treatment with repotrectinib, 45% (18/40) remained on treatment as of the July 22, 2019 data cut-off. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was radiologic or clinical disease progression (18 patients). Two patients discontinued repotrectinib due to an adverse event; one was a DLT of Grade 3 hypoxia and dyspnea at a dose of 160 mg BID and the other was a patient with ROS1+ NSCLC initially treated at 120 mg QD who escalated to 160 mg BID due to disease progression 30 days prior to the event of Grade 5 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) of respiratory failure reported as related to disease progression and not treatment related. 
 •Repotrectinib was generally well tolerated. The most frequent TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2. The TEAEs reported in >25% of patients were dizziness (58%), dysgeusia (48%), anemia (30%), fatigue (30%), constipation (30%), dyspnea (29%), and paresthesia (29%). There were few Grade 3 treatment-related AEs (anemia (n=3); dizziness (n=3); and dyspnea, hypophosphatemia, hypoxia, lymphopenia, pleural effusion, syncope and weight increase (all n=1)), and no Grade 4 treatment-related AEs or cases of dizziness leading to treatment discontinuation.
 Data Presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2020 World Conference on Lung Cancer
 On January 29, 2021, we reported preliminary interim efficacy data from the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1, utilizing a December 31, 2020 data cutoff, in 15 ROS1+ TKI-naïve NSCLC patients, who had at least 2 post-baseline scans evaluated by physician assessment, pooled with 7 patients from the Phase 1 portion of the study dosed at or above the Phase 2 dose. The interim safety update included a total of 185 patients from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the study utilizing an October 30, 2020 cutoff date.
 As of the December 31, 2020 cutoff date:
•14 of 15 patients treated in the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 achieved a confirmed ORR of 93% (95% CI: 68-100). At the time of the data cutoff, the one non-responder remained on treatment, and in stable disease with a 13% 

tumor reduction. In addition, one of the 14 patients in a partial response at the time of the data cutoff date has since achieved a confirmed complete response.
 •Duration of response ranged from 1.25+ to 7.4+ months, and the duration of treatment ranged from 3.7+ to 10.9+ months with 14 of the 15 patients remaining on treatment.
 •20 of 22 patients pooled from Phase 1 and Phase 2 achieved a confirmed ORR of 91% (95% CI: 71-99). In the 7 patients from the Phase 1 portion dosed at or above the Phase 2 dose, duration of treatment ranged from 10.9 to 37.3 months with a median of 30.9 months, with 4 patients receiving treatment for longer than 30 months. 2 of the 7 patients remained on treatment as of the data cutoff.
    

As of November 29, 2021, the DOR for six responder patients among a total of seven patients in the Phase 1 portion of TRIDENT-1 who were treated at or above the recommended Phase 2 dose, ranged from 5.6 to 42.2+ months with three patients who had DOR of greater than 30 months. DOR was calculated using BICR assessments as of the data cut-off date of July 22, 2019 followed by physician assessments as of the data cut-off date of November 29, 2021. Duration of treatment for the seven patients ranged from 10.9 to 45.8+ months with four out of seven patients remaining on treatment for greater than three years as of the data cut-off date of November 29, 2021.
 Phase 1 and Phase 2 Interim Safety Data as of October 30, 2020
•In 185 patients treated in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the TRIDENT-1 study, repotrectinib was generally well tolerated with most treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) reported as Grade 1 or 2. 
 •TEAEs found in greater than 15 percent of patients were dizziness (58%), dysgeusia (43%), constipation (32%), dyspnea (31%), fatigue (27%), paresthesia (25%), anemia (22%), nausea (20%) and muscular weakness (16%). 
 •There were 4 cases of Grade 3 dizziness (2%); and no cases of dizziness have led to treatment discontinuation. Dose modifications due to TEAEs were infrequent, including 18% that led to dose reduction and 9% that led to drug discontinuation.
•There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 TRAEs.
 In October 2021, we reported updated preliminary data from the TRIDENT-1 study from ROS1+ TKI pretreated advanced NSCLC cohorts (EXP-2, EXP-3 and EXP-4) and from NTRK+ advanced solid tumor cohorts (EXP-5 and EXP-6).

The updated Phase 2 TRIDENT-1 dataset utilized an August 26, 2021 data cutoff. The safety analysis includes 301 treated patients from the pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of TRIDENT-1 across all cohorts. Phase 2 patients included in the efficacy analysis had baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline evaluable scan or were off treatment prior to first post-baseline scan. Responses were confirmed with a subsequent scan at least 28 days later per RECIST 1.1 and were determined by physician assessment for Phase 2 patients. Phase 1 patients included in the efficacy analysis were treated at or above the Phase 2 dose, with responses assessed by BICR. The Phase 1 data cutoff date was July 22, 2019 for responses and August 26, 2021 for duration of treatment.
 Pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 Preliminary Efficacy Analysis in ROS1+ TKI pretreated advanced NSCLC cohorts (EXP-2, EXP-3 and EXP-4) (n=72)
 •In the ROS1+ advanced NSCLC population pretreated with one prior TKI and prior platinum-based chemotherapy (EXP-2: n=23), the confirmed ORR was 39% (95% CI: 20-61). Duration of response ranged from 1.8+ to 11.1 months, and the duration of treatment in the 23 patients ranged from 0.7 to 44.5+ months with five patients remaining on treatment.
 •In the ROS1+ advanced NSCLC population pretreated with two prior TKIs without prior chemotherapy (EXP-3: n=10), the confirmed ORR was 30% (95% CI: 7-65). Duration of response ranged from 1.9+ to 12.9+ months, and the duration of treatment in the 10 patients ranged from 0.5 to 18.1+ months with two patients remaining on treatment.
 •In the ROS1+ advanced NSCLC population pretreated with one prior TKI without prior chemotherapy (EXP-4: n=39), the confirmed ORR was 38% (95% CI: 23-55).

Duration of response ranged from 0.8+ to 15.0+ months, and the duration of treatment in the 39 patients ranged from 0.5 to 19.2+ months with 21 patients remaining on treatment.
 •Across EXP-2, EXP-3 and EXP-4, 18 patients (25%) had a ROS1 resistance mutation detected, 15 of which had G2032R solvent front mutations (SFMs). The confirmed ORR was 50% (95% CI: 26-74) in 18 patients with any resistance mutation and 53% (95% CI: 27-79) in patients with a G2032R SFM which included two complete responses (CRs). 
 Pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 Preliminary Efficacy Analysis in the NTRK-positive advanced solid tumor cohorts (EXP-5, EXP-6) (n=40)
 •In the NTRK+ TKI-naïve advanced solid tumor population (EXP-5: n=17), the confirmed ORR was 41% (95% CI: 18-67). At the time of the data cutoff, three patients with limited time on treatment achieved stable disease with tumor regression of -21%, -23%, and -27% on their first post-baseline scans, and were awaiting their next scans. Duration of response ranged from 1.9+ to 7.4+ months, and the duration of treatment in the 17 patients ranged from 0.9 to 30.7+ months.
 •In the NTRK+ TKI-pretreated advanced solid tumor population (EXP-6: n=23), the confirmed ORR was 48% (95% CI: 27-69). As of the cutoff date, three patients had uPRs. Two uPRs has been confirmed since the cutoff date and are included in the confirmed ORR of 48%; the third patient with a uPR was on treatment awaiting a confirmatory scan and is not considered a responder in the confirmed ORR. Duration of response ranged from 0.9+ to 15.1 months, and the duration of treatment in the 23 patients ranged from 0.6 to 20.8 months.
 •Of the 23 NTRK+ TKI-pretreated advanced solid tumor patients, 13 (57%) had NTRK solvent front mutations. In these 13 patients, the confirmed ORR was 62% (95% CI: 32-86) including one patient who had a complete response. As of the cutoff date, three patients had uPRs. Two uPRs have been confirmed since the cutoff date and are included in the confirmed ORR; the third patient with a uPR was on treatment awaiting a confirmatory scan and is not considered a responder in the confirmed ORR. Duration of response ranged from 0.9+ to 13.7 months. 
 Preliminary Safety Analysis (n=301)
 •Repotrectinib was generally well tolerated.

•The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was low-grade dizziness (60%) of which 76% of reported cases were Grade 1. 11 patients (4%) reported ataxia in the absence of dizziness. No events of dizziness or ataxia led to treatment discontinuation.
 •Dose modifications due to TEAEs included 27% of patients who had dose reduction and 11% who had drug discontinuation.
 Repotrectinib Regulatory Status
 In December 2018, we completed an End of Phase 1 Meeting with the FDA during which we received feedback on TRIDENT-1 and guidance on the design of the Phase 2 portion:
 •EXP-1. The current single-arm design could support either accelerated or standard approval. A minimum duration of follow up of at least 12 months from the onset of response for all responding patients would be required to support standard approval.
 •EXP-2. The current single-arm design could support accelerated approval in the context of available therapy at the time of submission.
 •EXP-3 and EXP-4. These cohorts have been revised since the End of Phase 1 Meeting with the FDA.
 •EXP-5 and EXP-6. The current single-arm design could support approval with a minimum of five distinct tumor types evaluated. A minimum duration of follow up of at least 12 months from the onset of response for all responding patients would be required.
 •Potential approval by the FDA will be based on the totality of the evidence related to ORR and DOR, as well as overall risk-benefit assessment in the context of available therapy. 
 In August 2020, we reported additional feedback received from the FDA, and modifications we have since made to the TRIDENT-1 study design, that may provide a faster path to potential approval for repotrectinib. The FDA reiterated, among other points, that the adequacy of the data to support approval will depend upon the observed ORR and the DOR assessed in the context of available therapy in a risk-benefit analysis during NDA review. Study design modifications and FDA feedback include the following:
•Phase 2 cohort sample sizes to support potential approval may include Phase 1 patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose. 
 •In the EXP-2 cohort (ROS1 TKI-pretreated with one prior TKI and one platinum-based regimen), the sample size is decreased from previous target of 100 patients to 60 total patients. A minimum duration of follow up of 6 months from the last response may be sufficient to support approval.
 •In the EXP-4 cohort (ROS1 TKI-pretreated with one prior TKI and no prior chemotherapy), the sample size is increased to a target of 60 patients. Previously, EXP-4 was an exploratory cohort in this patient population. A minimum duration of follow up of 6 months from the last response may be sufficient to support approval.
 •In the EXP-5 and EXP-6 cohorts (TRK TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated), a minimum of 9 months and 6 months of follow up, respectively, from the last response may be sufficient to support approval. 
  In April 2021, we held a Type B meeting with the FDA during which we received feedback on next steps toward a potential NDA submission for repotrectinib for patients treated within the EXP-1 cohort. The FDA guidance was generally supportive of our current plans for clinical, manufacturing and companion diagnostic development. In addition, the FDA guided that a meeting should be requested to discuss topline BICR results when responders have been followed for greater than or equal to six months past onset of response. We anticipate reporting topline BICR data from all of the ROS1+ NSCLC cohorts from TRIDENT-1 and discussing the BICR data with the FDA at a pre-NDA meeting, in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to discuss available BICR data in at least 50 TKI-naïve and 50 TKI-pretreated patients with at least six months of follow-up for the majority of responders.

In December 2021, we held a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss potential next steps for repotrectinib in NTRK+ TKI-pretreated advanced solid tumor patients treated within expansion cohort 6 (EXP-6) of the TRIDENT-1 study. The FDA guided that a pre-NDA meeting should be requested to discuss the topline BICR results from the Phase 2 TKI-pretreated EXP-6 and TKI-naïve EXP-5 patients, when responders have been followed for at least six months past onset of response. The FDA also acknowledged our plan to submit to the pre-NDA meeting, BICR data from 40 patients from EXP-6 and BICR data from patients enrolled in EXP-5 cohort at that time (estimated at approximately 40 patients of the targeted 55 patients). The FDA noted that data from EXP-5 may be used to support the efficacy data for EXP-6, or potentially could be pooled with data from EXP-6 to support a broader indication. The FDA stated that whether the data from EXP-6 and EXP-5 are deemed potentially adequate to either support a broader indication or an indication in patients who have received a prior TKI across a wide range of tumor types will be determined at the time of the submission of the pre-NDA meeting package, and ultimately during the review of the NDA submission. We plan to provide guidance on the timing of the pre-NDA meeting for repotrectinib in patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors after completion of enrollment of the targeted 40 EXP-6 patients is achieved.
 Companion Diagnostic
 We have developed a prototype companion diagnostic that is being used as a clinical trial assay to confirm the presence of ROS1+ or NTRK+ gene fusions in patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1. We received investigational device exemption from the FDA for our clinical trial assay, in May 2019, which allows its use as an investigational device in the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 and supports a potential future pre-market approval (PMA) application to the FDA. We are also enrolling patients into the Phase 2 portion of TRIDENT-1 based on the results of select laboratory developed tests and other tests used by the clinical sites.
Pediatric Strategy
 Beyond TRIDENT-1, we are conducting an open-label Phase 1/2 single arm, multi-center, dose-escalation, safety and pharmacokinetics clinical trial of repotrectinib in pediatric and young adult patients with ALK+, ROS1+, or NTRK+ advanced solid tumors. The Phase 1 portion of this trial is a dose finding study in patients aged <12 years old. The Phase 2 portion is designed to enroll patients into 3 separate cohorts based on the identified oncogenic driver and prior treatment, (1) NTRK+ TKI-naïve, (2) NTRK+ TKI-pretreated and (3) Other NTRK, ALK, ROS1 genetic alterations not otherwise specified.
 During the third quarter of 2021, we reported progress in the Phase 1/2 CARE study of repotrectinib in pediatric and young adult patients at the SIOP Congress. Utilizing an August 2, 2021 data cutoff, ten patients were treated across two dose levels. Eight patients were evaluable for efficacy, including four TKI-naïve and four TKI-pretreated patients. Patients included in the efficacy analysis had baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline evaluable scan. Response evaluation was by physician assessment and per RECIST 1.1 or RANO for CNS tumors. Responses were confirmed with a subsequent scan at least 28 days later. Three TKI-naïve patients (two with NTRK fusion solid tumors and one with ROS1 fusion IMT) achieved confirmed responses, including one complete response. Of the four TKI-pretreated patients, one patient with NTRK fusion sarcoma had a best response of stable disease. Repotrectinib was generally well tolerated.
 Combination Strategy
We believe our preliminary safety data and antitumor activity from TRIDENT-1 support pursuing combination therapies for repotrectinib. Preclinical studies have shown that repotrectinib inhibits JAK2, SRC, and FAK, which leads to modulation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, one of the major signaling pathways for both intrinsic and acquired treatment resistance. The combination of repotrectinib with a KRAS G12C inhibitor showed preclinical synergy inhibiting KRAS G12C tumor cell proliferation, suppressing receptor tyrosine kinase upregulation and reducing KRAS G12C tumor cell cytokine release. The combination of repotrectinib with a KRAS G12C inhibitor in vivo showed significantly increased survival in a lung model (H2122, G12C) relative to each agent given alone. The combination of repotrectinib with a MEK inhibitor showed preclinical synergy in mutant KRAS NSCLC, colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer cell lines as well as demonstrating enhanced activity in vivo. These results suggest that the combination of repotrectinib with a MEK inhibitor can repress the mutant KRAS signaling network to achieve more potent and durable anti-tumor activity.
Based on preclinical data we presented at the AACR annual meeting in April 2021 demonstrating that repotrectinib in combination with an approved MEK inhibitor, trametinib, had greater activity than single-agent treatment of either repotrectinib or trametinib in patient-derived KRAS mutant G12D/V lung and G12D/V/R pancreatic cancer models, we initiated our Phase 1b/2 TRIDENT-2 study of repotrectinib and trametinib in patients with KRAS mutant G12D advanced
solid tumors in the third quarter of 2021. The clinical study is designed to examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and any early signals of efficacy of the combination.
  Elzovantinib (TPX-0022)—A Novel MET/SRC/CSF1R Inhibitor
Background
 We are developing elzovantinib (TPX-0022), our MET/SRC/CSF1R orally administered TKI, for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in MET. Our ongoing Phase 1 SHIELD-1 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the overall safety profile, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of elzovantinib. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for elzovantinib, other than the rights licensed to Zai in the Zai Territory.
 MET-alterations are well documented in multiple solid tumors, notably NSCLC and gastrointestinal cancers such as gastric and colorectal. Three to 4% of NSCLC are estimated to be driven by MET exon 14 skipping mutations, and up to 6% are estimated to be driven by MET amplification. It is also estimated that approximately 15-20% of patients with EGFR driven NSCLC will develop resistance due to MET amplification following treatment with an EGFR TKI. In addition, 3-5% of gastric cancers are estimated to be driven by MET amplification. There are currently two FDA approved MET TKIs, Tabrecta (capmatinib) and Tepmetko (tepotinib), for NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations. There continues to be a high unmet medical need to develop novel therapies for MET driven disease that can prolong DOR for MET exon 14 skipping NSCLC with a more tolerable overall safety profile, and for MET amplification in NSCLC and other tumor types where there are no approved therapies.
 Elzovantinib is a multi-targeted orally bioavailable Type I TKI with a novel macrocyclic structure that potently inhibits MET, SRC and CSF1R, in preclinical assays. MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the high-affinity natural ligand of MET. MET alterations, including point mutations, amplifications, fusions, exon 14 skipping, and the generation of HGF-MET autocrine loops have been reported in many cancers.
 SRC and STAT3 can act cooperatively as upstream regulators of HGF expression, resulting in establishment of an HGF autocrine/paracrine loop, signal amplification, and an invasive phenotype. SRC inhibition may have the potential to reduce or abolish the upregulation of HGF via the modulation of STAT3 signaling. Targeting CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor) leads to the modulation of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), which is a promising therapeutic strategy for elzovantinib as a single agent or in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and immunotherapy in various solid tumors. Macrophages are cells in the immune system that generally detect and destroy diseased cells. TAMs, however, are macrophages that have a tumor-promoting function based on their capacity to secrete growth factors and suppress the immune system. Survival of TAMs is mediated by signaling through CSF1R. In addition, autocrine and paracrine upregulation of HGF can limit the likelihood of response and DOR achieved with the current investigational MET inhibitors in the clinic.
 Preclinical data demonstrates that elzovantinib can reprogram tumor associated macrophages as well as support antigen presentation and activation of T cells within the tumor microenvironment. This unique profile engaging autocrine signaling pathways is expected to more effectively suppress CSF1R/MET mediated signaling in tumor cells and the stroma which can contribute to tumor invasiveness and metastasis. During the first quarter of 2021, we presented preclinical data at AACR demonstrating potential utility of elzovantinib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In a syngeneic xenograft tumor model, elzovantinib downregulated immunosuppressive cytokines, increased anti-tumor M1 macrophages, and enriched levels of CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells. Elzovantinib had single agent in vivo efficacy and enhanced the efficacy of an anti-PD-1 inhibitor.
SHIELD-1 Phase 1 Trial
 Elzovantinib is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1 study called SHIELD-1 for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in MET, which was initiated in July 2019. MET genetic alterations –exon 14 skipping, amplification, fusion or oncogenic kinase domain mutations -- are assessed by local testing. The dose finding portion of the study employs a 3+3 design. Dose expansion in multiple cohorts may occur at preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose(s). Responses are evaluated by RECIST 1.1. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate safety and tolerability of elzovantinib and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and RP2D.

In October 2021, we presented preliminary data from the Phase 1 dose finding portion of SHIELD-1 utilizing an August 23, 2021 data cutoff date. 54 patients were treated across seven dose levels. Patients included those with NSCLC (n=31), gastric or GEJ cancer (n=9), CRC (n=5), and other solid tumors (n=9) harboring genetic alterations in MET. Of the 54 patients, 93% received prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and 72% had a baseline ECOG performance score of 1. Preliminary efficacy data were available for 46 evaluable patients with baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline evaluable scan. Responses were confirmed with a subsequent scan at least 28 days later per RECIST 1.1 and were determined by physician assessment.
 Preliminary Safety Analysis (n=54)
•Elzovantinib was generally well tolerated.
 •The most frequently reported TEAE was dizziness (65%) of which 94% of reported cases were Grade 1 or Grade 2.
 •Dose modifications due to TEAEs included 39% of patients who had dose reduction and 6% who had drug discontinuation.
 •Two dose-limiting toxicities of Grade 3 vertigo and Grade 2 dizziness occurred at 120 mg QD.
 •Peripheral edema was reported in 20% of patients and none were Grade 3 or higher. No ILD/pneumonitis of any grade was reported. Additionally, no treatment related Grade 3 or higher ALT/AST elevation was reported.
Preliminary Efficacy Analysis (n=46)
 •A total of 46 patients were evaluable for efficacy, including 32 who were MET TKI-naïve; 11 with NSCLC, nine with GC/GEJ cancer, and 12 with other solid tumors. Of the 11 NSCLC patients, five had MET exon 14 skipping, four had MET amplification, and two had MET oncogenic mutations. Of the nine GC/GEJ cancer patients, eight had MET amplification and one had MET fusion. Of the 12 patients with advanced other solid tumors, seven had MET amplification, three had MET exon 14 skipping, and two had MET fusions.
 •Among the 11 MET TKI-naïve NSCLC patients, four achieved confirmed responses for a confirmed ORR of 36% (95% CI: 11-69) across all dose levels. Of the four confirmed responders, one had MET exon 14 skipping, one had MET amplification with a gene copy number (GCN) of 7, and two had MET oncogenic mutations. The DOR range (n=4) was 1.8+ to 15+ months, with the longest duration in a MET exon 14 skipping NSCLC patient previously treated with immunotherapy, who remained in a response for 15+ months and on treatment for 18+ months.
 •Among the nine MET TKI-naïve GC/GEJ patients, three achieved confirmed responses for a confirmed ORR of 33% (95% CI: 7-70) across all dose levels. Of the three responders, all had MET amplification with GCNs of 12, 14 and 25. The DOR range (n=3) was 5.2 to 12.9+ months.
 •Among the 12 patients with advanced other solid tumors, one patient with MET amplified CRC with a GCN of 34 achieved a confirmed response.
 •14 patients were MET TKI-pretreated; 13 with NSCLC and one with liver cancer. This population was heavily pretreated with 36% having received at least five lines of prior therapy. The median number of prior therapies was three (range 1 to 6). Seven of 13 NSCLC patients achieved stable disease as their best response for a clinical benefit rate of 54%.
 Regulatory Status
 During the third quarter of 2021 we participated in an End of Phase 1 Meeting with the FDA Division of Oncology 2 (DO2, the division responsible for oversight of the lung cancer therapeutic area) focused on next steps for elzovantinib in NSCLC, where the design of the planned Phase 2 portion of the SHIELD-1 study and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) were discussed. The FDA indicated that our Phase 2 design may be acceptable to support a future NDA submission and guided that the adequacy of the data to support accelerated approval would consider the magnitude and DORs in a risk-benefit analysis, and will depend on available therapies and the treatment landscape for NSCLC at the time of a potential future NDA submission. We proposed a RP2D of 40 mg QD to 40 mg BID at the meeting based on available data. The FDA recommended that we explore an additional intermediate dose level using the QD titration to BID dosing strategy in at least six to 10 patients prior to starting the Phase 2 portion of the study. We are currently evaluating the 60 mg QD to 60 mg BID intermediate dose level in the dose escalation portion of SHIELD-1 and continuing to enroll patients in the Phase 1 dose
expansion portion of the study at 40 mg QD to 40 mg BID. Based on the FDA feedback, we plan to revise SHIELD-1 into a potentially registrational Phase 1/2 study and initiate the Phase 2 portion of SHIELD-1 in the second half of 2022 pending FDA feedback on data from the intermediate dose level.
 During the fourth quarter of 2021, we also participated in a Type B meeting with the FDA Division of Oncology 3 (DO3, the division responsible for oversight of gastric cancer therapeutic area). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the proposed approach to identifying the RP2D and the planned Phase 2 portion of the SHIELD-1 study focused on the potential next steps for elzovantinib in patients with MET amplified gastric/GEJ cancer. The FDA DO3 agreed with the approach for RP2D identification previously discussed with FDA DO2. The FDA also agreed with our plan to proceed to the potentially registrational Phase 2 MET amplified gastric/GEJ cancer expansion cohorts of SHIELD-1 after RP2D determination. Based on guidance from the FDA, we plan to submit data to the FDA DO3 from gastric cancer patients in the Phase 2 to discuss the potential registrational aspect of the study.
 In October 2021, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with EQRx to evaluate elzovantinib in combination with aumolertinib (EQ143), EQRx’s drug candidate targeting EGFR, in patients with EGFR mutant MET-amplified advanced NSCLC. Preclinical data suggest the combination of MET and EGFR inhibition has the potential to increase anti-tumor activity based on complementary mechanisms. It is estimated that 15% to 20% of patients who progress on a first-line EGFR inhibitor develop MET amplification as the basis of acquired resistance.
 Under the terms of the agreement, we will sponsor and conduct a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination regimen and will assume all costs associated with the trial. EQRx will provide aumolertinib at no cost. We anticipate initiating the SHIELD-2 combination study of elzovantinib and aumolertinib in mid-2022.
   TPX-0046—A Novel RET Inhibitor
TPX-0046 is a multi-targeted orally bioavailable, Type I TKI with a novel macrocyclic structure that is being developed as a RET kinase inhibitor. The Phase 1 portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TPX-0046 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring RET genetic alterations is ongoing. The trial is designed to enroll TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for TPX-0046.
 RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Constitutive activation of RET through gain-of-function mutations, amplifications and fusions have been found in multiple tumor types, including lung cancer, thyroid cancer and colon cancer. To date, two approved RET inhibitors, GAVRETO (pralsetinib) and RETEVMO (selpercatinib), are marketed for patients with RET-positive NSCLC and thyroid cancer. In addition, multi-targeted TKIs that inhibit RET have been approved by the FDA in thyroid cancer.
TPX-0046 Clinical Development Plan
 The Phase 1 dose finding portion of the Phase 1/2 SWORD-1 clinical trial of TPX-0046 is ongoing. The trial is designed to enroll TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients with RET-altered non-small-cell lung, thyroid, and other advanced cancers in multiple cohorts to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary clinical activity of TPX-0046, in a Phase 1 dose finding portion, followed by multiple Phase 1 dose expansion cohorts after determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose. We are continuing to evaluate multiple doses and schedules to further characterize the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy profile of TPX-0046 before determining the recommended Phase 2 dose.
 In April 2021, we reported initial data from the Phase 1 dose finding portion of our SWORD-1 clinical trial of TPX-0046. Twenty-one patients enrolled in the study, including 10 with NSCLC and 11 with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) who were treated between December 2019 and the data cut-off date of March 10, 2021. Patients included those with RET-altered TKI-naïve NSCLC (n=3; all previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy) and MTC (n=2), and TKI-pretreated NSCLC (n=7) and MTC (n=9). All 16 TKI-pretreated patients were previously treated with a selective RET TKI and nine patients (56%) were treated with more than one prior TKI. Ninety-one percent of patients (19/21) had a baseline ECOG performance score of one, and nearly half (10/21) received three or more prior therapies.
Preliminary efficacy data by investigator assessment was available for 14 evaluable patients with baseline measurable disease and at least one post-baseline assessment per RECIST 1.1, including TKI-naïve NSCLC (n=3) and MTC (n=2), and TKI-pretreated NSCLC (n=4) and MTC (n=5). As of the March 10, 2021 data cut-off date:
Preliminary Safety and Pharmacokinetic Results
 •A total of 21 patients with RET-altered NSCLC or MTC were treated with TPX-0046 across multiple doses and schedules from 10mg QD to 30mg QD. TPX-0046 was generally well tolerated, with the most frequent TEAE being Grade 1 or 2 dizziness. The maximum tolerated dose had not been determined, with 1 dose-limiting toxicity of treatment-related Grade 2 gait disturbance at 30 mg QD.
 •TEAEs reported in greater than 20 percent of patients were dizziness (43%); fatigue (38%); alkaline phosphatase increase, constipation, decreased appetite, dry mouth, hyperphosphataemia, lipase increase (29% each); and alanine aminotransferase increase, dehydration, and muscular weakness (24% each).
 •There were infrequent dose reductions or drug discontinuations due to TEAEs. The majority of TRAEs were Grade 1 or 2 and there were no Grade 4 or 5 TRAEs. There were no treatment related Grade 3 or greater ALT/AST elevations, any grade of hypertension, hemorrhagic events or QT prolongation, and no interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.
 •Preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicates exposure increases in a dose dependent manner.
 Preliminary Efficacy Results
 •Of five RET TKI-naïve patients, four showed tumor regressions of -42%, -37%, -23%, and -3%, including two patients dosed at 30 mg QD who achieved confirmed partial responses with DORs of 5.6 and 5.8+ months, respectively. Three of the four patients with regressions remained on treatment awaiting their next scan.
 •Of nine TKI-pretreated patients, three patients (two treated with only one prior selective RET TKI) achieved tumor regressions of -44%, -27% and -17%. All three patients remained on treatment awaiting their next scan.
 •Of the 14 evaluable patients, duration of treatment ranged from 5.1 to 51+ weeks and seven patients (50%) remained on treatment.
 We are currently continuing to evaluate doses and schedules to further characterize the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy profile of TPX-0046 before determining the RP2D.
 TPX-0131 – A Next-Generation ALK Inhibitor
We are developing TPX-0131, our orally administered ALK inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors harboring ALK gene fusions. TPX-0131 has demonstrated preclinical potency against wild type ALK fusion proteins as well as a broad spectrum of acquired resistance mutations, especially compound mutations which currently lack any effective ALK inhibitor therapy. Preclinical in vivo studies have shown that TPX-0131 has significant brain tissue penetration after repeat oral dosing achieving brain tissue concentrations over 60% of the plasma concentration supporting the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier. We initiated our Phase 1/2 FORGE-1 study of TPX-0131 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TKI-pretreated ALK-positive NSCLC in the second quarter of 2021.
 The trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TPX-0131, determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and assess preliminary clinical activity in TKI-pretreated patients. After determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose in the dose finding portion of the study, TPX-0131 would be evaluated in multiple dose expansion cohorts for a targeted enrollment of approximately 180 patients. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights for TPX-0131. We anticipate providing early interim data from initial patients treated in the dose-finding portion of the FORGE-1 study in the fourth quarter of 2022 or early 2023.
 Clinically significant ALK gene fusions are oncogenic drivers and have been found in a number of human cancers, especially in NSCLC. Approximately 3-5% of NSCLC tumors harbor oncogenic ALK fusions. Currently, there are five FDA approved ALK inhibitors available for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. Sequential therapy with a next-generation selective ALK inhibitor with increased potency and effectiveness against ALK resistance mutations is a key strategy for treating ALK+ NSCLC patients. The most common solvent front mutation ALK G1202R confers resistance to the current approved ALK inhibitors with one study showing the prevalence of this specific solvent front mutation in approximately 40% of patients treated with a prior ALK inhibitor who developed a resistant mutation. Lorlatinib is the only approved ALK inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical efficacy in ALK+ NSCLC patients who developed the ALK G1202R mutation from a prior ALK TKI.
More recently, compound mutations have been reported in patients after treatment with two or three ALK TKIs. One such example is the compound mutation ALK G1202R/L1196M, which confers resistance to currently approved therapies, including lorlatinib.
 TPX-0131 is a next-generation ALK inhibitor drug candidate designed with a compact macrocyclic structure, and in preclinical studies has been shown to potently inhibit wildtype ALK and numerous ALK mutations, in particular the clinically observed G1202R solvent front mutation and G1202R/L1196M compound mutation.
 TPX-0131 showed comparable or stronger potency against wildtype ALK and many mutated forms of ALK in Ba/F3 cell proliferation assays against other ALK inhibitors as summarized below. TPX-0131 was 11 – 550-fold more potent toward the gatekeeper mutation (L1196M) in cell proliferation assays than previous generations of ALK inhibitors. In preclinical in vivo rat brain distribution studies, TPX-0131 demonstrated significant brain penetration after oral dosing. We believe access to the CNS compartment will be important in treating brain metastases.

    Discovery Platform
 Our macrocycle platform is the foundation of our current development pipeline where we applied novel small molecule design approaches integrating tumor biology and structure-based drug design to develop a new generation of orally available proprietary TKIs that we believe will have the ability to maintain or enhance inhibition of the targeted kinase in both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients. Our approach to the discovery of new and potentially differentiated drug candidates is to use a methodology anchored by our structure-based drug design expertise, coupled with a disciplined chemistry approach and enabling biology. We anticipate our internal and external exploration of oncology candidates will continue to include kinase targets and other oncogenic signaling proteins and pathways that address high unmet medical need. We currently have four internal discovery programs targeting aberrant GTPase signaling known to drive genomically defined cancers with significant unmet medical need. The most advanced programs target KRAS G12D and the p21 activated kinase, or “PAK” family. We are targeting the identification of two development candidates in the second half of 2022 with a goal to achieve at least one new IND per year beginning in 2023. We anticipate providing details on our other two GTPase signaling discovery programs in the second half of 2022.

After termination (but not natural expiration), other than certain terminations by Zai for cause, we are entitled to retain a worldwide and perpetual license from Zai to exploit the elzovantinib Products.
 EQRx – Clinical Collaboration
In October 2021, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with EQRx (the EQRx Agreement) to evaluate elzovantinib in combination with aumolertinib (EQ143), EQRx’s drug candidate targeting EGFR, in patients with EGFR mutant MET-amplified advanced NSCLC. Under the EQRx Agreement, we will sponsor, conduct and fund a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination, and EQRx is obligated to supply aumolertinib at no cost.
 Pursuant to the terms of the EQRx Agreement, EQRx has granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, royalty-free license, with a right to sublicense (subject to limitations), to use certain EQRx intellectual property, and aumolertinib, solely as necessary or useful for us to conduct the combination clinical trial under the EQRx Agreement. We are obligated to provide EQRx with quarterly reports regarding data generated from the combination clinical trial.
 The EQRx Agreement will terminate upon completion of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, the delivery of the data resulting from the trial and the completion of any statistical analyses of the data resulting from the trial. Either party may terminate the EQRx Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that remains uncured following 60 days after the date of written notice of such breach or upon certain bankruptcy events. In addition, (a) either party may terminate the EQRx Agreement immediately upon written notice if such party reasonably deems it necessary in order to protect the safety, health or welfare of subjects enrolled in the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, (b) either party may terminate the EQRx Agreement if a clinical hold arises with respect to elzovantinib or aumolertinib that adversely impacts the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial or the costs or time to complete the trial, and (c) we may terminate the EQRx Agreement for convenience at any time upon 60 days prior written notice.
 Commercial Operations
 For repotrectinib, we intend to establish our own commercial and marketing organization in the United States and to selectively establish partnerships in markets outside the United States. We intend to build a specialist sales force to target physicians who are high prescribers of treatments for solid tumors. We expect that the sales force will be supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. Additionally, we expect that the sales and marketing teams will manage relationships with key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, physician group networks, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we expect to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to approval of repotrectinib, which we may never obtain.
For our other drug candidates, we intend to retain commercialization rights in the United States and leverage our commercial and marketing organization for repotrectinib, assuming we obtain regulatory approval in the United States. For
certain drug candidates, we will consider entering into relationships with strategic partners that enable the expansion of the ongoing clinical development, while retaining significant value for our stockholders. These pharmaceutical company partnerships could focus on specific patient populations and their caregivers, on regional development, or on distribution and sales. We currently have worldwide development and commercialization rights to our drug candidates, other than the rights licensed to Zai for repotrectinib and elzovantinb in the Zai Territory.
Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained materials for repotrectinib and our other drug candidates for our ongoing and planned clinical testing from third-party manufacturers. Although we may enter into long-term supply arrangements for the commercial supply of repotrectinib in the future, we currently obtain our supplies of repotrectinib from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and may continue to do so in the near future. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for commercial active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or for clinical and commercial drug product. We believe our current supply and plans for supply will be sufficient to meet our anticipated clinical development needs for our drug candidates through 2022. However, depending on available manufacturing capacity at our supplier, our supply could be adversely impacted, which may result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain. For all of our drug candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the APIs and drug product prior to submission of a NDA to the FDA or other marketing authorization applications to other regulatory authorities.
 All our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured from readily available starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes that are generally amenable to scale-up and do not require specialized equipment in the manufacturing process, however, any issues in manufacturing, including scale-up, could result in significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
 Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with a more favorable label than repotrectinib or any other drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Repotrectinib Competition
 If we are successful in developing repotrectinib, we expect that repotrectinib will compete against approved drugs, including: crizotinib, which is marketed by Pfizer Inc. under the name Xalkori for the treatment of ROS1+ and ALK+ NSCLC, entrectinib, which is marketed by F. Hoffman La Roche AG under the name Rozlytrek, for the treatment of ROS1+ NSCLC and TRK+ solid tumors; and larotrectinib, which is marketed by Bayer AG under the trade name Vitrakvi, for the treatment of TRK+ solid tumors. We also expect that repotrectinib will compete against other compounds which are currently in late-stage clinical development, including TKIs in Phase 2 or later clinical development for the treatment of ROS1+ NSCLC at companies including Pfizer Inc. (lorlatinib), Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (ceritinib), Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (ensartinib), Exelixis, Inc. (cabozantinib), and AnHeart Therapeutics Company (taletrectinib) and TKIs in Phase 2 or later clinical development for the treatment of TRK+ solid tumors at companies including Bayer AG (selitrectinib) Exelixis, Inc. (cabozantinib) and AnHeart Therapeutics Company (taletrectinib).
Elzovantinib Competition
 If we are successful in developing elzovantinib, we expect that elzovantinib will compete against capmatinib, which is marketed by Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation under the name Tabrecta; tepotinib, which is marketed by Merck KGaA under the name Tepmetko; savolitinib, which is marketed in China by AstraZeneca PLC and Hutchison China MediTech Limited under the name Orpathys; and amivantamab, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson under the name Rybrevant. Capmatinib, tepotinib and savolitinib are indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 skipping alterations. We also expect that elzovantinib will compete against Xalkori (crizotinib) and other compounds which are in Phase 2 or later clinical development for the treatment of MET+ tumors at companies including Exelixis, Inc. (cabozantinib), Apollomics, Inc. (APL-101), Haihe Biopharma Co., Ltd (glumetinib), Servier (Sym015), AbbVie Inc. (telisotuzumab vedotin) and Aveo Oncology (ficlatuzumab).
TPX-0046 Competition
 If we are successful in developing TPX-0046, we expect that TPX-0046 will compete against selpercatinib, which is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the names Retevmo and Retsevmo for the treatment of NSCLC, medullary thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid cancer in patients with RET gene alterations; and pralsetinib, which is marketed by F. Hoffman La Roche AG and Blueprint Medicines Corporation under the name Gavreto for the treatment of NSCLC, medullary thyroid cancer and other types of thyroid cancer in patients with RET gene alterations. Both selpercatinib and pralsetinib are in development for the treatment of other RET+ cancers. We also expect TPX-0046 will compete against other approved multi-kinase inhibitors with RET activity that are being evaluated in clinical trials including cabozantinib (Exelixis, Inc.), lenvatinib (Eisai Inc.), sorafenib (Bayer AG), sunitinib (Pfizer Inc.) and vandetinib (Sanofi Genzyme). We also expect TPX-0046 will compete against compounds which are in Phase 2 or later clinical development for the treatment of RET+ tumors at companies including Helsinn Group (HM06).
TPX-0131 Competition
 If we are successful in developing TPX-0131, we expect that TPX-0131 will compete against approved drugs, including: alectinib, which is marketed by F. Hoffman La Roche AG under the name Alecensa for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC; brigatinib, which is marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited under the name Alunbrig for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC; ceritinib, which is marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation under the name Zykadia for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC; crizotinib, which is marketed by Pfizer Inc. under the name Xalkori for the treatment of ROS1+ and ALK+ NSCLC; and lorlatinib, which is marketed by Pfizer Inc. under the names Lorbrena and Lorviqua for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. We also expect that TPX-0131 will compete against other compounds which are currently in late-stage clinical development, including TKIs in Phase 2 or later clinical development for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC at companies including against Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (ensartinib).
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing, obtaining and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our drug candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our drug candidates and other commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties.
 The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our drug candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. Moreover, any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 As of January 31, 2022, we own two patents in the United States directed to repotrectinib and five patents in the United States directed to structurally related compounds, one of which is also directed generally towards elzovantinib. In addition, with respect to repotrectinib and elzovantinib, as of January 31, 2022, we also own foreign patents in a number of jurisdictions including Australia, China, Chile, Columbia, Eurasia, Hong Kong, Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Russia, Ukraine, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan and other global regions, directed to compound and pharmaceutical composition of matter claims and/or their use in the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer. These patents are expected to expire between January 2035 and July 2037 depending on the patent and country, without taking into account any possible patent term extension, where applicable. We also have pending patent applications directed to repotrectinib and its use in North America, Europe, Asia and other global regions which, if issued, are expected to expire at dates ranging between January 2035 and November 2040, without taking potential patent term extensions into account.
 We own one patent in the United States and one in Singapore directed specifically to elzovantinib and structurally related compounds. We also have pending patent applications directed specifically to elzovantinib and its use in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and other global regions which, if issued, are expected to expire at dates ranging between July 2038 and March 2041, without taking potential patent term extensions into account.
In addition to the repotrectinib and elzovantinib programs, as of January 31, 2022, we own one patent in the United States and one in Morocco directed to TPX-0046 and structurally related compounds. We also have pending patent applications directed to repotrectinib and its use in North America, Europe, Asia and other global regions which, if issued, are expected to expire December 2038, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. We also own one United States patent and have pending patent applications directed to composition of matter for TPX-0131 and structurally related compounds and their use in treating diseases, including cancer. Patents issuing from these applications are expected to expire in December 2040, without taking potential patent term extensions into account.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved
drug. It is possible that U.S. patents covering repotrectinib, elzovantinib and TPX-0046, and patents for TPX-0131, may or will be entitled to patent term extensions. If our drug candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved drug candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspects of our manufacturing processes. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our confidential information, as well as entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, contract manufacturers, CROs, hospitals, independent treatment centers, suppliers, collaborators and other third parties, such parties may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of drug products such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
United States Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our drug candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), regulation;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product candidate for its intended purpose;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;

•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP); and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 clinical trials for oncology indications generally involve a small number of disease-affected patients who are treated with the drug candidate in escalating dose cohorts. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to determine the MTD, or a recommended dose if the MTD is not achieved, assess the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug. Phase 1 clinical trials for oncology indications may also evaluate preliminary evidence of clinical activity. Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients (from several hundred to several thousand subjects) at multiple sites, in multiple countries and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a drug during marketing. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 A registrational trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, registrational trials are Phase 3 clinical trials but may be Phase 2 clinical trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the NDA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional
information about the characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
NDA Submission and Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. A determination by the FDA within 60 days of the receipt of an NDA to file the application for review for its completeness is initiated at the time of submission. If the FDA determines there is significance to the missing or incomplete information in the context of the proposed drug product, the proposed indication(s), and the amount of time needed to address any given deficiency, it can issue a refusal-to-file letter. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Once an NDA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee.

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics and drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the
therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational trial, if the trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the trial plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
 Pursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a PMA for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension), as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned patents, and if eligible for such restoration, to add patent term beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the
preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
European Drug Development
In Europe, our future drugs will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC sought to harmonize the European Union clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the European Union Member States transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the Directive, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the European Union countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA) and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the Directive all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) and entered into application on January 31, 2022. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Pursuant to the Regulation, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EMA’s Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), which will cover all regulatory and ethics assessments from the member states concerned. Any submissions made from January 31, 2023 onwards must be made through CTIS and all trials authorized pursuant to the Directive that are still ongoing on January 31, 2025 must be made through CTIS. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a member state’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Approval and monitoring of clinical trials in the European Union is, as it was under the Directive, the responsibility of individual member states, but compared to the position prior to the applicability of the Clinical Trials Regulation there is likely to be more collaboration, information-sharing, and decision-making between member states.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as medicines derived from biotechnology, such as genetic engineering, orphan medicinal drugs, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (SPC) and a
draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States (CMS)) for their approval. If the CMS raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e. in the RMS and the CMS).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Data and Marketing Exclusivity
In Europe, new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as certain countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA). Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information, or PHI, than HIPAA and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts.
 Many state laws govern the privacy of personal information in specified circumstances. For example, in California the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current version of the CCPA, other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.
 European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EEA and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information
provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs.
 There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. We, or our collaborators, will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any companion diagnostic tests we develop separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect a biopharmaceutical company’s ability to profitably sell any approved drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the
ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for the ACA marketplace, and instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how such challenges and additional health reform measures will impact the ACA and our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent amendments providers are subject to Medicare payment reductions of 2% per fiscal year through 2031, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the fiscal year of this sequester. On January 2, 2013, the then-U.S. President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other Healthcare Laws
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our drug candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 Additionally, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties law, prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices.
 HIPAA also created additional federal civil and criminal penalties for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many states have similar health care fraud and abuse laws that may differ from each other and federal law in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, states have anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope than analogous federal laws and may apply regardless of payer.
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to track and report on an annual basis payments made by them to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such obligations will include payments and other transfers of value provided to certain other healthcare professionals, including such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security requirements that may impact the way in which we conduct research and operate our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, place certain requirements with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as individuals and entities that provide services on behalf of a covered entity that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, as well as their covered subcontractors. In addition, we may be directly subject to certain state laws concerning privacy and data security. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CPPA), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosure to consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provides such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provides consumers with additional causes of action. This may impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Existing state laws governing the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, and, in some states, health information, impose differing requirements, thus complicating our compliance efforts.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and additional reporting and oversight obligations. If the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
 Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 Our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, and biological materials. In the United States, we are subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Controlled Substances Act and other federal, state or local regulations.
 We may be subject to further such regulations in the future. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from
these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
 Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 250 employees, all of whom were full-time employees, and 74 of whom hold Ph.D., Pharm.D. or M.D. degrees. Of these employees, 180 were engaged in research and development activities and 70 were engaged in general and administrative activities. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. We consider our culture and our talent to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. We have 10 dedicated, full-time employees responsible for executing our human capital management (HCM) strategy and overseeing all aspects of our human resources processes in place to support our employees. None of our current workforce is covered under collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Our HCM philosophy and objectives are designed to support our belief that our employees are vital to the success of the company. The HCM strategic initiatives employed focus on furthering our culture, talent management (attracting, engaging, and retaining our workforce) and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
Our Culture: Turning Point Together
 We believe we are better together, and we are guided by our vision to become the leader in precision oncology. Our high-performance culture is driven by and founded in our core values:
 •Human Centric: Our work revolves around the patients we aim to serve, as well as the team members we innovate alongside. We relentlessly pursue new therapies, all with the intent to improve the lives of people with cancer.
 •Speed-where it matters: We make decisions thoughtfully and quickly without sacrificing quality or integrity. Our team works with a sense of urgency to achieve its goals. We are dynamic with a purpose.
 •Extreme Team: We build strong relationships based on transparency and open communication. Determined but humble, we combine hard work and fun to achieve the extraordinary.
 •Resilience: Adaptive and nimble, we boldly embrace and drive change in order to continually evolve. We are continuous learners, recognizing challenges as opportunities to creatively solve problems.
 Accountability and transparency are critical to maintaining a successful culture. We hold regular all employee update meetings and utilize frequent email communications from management to keep our employees well-informed. In addition, we include a measure against our core values as a component of our annual performance review process.
Talent Management
 To achieve our goals we need to attract, engage, and develop our talent. We have an employee referral program in place and an experienced talent acquisition team to support the company’s hiring efforts. Despite the competitive recruiting landscape and additional challenges the COVID-19 pandemic presented, in 2021 we hired 137 new full-time employees. We believe our total compensation package helps us attract and retain our employees. We include market competitive pay, broad based annual performance bonuses, companywide equity grants, as well as a variety of benefits, leave programs, time off and a 401(k) plan, with flexibility to meet the individual health and wellness needs of our employees.
 To keep the pulse of our employee engagement we solicit employee feedback through periodic surveys and meet with our culture club, a cross functional multi-level group, to help align our programs, activities, and benefits to what is most important to our teams. We launched a company wide recognition platform to foster culture of gratitude and acknowledge behaviors aligned with our values.
We support employee growth and development at all levels in the organization and continue to focus and enhance programs in this area. We provide promotional opportunities and encourage internal applications for open positions in the company. All employees have an individual development plan in place, and we provide an online learning platform to support individual training needs. We coach and train leaders to encourage ongoing feedback and utilization of tools such as
a new hire 90-day feedback form and a midyear check in process. We encourage employees to participate in external professional training programs, industry events and other resources to further development.
 We are committed to providing opportunities to give back to our communities and engage in corporate social responsibility initiatives. We provide all employees with eight hours of paid time off each year for volunteer activities to support a community organization of their choice. Turning Point also sponsors, and employees participate, in a variety of industry related and community events.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive working environment. When we say ‘diverse,’ we mean it in all senses of the word: not only in race, gender, ethnicity, age, and orientation, but also in our interests, drivers and passion points. We believe our individual differences and perspectives are what make us stronger as a team and unite us in our purpose.
 As of December 31, 2021, our employees were 61% self-reportedly women with 50% self-reported women in positions of director and above in the organization.
 Also, as of December 31, 2021, 51% of all employees were self-reportedly ethnic or racial minorities with 37% Asian, 4% Black or African American, 6% Hispanic or Latino and 3% of other minority groups or two or more races.
 We are proud of our metrics to date and are looking at ways to broaden our outreach and increasing opportunities to underrepresented minorities in our recruitment efforts and hiring practices.
 We strive to provide equitable pay to our workforce. We established compensation ranges based on benchmark data. Leveling within these ranges considering role, market data, geography, experience, and internal equity. We have a pay-for-performance compensation philosophy that ties compensation to the performance of the company and the individual. Our compensation package includes market-competitive salary, broad-based performance bonuses and equity grants. We seek fairness in total compensation utilizing external market data regularly to ensure pay levels are competitive, and internal equity reviews help to provide fair pay within the company. In 2021, we realized a competitive employment market which resulted in unusual increases in compensation trends. We performed a mid-year compensation review to ensure our pay practices were equitable and competitive.
 COVID-19 Employee Safety
 Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, Turning Point has prioritized employee safety and compliance with federal, state and local orders related to COVID-19. We formed a cross functional team to monitor and communicate ongoing protocols and procedures and limited onsite work to only lab employees during the mandated shut down periods. As more employees transition back onsite, we continue to maintain strict safety procedures including requiring vaccinations, weekly voluntary COVID-19 testing, facility cleaning throughout the day, and company provided face coverings. Human Resources and management maintain close communication with remote based and onsite employees and we encourage feedback from our employees as we navigate these unprecedented times together.
