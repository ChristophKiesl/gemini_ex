Our Product Candidates
 XEN1101, A Kv7 Potassium Channel Modulator for the Treatment of Epilepsy
 XEN1101 is a differentiated Kv7 potassium channel modulator being developed for the treatment of epilepsy and potentially other neurological disorders. We acquired XEN1101 from 1st Order Pharmaceuticals pursuant to an asset purchase agreement in April 2017. For a more detailed description of the terms of this agreement with 1st Order Pharmaceuticals, see “—Collaborations, Commercial and License Agreements” below. 
 The Kv7 potassium channel mechanism has been clinically validated with ezogabine, an earlier generation Kv7 modulator that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as an adjunctive treatment for adults with focal seizures with or without secondary generalization. XEN1101’s unique composition is chemically designed to improve upon potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of ezogabine, and is not expected to have ezogabine’s composition-specific tissue pigmentation effects.
 Clinical Development
 We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial that evaluated the safety, tolerability and PK of both single ascending doses, or SAD, and multiple ascending doses, or MAD, of XEN1101 in healthy subjects. The XEN1101 Phase 1 clinical trial also included a pharmacodynamic, or PD, read-out from transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, studies that were designed to assess XEN1101’s ability and potency to modulate cortical excitability, thereby demonstrating activity in the target CNS tissue. The XEN1101 Phase 1 results include data from six SAD cohorts ranging in dose from 5 to 30 mg (n=34, placebo=8), including a crossover food effect cohort (n=10) with a single 20 mg dose. MAD results included three cohorts ranging in once daily doses from 15 to 25 mg (n=18, placebo=6) including two cohorts of 15 mg evaluated in a fasted and fed state over 7 and 10 days, respectively, and one cohort of 25 mg evaluated in a fed state over 10 days. The PK profile of XEN1101 (including an effective half-life greater than 24 hours) supports a once-per-day dosing schedule with expected steady state in approximately one week without the need for titration. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, were mild or moderate, resolved spontaneously and were consistent with antiepileptic drugs of this class. Sedation (including somnolence and drowsiness) and dizziness (including light-headedness and presyncope) were the most common AEs, while mild cognitive effects (including memory and speech impairment) and blurred vision were also observed in a dose dependent manner. There were no serious adverse events, deaths, or clinically significant delayed ventricular repolarization or laboratory findings. Phase 1 results suggest that that XEN1101 is generally safe and well tolerated in the doses examined (single doses of up to 30 mg and multiple doses of up to 25 mg once daily). 
 We also completed a Phase 1b double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over TMS study that included 20 healthy male subjects. TMS measurements were taken at 2 and 4 hours for all subjects and, due to a prolonged absorption phase displayed by XEN1101, an additional TMS assessment time-point was added at 6 hours for a subset of subjects. Subjects were randomized initially to either a 20 mg dose of XEN1101 or placebo and then, after a one-week wash-out period, crossed over to the other treatment arm. XEN1101 reduced corticospinal excitability, as demonstrated by a concentration dependent elevation in resting motor threshold, or RMT, the key TMS-EMG measure. RMT increased in proportion to XEN1101 plasma concentration showing a mean ± standard error of mean increase of 4.9 ± 0.7% (p<0.01) at 6 hours. Active motor threshold, or AMT, also increased in proportion to plasma concentration of XEN1101 with an increase of 2.0 ± 0.4% at 6 hours. In addition, XEN1101 statistically significantly modulated TMS-evoked electroencephalogram, or EEG, potentials, or TEPs, in a pattern consistent with reductions in cortical excitability. Relative to time-matched placebo, at peak plasma levels, XEN1101 decreased the amplitude of TEPs vs placebo at 25, 45 and 180 ms after the TMS pulse. Additional measures of cortical excitability including global mean field power were similarly impacted. XEN1101 also shifted the power spectra of resting state EEGs toward lower frequencies. This Phase 1b TMS study provided evidence of the CNS effects of a 20 mg dose of XEN1101 as indicated by suppression of cortical and corticospinal excitability, which helped inform dose selection for our XEN1101 Phase 2b clinical trial.
 A Phase 2b clinical trial, called the X-TOLE study, is ongoing and designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of XEN1101 administered as adjunctive treatment in approximately 300 adult patients with focal epilepsy in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The primary endpoint is the median percent change in monthly focal seizure frequency from baseline compared to treatment period of active versus placebo. We are in close collaboration with each of the XEN1101 clinical sites in North America and Europe, taking specific direction from their respective clinical guidelines as they relate to new patient screening and randomization in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have expanded the X-TOLE clinical trial to include new sites in both existing and new jurisdictions to support increased patient screening. It is anticipated that patient randomization will be completed in the first half of 2021, with topline data anticipated in the third quarter of 2021, dependent upon ongoing patient enrollment rates. In addition, based on our diligence and supporting pre-clinical data, we expect to support the initiation of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in 2021 with academic collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to study XEN1101 in major depressive disorder and anhedonia.

About Focal Seizures
 A focal seizure is localized within the brain and can either stay localized or spread to the entire brain, which is typically categorized as a secondary generalized seizure. Focal seizures are the most common type of seizure experienced by people with epilepsy. The treatment of an individual patient with focal seizures is currently focused on reduction of seizure frequency, with seizure freedom as the ultimate goal. Focal seizures (simple, complex, and secondary generalized tonic-clonic) account for approximately 60% of seizures (GlobalData Report 2017) of which approximately 33% are considered resistant to current treatments (Epilepsy Foundation). It is estimated that the addressable population in the United States could include approximately 460,000 adults and 70,000 pediatric patients with focal epilepsy.
XEN496, A Kv7 Potassium Channel Modulator for the Treatment of KCNQ2-DEE
 XEN496, a Kv7 potassium channel modulator, is a proprietary pediatric formulation of the active ingredient ezogabine being developed for the treatment of KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, or KCNQ2-DEE. Ezogabine was previously approved by the FDA as an anti-seizure medication, or ASM, as an adjunctive treatment for adults with focal seizures with or without secondary generalization. Published case reports where physicians have used ezogabine in infants and young children with KCNQ2-DEE suggest that XEN496 may be efficacious in this often hard-to-treat pediatric patient population.
 We have received Fast Track designation and orphan drug designation, or ODD, for XEN496 for the treatment of seizures associated with KCNQ2-DEE from the FDA, as well as an orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission. The FDA previously indicated that it is acceptable to study XEN496 in infants and children up to four years old, and that a single, small pivotal trial may be considered adequate in order to demonstrate XEN496’s efficacy in KCNQ2-DEE, provided the study shows evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit in patients with the intended indication. 
 Clinical Development
 We have developed XEN496 as a pediatric-specific, granule formulation of ezogabine to be presented as sprinkle capsules. Standard in vitro testing has shown that XEN496 acts as an “immediate-release” drug product. To support the Phase 3 clinical trial of XEN496 in patients with KCNQ2-DEE, we completed a PK study testing our proprietary pediatric formulation in 24 healthy adult volunteers. The PK profile observed for XEN496 is comparable to historical PK data for immediate-release ezogabine tablets, with XEN496 showing similar absorption and elimination curves, which supports plans for Phase 3 development.
 We have now initiated a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trial, called the “EPIK” study, evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of XEN496 administered as adjunctive treatment in approximately 40 pediatric patients aged one month to less than 6 years with KCNQ2-DEE. After screening, patients will enter a baseline period to assess the frequency of seizures. Eligible subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either XEN496 or placebo for approximately 15 weeks (titration and a 12-week maintenance period). At the end of treatment, there will be a period of tapering off of study drug, followed by a 28-day safety monitoring period. Patients may be considered for an open-label extension if they meet all requirements. The primary endpoint is the percent change from baseline in monthly countable motor seizure frequency during the blinded treatment period, as recorded by caregivers in a daily seizure diary. Key secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients experiencing greater than or equal to 50 percent reduction in monthly seizure frequency from baseline, caregiver global impression of change (CaGI-C) scores, and caregiver global impression of severity (CaGI-S) scores.
 About KCNQ2-DEE
 KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, or KCNQ2-DEE, otherwise known as EIEE7, is a rare, severe neurodevelopmental disorder with a significant seizure burden and profound developmental impairment. KCNQ2-DEE is uniquely characterized by multiple, daily, refractory seizures presenting within the first week of life with a prominent tonic component and autonomic signs. Seizures are often accompanied by clonic jerking or complex motor behavior. The electroencephalogram, or EEG, at onset of the disease shows a burst suppression pattern later evolving into multifocal epileptiform activity. The infants usually develop a severe to profound intellectual disability with axial hypotonia that can be accompanied by limb spasticity. The seizure activity typically decreases with age with some patients becoming seizure free or experiencing more minor seizure burden by 3 to 5 years of age; however, a survey of patient caregivers conducted by us indicates that a significant proportion of patients have ongoing seizures beyond this age range. The intellectual disability and other co-morbidities are not reversed or improved with age and patients generally require life-long care. Patients are often non-verbal, and some children may also have autistic features. Seizure-related bradycardia and oxygen desaturation with cyanosis have been observed and are thought to contribute to the significant risk of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy, or SUDEP, in these children. A recent epidemiology study from Europe examining the incidence and phenotypes of childhood-onset genetic epilepsies reports the incidence of KCNQ2-DEE as approximately 1 per 17,000 live births (5.89/100,000) compared to 1 per 12,200 live births estimated for Dravet Syndrome.

XEN007, A CNS-acting Calcium Channel Modulator
 XEN007 (active ingredient flunarizine) is a CNS-acting Cav2.1 and T-type calcium channel modulator that is being studied in treatment-resistant childhood absence epilepsy, or CAE, and potentially other neurological disorders. We have entered into key exclusive licensing agreements in order to access regulatory files and drug product manufacturing, both of which may enable advanced clinical development of XEN007. A physician-led, Phase 2 proof-of-concept study is ongoing to examine the potential clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of XEN007 as an adjunctive treatment in pediatric patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant CAE. A presentation of promising interim data collected from a small number of patients was presented at the virtual annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society in December 2020. Given the impact of COVID-19 on recruitment, we continue to work with our collaborator to expand the study to include additional sites and expect that topline results from a larger data set will be available in the second half of 2021. We expect to make a decision in 2021 regarding the future development of XEN007 in CAE.
About Childhood Absence Epilepsy
 Absence seizures are characterized by an abrupt impairment of awareness with arrest in behavior, staring, eye lid fluttering, and automatisms associated with generalized 3 Hz spike wave discharges, or SWD, on electroencephalogram, or EEG. A child may have one or many (up to 100) absence seizures a day and have problems with attention and learning. Flunarizine has been shown to be well tolerated clinically, and in pre-clinical models of absence seizures, flunarizine significantly reduced the number and duration of SWDs on EEG as mono-therapy and, when combined with valproic acid or ethosuximide, significantly reduced the SWD EEGs more than any drug alone. 
New Pipeline Opportunities
 Given our expertise in drug discovery, our efforts are concentrated on the identification of ion channel targets where we believe novel modulators might represent significant therapeutic advances, with a particular focus on epilepsy and other CNS-related indications. Expansion of our pipeline may come from our internal research efforts and through the acquisition or in-licensing of other external product candidates.
Our Partnered Programs
 NBI-921352, A Clinical Stage, Selective Nav1.6 Sodium Channel Inhibitor for the Treatment of Epilepsy
 In December 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Neurocrine Biosciences to develop treatments for epilepsy. Neurocrine Biosciences has an exclusive license to XEN901, now known as NBI-921352, a clinical stage selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor, and an exclusive license to pre-clinical compounds for development, including selective Nav1.6 inhibitors and dual Nav1.2/1.6 inhibitors. The agreement also included a multi-year research collaboration to discover, identify and develop additional novel Nav1.6 and Nav1.2/1.6 inhibitors. For a more detailed description of the terms of this agreement with Neurocrine Biosciences, see “—Collaborations, Commercial and License Agreements” below.   
 NBI-921352 is a potent, highly selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor being developed to treat pediatric patients with SCN8A developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, or SCN8A-DEE, and other potential indications, including adult focal epilepsy. Prior to our license and collaboration agreement with Neurocrine Biosciences, we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adult subjects, and subsequently developed a pediatric-specific, granule formulation. The FDA has provided feedback on an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application submitted by Neurocrine Biosciences in support of a Phase 2 clinical trial in SCN8A-DEE patients. Based on this feedback, Neurocrine Biosciences anticipates initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial in adolescent patients (aged 12 years and older) with SCN8A-DEE in the third quarter of 2021, and the trial protocol will be amended to include younger pediatric patients (aged 2-11 years) with SCN8A-DEE as soon as the FDA has reviewed and approved additional non-clinical information. In parallel, Neurocrine Biosciences is advancing clinical plans to develop NBI-921352 for the treatment of adult focal epilepsy and expects to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2021. Upon IND or equivalent regulatory acceptance for NBI-921352 in adult focal epilepsy, we are eligible to receive a $10.0 million milestone payment; upon FDA acceptance of a protocol amendment for NBI-921352 in pediatric patients (aged 2-11 years) with SCN8A-DEE, we are eligible to receive a $25.0 million milestone payment, or a $15.0 million milestone payment if the IND acceptance for adult focal epilepsy occurs first. Both milestone payments are in the form of 45% cash and a 55% equity investment in our common shares at a 15% premium to our 30-day trailing volume weighted average price at that time.

FX301, A Nav1.7 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Post-Operative Pain 
 In September 2019, we entered into an agreement providing Flexion with the global rights to develop and commercialize XEN402, now known as FX301, a Nav1.7 inhibitor. Flexion’s FX301 program consists of XEN402 formulated for extended release from a thermosensitive hydrogel. The initial development of FX301 is intended to support administration as a peripheral nerve block for control of post-operative pain. In February 2021, the FDA cleared an IND for FX301, resulting in a $1.0 million milestone payment due to us, and Flexion anticipates initiating a Phase 1b proof-of-concept clinical trial of popliteal fossa block with FX301 in patients undergoing bunionectomy in the first half of 2021. Topline results from that trial could potentially be available in late 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we are eligible to receive up to an additional $7.0 million in milestone payments through initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial. For a more detailed description of the terms of this agreement with Flexion, see “—Collaborations, Commercial and License Agreements” below. 
 Selective Inhibitors of Nav1.7 for the Treatment of Pain
 In December 2011, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with Genentech to discover and develop selective oral inhibitors of Nav1.7 for the treatment of pain. For a more detailed description of the terms of our agreements with Genentech, see “—Collaborations, Commercial and License Agreements” below. Based on our discovery of Nav1.7 deficiency underlying the rare human disease called congenital indifference to pain, or CIP, where individuals with CIP are unable to feel pain, we believe that Nav1.7 is a highly validated target for the treatment of pain. Our Genentech collaboration is focused on discovering and developing oral drugs that selectively target Nav1.7.
 Collaborations, Commercial and License Agreements
 License and Collaboration Agreement with Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.
 On December 2, 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., or Neurocrine Biosciences, to establish a collaboration under which the parties will identify, research and develop sodium channel inhibitors, including our clinical candidate XEN901, now known as NBI-921352, and preclinical candidates XEN393, XPC’535 and XPC’391, which compounds Neurocrine Biosciences will have the exclusive right to further develop and commercialize under the terms and conditions set forth in the Collaboration Agreement.

Collaboration Programs.  We are collaborating with Neurocrine Biosciences on the conduct of two collaboration programs: (i) a joint research collaboration to discover, identify and preclinically develop Research Compounds, or the Research Program, and (ii) a collaborative development program for XEN901 and two DTCs selected by the JSC, or the Initial Development Program and, together with the Research Program, referred to as the Collaboration Programs.  The Research Program is intended to include the preclinical development of our existing non-clinical Research Compounds and the discovery of new back-up and follow-on Research Compounds to XEN901 and the two DTCs selected by the JSC as clinical development candidates for subsequent development and commercialization by Neurocrine Biosciences.  During the term of the Research Program, the parties will conduct related activities in accordance with an agreed research plan and budget.  Each party will be solely responsible for all costs such party incurs to conduct its activities under the research plan, provided that Neurocrine Biosciences will reimburse us for certain full-time employees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by us in accordance with the research budget.  Unless earlier terminated or extended, the Research Program will end on the second anniversary of the Collaboration Agreement, or the Research Term, after which we will have no obligation to perform any further activities in furtherance of the Research Program.
 The Initial Development Program will include: (i) completion of any preclinical and clinical studies that are ongoing as the date of the Collaboration Agreement of any XEN901 product and the two DTC products selected by the JSC; (ii) a pharmacokinetic, drug-drug interaction and food effect Phase 1 clinical trial of a XEN901 product to examine the adequacy of a new pediatric formulation; and (iii) all preclinical studies of two DTC products containing the two DTCs selected by the JSC.  The parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the development activities under the Initial Development Program pursuant to specific development plans.  Each party will be solely responsible for all costs such party incurs to conduct its activities under these development plans, provided that, with respect to XEN901 development activities, Neurocrine Biosciences will reimburse us for certain full-time employees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by us, and with respect to certain development activities related to the two JSC-selected DTCs, the JSC may determine that Neurocrine Biosciences shall make such reimbursements.  
 Development, Regulatory and Manufacturing.  Except for the activities set forth in the plans for the Collaboration Programs, Neurocrine Biosciences will be solely responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for all development and manufacturing of the Compounds and any pharmaceutical product that contains a Compound, subject to the Co-Funding Option (as defined below).  For the first indication that meets or exceeds a specified prevalence threshold, or a Major Indication, for which Neurocrine Biosciences intends to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial of a XEN901 product or the first clinical trial of a DTC product following a successful Phase 2 clinical trial for such DTC product, Neurocrine Biosciences will prepare a development plan including an estimated budget and provide such plan to us.  We will have the right to elect to co-fund the development of one product in a Major Indication under such development plan and to receive a mid-single digit percentage increase in royalties owed on the net sales as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, or Net Sales, of such products in the United States, or the Co-Funding Option.  If we exercise the Co-Funding Option, the parties will share equally all reasonable and documented costs and expenses that Neurocrine Biosciences incurs in connection with the development of such product in the applicable indication, except costs and expenses that are solely related to the development of such product for regulatory approval outside the United States.
 Neurocrine Biosciences will be the regulatory sponsor and will be solely responsible for all regulatory activities (except for those delegated to us) under the Collaboration Agreement, including submitting one or more INDs for a XEN901 product.  If the FDA grants a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher in connection with the approval of a New Drug Application for a XEN901 product, Neurocrine Biosciences may, at its option, (i) sell it to a third party and share a specified portion of the proceeds with us; (ii) use it for a product Neurocrine Biosciences is developing outside the Collaboration Agreement and pay us a specified portion of the voucher’s intrinsic value (as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement); or (iii) use the voucher for a pharmaceutical product that contains a Compound, in which case no payments would be due to us.  If the FDA grants Neurocrine Biosciences a voucher in connection with any other product, Neurocrine Biosciences will retain all rights to such voucher without any payment or other obligations to us.
 Commercialization.  Neurocrine Biosciences will have the exclusive right to conduct, and will be solely responsible for all aspects of, the commercialization of any pharmaceutical product that contains a Compound.
 Financial Terms.  Neurocrine Biosciences paid us an upfront payment of $50.0 million, which included a $30.0 million payment in cash. For the remainder of the upfront payment, concurrently with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, the parties entered into the Share Purchase Agreement (as defined below) pursuant to which we issued and sold the Shares (as defined below) to Neurocrine Biosciences for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million.
 The Collaboration Agreement also provides for potential aggregate development and regulatory milestone payments from Neurocrine Biosciences to us of up to $325.0 million for a XEN901 product and up to $247.5 million for each other Compound up to a maximum of three other Compounds.  Sales-based milestones of up to $150.0 million for each Compound, including a XEN901 product, will be paid from Neurocrine Biosciences to us upon the achievement of certain Net Sales targets, up to a maximum of four Compounds.
 
8


Neurocrine Biosciences has further agreed to pay us royalties based on future Net Sales of any pharmaceutical product that contains a Compound.  Such royalty percentages, for Net Sales in and outside the United States, range from (i) for a XEN901 product, a low double-digit percentage to a mid-teen percentage and a high-single digit percentage to low double-digit percentage, respectively; (ii) for each DTC product, a high-single digit percentage to a low double-digit percentage and a mid-single digit percentage to a high-single digit percentage, respectively; and (iii) for each Research Compound product, a mid-single digit percentage to a high-single digit percentage and a tiered mid-single digit percentage, respectively.
 Neurocrine Biosciences’s obligations to pay royalties with respect to a product and country will expire upon the latest of: (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim in (a) the parties’ joint patent rights filed during the Research Term or a specified period of time thereafter or (b) our patent rights as specified in the Collaboration Agreement, in each case that cover such product; (ii) ten years from the first commercial sale of the product in such country; and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or the Royalty Term.  Royalty payments are subject to reduction in specified circumstances, including expiration of patent rights or if average Net Sales decrease by a certain percentage after the introduction of a generic product.
 Term and Termination.  Unless earlier terminated, the term of the Collaboration Agreement will continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the Royalty Term for such product in such country.  Upon the expiration of the Royalty Term for a particular product and country, the exclusive license granted by us to Neurocrine Biosciences with respect to such product and country will become fully-paid, royalty free, perpetual and irrevocable.
 Neurocrine Biosciences may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis, for any or no reason, by providing at least 90 days’ written notice, provided that such unilateral termination will not be effective (i) with respect to a XEN901 product until Neurocrine Biosciences has used its commercially reasonable efforts to complete one Phase 2 clinical trial for a XEN901 product; (ii) with respect to a DTC product until Neurocrine Biosciences has used its commercially reasonable efforts to complete one Phase 1 clinical trial for a DTC product; and (iii) with respect to the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety until Neurocrine Biosciences has used its commercially reasonable efforts to complete both of these clinical trials.  Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in the event of a material breach in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions.  If Neurocrine Biosciences is entitled to terminate the Collaboration Agreement due to our uncured material breach, in lieu of termination, Neurocrine Biosciences may elect to reduce all subsequent payments owing from Neurocrine Biosciences to us by half.
 Upon the termination of the Collaboration Agreement for any reason, all licenses and other rights granted to Neurocrine Biosciences by us shall terminate, provided that if termination is solely with respect to one or more products or countries, then such termination will apply only to the terminated products or countries.  Upon termination in certain cases, Neurocrine Biosciences has agreed to grant us licenses to certain Neurocrine Biosciences intellectual property that is reasonably necessary, and that was actually used by Neurocrine Biosciences for the development, manufacturing or commercialization of the terminated products, to research, develop and commercialize the terminated products in the terminated countries.  Such license will be royalty-free with respect to any terminated product for which a Phase 2 clinical trial was not completed prior to the effective date of termination, and otherwise will be royalty-bearing ranging from a low-single digit percentage to a high-single digit percentage depending on the stage of development of the applicable product at the effective date of termination.
 The Collaboration Agreement includes certain other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations and warranties, indemnification and confidentiality provisions.
 In January 2021, we entered into an amendment with Neurocrine Biosciences pursuant to which we revised certain IND acceptance criteria relating to XEN901 for the potential treatment of SCN8A-DEE. Under the terms of the amendment, a partial IND acceptance, or Partial IND Acceptance, for XEN901 in the SCN8A-DEE indication will be deemed to have occurred upon the authorization of the FDA to initiate a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of XEN901 in subjects with SCN8A-DEE aged between 12 and 21 years. A full IND acceptance, or Full IND Acceptance, for XEN901 in the SCN8A-DEE indication will be deemed to have occurred upon FDA approval of a protocol amendment to the study that expands the subject population to include subjects with SCN8A-DEE aged between 2 and 11 years. If XEN901 achieves Full IND Acceptance in SCN8A-DEE or IND or equivalent regulatory authority acceptance in a Major Indication, we will be entitled to a milestone cash payment of $11.25 million or $4.5 million, respectively. In addition to such cash payment, we will issue and sell either $13.75 million or $5.5 million of our common shares to Neurocrine, depending on whether the IND acceptance is for SCN8A-DEE or a Major Indication, respectively.  The common shares sold to Neurocrine will have a price equal to 115% of our 30-day volume-weighted average price immediately prior to the public announcement of the IND acceptance. If the IND acceptance first occurs for a Major Indication and subsequently Full IND Acceptance for XEN901 in SCN8A-DEE occurs, Neurocrine will pay us an additional $6.75 million cash payment (for a total of $11.25 million) and an additional $8.25 million (for a total of $13.75 million) of common shares will be issued and sold to Neurocrine at a price equal to 115% of our 30-day volume-weighted average price immediately prior to the public announcement of the subsequent IND acceptance.  If the aggregate number of common shares to be sold to Neurocrine pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, as amended, would exceed 19.9% of our common shares outstanding on the date of the Collaboration Agreement, then the number of shares to be purchased shall be reduced such that the percentage cap is not exceeded.

Share Purchase Agreement
 On December 2, 2019, pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Neurocrine Biosciences, or the Share Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we issued and sold 1,408,847 of our common shares, or the Shares, to Neurocrine Biosciences in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million, or $14.196 per share.  The purchase price represented a 20% premium to the closing price of our common shares on November 29, 2019.  
 The Shares are subject to lock-up restrictions, which, without prior approval of us, prohibit Neurocrine Biosciences from selling the Shares for a period of up to two years after the effective date of the Collaboration Agreement.  In addition, Neurocrine Biosciences is, subject to certain exceptions, subject to a standstill agreement for a period of two years after the effective date of the Collaboration Agreement.  Pursuant to the standstill agreement, Neurocrine Biosciences and its affiliates will not (1) acquire, offer to acquire or agree to acquire any of our common shares or securities convertible into common shares, other than common shares issuable to Neurocrine Biosciences pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement; (2)  make, or participate in, any solicitation of proxies to vote any of our or our subsidiaries’ voting securities, or propose to change or control our management or board of directors by use of any public communication to holders of securities intended for such purpose; (3) make a public proposal for a change of control; or (4) knowingly encourage, accept, or support a tender, exchange, or offer proposal by any person, which would result in a change of control.  The Share Purchase Agreement contains certain other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations, warranties, and covenants.
 Asset Purchase Agreement with Flexion Therapeutics, Inc.
 On September 9, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Flexion Therapeutics, Inc. pursuant to which Flexion acquired all rights with respect to our investigational compound XEN402 and a related compound, including certain regulatory documentation, intellectual property rights, reports, data and all quantities of XEN402 owned or controlled by us. XEN402 is a sodium channel inhibitor that we had previously developed with our collaborator, Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH and its affiliated entities.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Flexion also assumed certain liabilities relating to the purchased assets, including the obligation to pay a low single-digit percentage royalty to Teva on net sales of any approved products incorporating XEN402.
 Flexion paid an upfront purchase price of $3.0 million for the purchased assets and a $0.5 million milestone payment for the initiation of the first GLP toxicology study. In addition, a $1.0 million milestone for FDA clearance of the first IND has been achieved in the first quarter of 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we are eligible to receive additional payments for various CMC, development and regulatory milestones of up to $7.0 million through initiation of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial.  In addition, following a successful proof-of-concept clinical trial, we would be eligible to receive additional clinical development and global regulatory approval milestone payments of up to $40.75 million, commercialization milestone payments of up to $75.0 million, as well as future royalties on sales of any approved products ranging from mid-single to low-double digit percentages, depending on the level of worldwide net sales.
 The agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a covenant by us not to develop a competing product for the treatment of post-surgical pain and a covenant by Flexion not to develop a product for the treatment of epilepsy incorporating XEN402. Each party has agreed, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify the other party for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants and for losses arising from certain assumed/excluded liabilities, as applicable.
 Asset Purchase Agreement with 1st Order Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 In April 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with 1st Order Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or 1st Order, pursuant to which we acquired all rights with respect to XEN1101 (previously known as 1OP2198). 1st Order previously acquired 1OP2198 from Valeant Pharmaceuticals Luxembourg S.a.r.l., an indirect subsidiary of Bausch Health Companies Inc., together with Valeant Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, Bausch Health, and assumed certain obligations, including potential milestone and royalty payments. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, we paid 1st Order an upfront fee of approximately $0.4 million and a $0.7 million milestone in 2017 upon achieving a clinical development milestone. 
 In September 2018, we signed an agreement with Bausch Health to buy out all future milestone payments and royalties owed to Bausch Health with respect to XEN1101, including up to $39.6 million in potential clinical development, regulatory and sales-based milestones and a mid-to-high single digit percentage royalty on commercial sales in exchange for a one-time payment of $6.0 million. 
 In August 2020, we entered into an amendment to the asset purchase agreement to amend certain definitions in the agreement and to modify the payment schedule for certain milestones. Upon execution of the amendment, we made a payment of $0.3 million to 1st Order. We remain responsible for future potential payments to 1st Order of up to $1.2 million in clinical development milestones, up to $6 million in regulatory milestones for multiple indications, and $0.5 million in other milestones. There are no royalty obligations to 1st Order.

Agreements with Genentech for Selective Inhibitors of Nav1.7 and Pain Genetics
 In December 2011, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to discover and develop small and large molecules that selectively inhibit the Nav1.7 sodium channel and companion diagnostics for the potential treatment of pain. Pursuant to this agreement, we granted Genentech a worldwide exclusive license to develop and commercialize compounds directed to Nav1.7 and products incorporating such compounds for all uses. We also granted Genentech a worldwide non-exclusive license to diagnostic products for the purpose of developing or commercializing such compounds.
 Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech paid us an upfront fee of $10.0 million, a $5.0 million milestone payment for the selection of a compound for development and an $8.0 million milestone payment upon the approval by Health Canada of a CTA. Genentech provided funding to us for certain of our full-time equivalents, or FTEs, performing the research collaboration plan, which concluded in December 2016. We are eligible to receive pre-commercial and commercial milestone payments with respect to the licensed products totaling up to an additional $613.0 million, comprised of up to $45.5 million in pre-clinical and clinical milestone payments, up to $387.5 million in regulatory milestone payments, and up to $180.0 million in sales-based milestone payments for multiple products and indications. In addition, we are eligible to receive royalties based on net sales of the licensed products, which range from a mid-single-digit percentage to ten percent for small-molecule inhibitors for the timeframe that such products are covered by the licensed patents and a low single-digit percentage thereafter until the date that is ten years after first commercial sale on a country-by-country basis, plus a low single-digit percentage for large molecule inhibitors of Nav1.7 for a period of ten years from first commercial sale on a country-by-country basis. Our pre-commercial and commercial milestone payments and royalties may be subject to reductions based on the period in which the compound that is selected for development and commercialization was initially conceived. If the compound that is selected for development and commercialization was conceived after December 21, 2019, we will not be entitled to any pre-commercial or commercial milestone payments nor to any royalties. 
 Our agreement with Genentech expires on the date of the expiration of all payment obligations to us under the agreement. Genentech may terminate the agreement with three months advance notice anytime on or after the third anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, and each party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured after 90 days. In the event that Genentech terminates the agreement due to our breach, Genentech retains its licenses and its payment obligations to us are reduced. In the event that we terminate the agreement due to Genentech’s breach, the rights and licenses granted to Genentech revert back to us, subject to certain rights to make and use certain large-molecule product candidates that are retained by Genentech, and Genentech is obligated to assign certain regulatory approvals and grant certain licenses to us to enable us to develop and commercialize certain terminated products outside of the collaboration.
 Our collaborative research and license agreement with Genentech has been amended multiple times, in May 2015, November 2015, March 2016, May 2017, July 2018 and September 2018, to either extend the term of the research program or to provide us with greater flexibility in developing compounds that target Nav1.6. Pursuant to the current amendment, we have obtained a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, world-wide, sublicensable license under the know-how forming part of the Genentech intellectual property developed under the Nav1.7 collaboration that is necessary or useful to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import compounds from our Nav1.6 program that are above a certain potency on Nav1.7 and were conceived prior to a certain date and products containing those compounds. Our license from Genentech includes commercialization rights but we are restricted from developing or commercializing our Nav1.6 compounds below a certain potency on Nav1.7 and conceived prior to a certain date in the field of epilepsy and any of our Nav1.6 compounds conceived prior to a certain date, regardless of their potency on Nav1.7, in the field of pain. In exchange for the rights granted to us under this amendment, Genentech is eligible to receive a low single-digit percentage, tiered royalty on net sales of our Nav1.6 compounds conceived prior to a certain date, including XEN901 (now known as NBI-921352), for a period of ten years from first commercial sale on a country-by-country basis. In accordance with our license and collaboration agreement with Neurocrine Biosciences, we remain solely responsible for all payments to Genentech with respect to certain Nav1.6 compounds, including NBI-921352, licensed to Neurocrine Biosciences. Pursuant to the amendment, we granted Genentech a royalty-free, non-exclusive, world-wide license under our Nav1.6 intellectual property to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import compounds below a certain potency on Nav1.7 and products containing those compounds for all uses and indications except epilepsy. 
 In March 2014, we entered into an additional agreement with Genentech for pain genetics, which focused on identifying genetic targets associated with rare phenotypes where individuals have an inability to perceive pain or where individuals have non-precipitated spontaneous severe pain. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, any intellectual property arising out of the collaboration will be jointly owned by us and Genentech. We also granted Genentech a time-limited, exclusive right of first negotiation on a target-by-target basis to form joint drug discovery collaborations. Under the terms of this agreement, Genentech paid us an upfront payment of $1.5 million and two $0.25 million milestone payments related to the identification of novel pain targets in September 2015 and July 2017. Genentech’s time-limited, exclusive right of first negotiation, which was exercisable throughout the research term, expired at the same time as the agreement in March 2018. Despite such termination, we remain eligible for up to an additional $1.5 million in milestone payments.

Intellectual Property 
 As part of our business strategy, we generally file patent applications disclosing and claiming drug targets and their novel uses, novel compositions that modulate such targets, methods of making and using such compositions and various therapeutic formulations of such compositions that cover our product candidates. In some cases, we also file claims on screening assays as well as compositions and methods for use in diagnosing certain diseases. We generally file applications in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, or EU, and other commercially significant foreign jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties to develop, maintain and protect our competitive position. Our ability to be competitive will depend on the success of this strategy.
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned, co-owned or licensed 32 issued U.S. patents and approximately 21 pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings. We also owned, co-owned or licensed an additional 227 pending and granted counterpart applications worldwide, including 20 country-specific validations of three European patents.
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned two issued U.S. patents and four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications related to XEN1101, and methods of making and using XEN1101 and certain related compounds. The issued patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2029 (absent any extensions of term). In addition, we have 15 foreign issued patents (exclusive of European patent national validations), three pending PCT international applications, and 30 pending corresponding applications in various foreign jurisdictions relating to XEN1101 and certain related compounds.
 As of December 31, 2020, we have filed one U.S. non-provisional patent application directed to XEN496 (i.e., our pediatric formulation of ezogabine), a genus of related formulations, and methods of making and using the same.  In addition, we have one pending PCT international application relating to XEN496 and related intellectual property. Any patents issuing from this application are expected to expire in 2040 (absent any extensions of term).
 As of December 31, 2020, we co-owned one U.S. provisional patent application directed to methods of using XEN007 for the treatment of certain pediatric epilepsy disorders.  Any patents issuing from this application are expected to expire in 2041 (absent any extensions of term).
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned three U.S. patents, one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, and four U.S. provisional patent applications directed to XEN901 (now known as NBI-921352) and methods of making and using XEN901 and certain related compounds. The issued patents, along with any patents issuing from these applications, are expected to expire between 2037 and 2041 (absent any extensions of term).  In addition, we have 21 pending corresponding applications in various foreign jurisdictions relating to XEN901 and certain related compounds. Pursuant to our collaboration with Neurocrine Biosciences, Neurocrine Biosciences will oversee the prosecution, maintenance and other matters relating to the patent portfolio for XEN901 (now known as NBI-921352) and the other selective Nav1.6 inhibitors and dual Nav1.2/1.6 inhibitors.
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned two U.S. patents, filed three U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two PCT international applications, and 58 pending corresponding applications in various foreign jurisdictions directed to certain of our selective inhibitors of Nav1.6 and/or Nav1.2 (exclusive of XEN901), as well as methods of making and using the same. The issued patents, along with any patents issuing from these applications are expected to expire between 2037 and 2039 (absent any extensions of term).
 As of December 31, 2020, we, together with Genentech, co-owned nine issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, six foreign issued patents (exclusive of European patent national validations), and have filed 69 pending counterpart patent applications in various jurisdictions directed to Nav1.7 inhibitors, as well as methods of making and using the same. The issued patents, as well as any patents issuing from these applications are expected to expire between 2034 and 2037 (absent any extensions of term).
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and drug discovery approach provide us with certain advantages, we face potential competition in our discovery and product development efforts from many different approaches and sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates or products that we or our collaborators successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
 
12


Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we, or our collaborators, do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large and established companies.
 Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Health Canada or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payers.
 Aside from the product marketplace, our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, recruiting patients for clinical trials, and by acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of alternative products, the level of competition and the availability of coverage, and adequate reimbursement from government and other third party payers. Our product candidates that are in clinical development may compete with various therapies and drugs, both in the marketplace and currently under development.
 Anti-Seizure Medications, or ASMs, for the Treatment of Epilepsy 
 If more than one of our proprietary or partnered products were approved for the treatment of epilepsy, we anticipate that they could potentially compete with one another and other ASMs. Currently prescribed ASMs, among others, include phenytoin, levetiracetam, brivaracetam, carbamazepine, cenobamate, clobazam, lamotrigine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, lacosamide, ethosuximide, perampanel, cannabidiol, eslicarbazepine acetate and fenfluramine. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically indicated for the early infantile epileptic encephalopathies KCNQ2-DEE or SCN8A-DEE; however, a number of different ASMs are currently used in these patient populations. We are not aware of other companies that are developing selective Nav1.6 inhibitors for the treatment of epilepsy. There are other ASMs in clinical development that could potentially compete with our products, including products in development from Eisai Co., Ltd., GW Pharmaceuticals plc, Knopp Biosciences LLC, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Ovid Therapeutics Inc., Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc., Sage Therapeutics, SK Life Science, Inc., Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., UCB, Inc., and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc., Zogenix, Inc., and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
 Government Regulation 
 We are developing small-molecule product candidates, which are regulated as drugs by the FDA and equivalent regulatory authorities outside the U.S. Within the FDA, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, regulates drugs. Drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and other federal, provincial, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The FD&C Act and corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving drugs. FDA approval of an IND application must be obtained before clinical testing of drugs is initiated, and each clinical study protocol for such product candidates is reviewed by the FDA and IRB prior to initiation in the U.S. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of drugs in the U.S. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, provincial, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 The process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13



 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for drug products for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety and efficacy based on large scale phase 3 clinical studies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to consistently manufacture the product pursuant to regulatory requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients that have the condition or disease being studied.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine a dose range and dosing schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosing and dosing schedule, clinical efficacy, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators.
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for ensuring the quality, identity, strength, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its labeled shelf life.
 Further, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, the FDA has issued guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, which describes a number of considerations for sponsors of clinical trials impacted by the pandemic, including certain reporting requirements, and additional guidance on the good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection and other topics. We may be required to make further adjustments to our clinical trials or business operations based on current or future guidance and regulatory requirements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical studies of a drug, FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the drug. The NDA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for drugs and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any marketing application that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information, including additional clinical data. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMPs. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS, if required.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the marketing application, the FDA will issue a Complete Response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the Complete Response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a Complete Response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval will be limited to the specific diseases and dosages studied in clinical trials or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing pursuant to a REMS request, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval.
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to complete its review of 90% of standard new molecular entity, or NME, NDAs within ten months from the filing date and 90% of priority NME NDAs within six months from the filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the application sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 
15


Fast Track Designation
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, which are intended to expedite the process for the development and review of drugs. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to expedite the FDA’s review of drugs that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Under the Fast Track process, drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, may also receive priority review by the FDA, or review within six months of the filing of an NDA compared to a traditional review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval of a drug, and may not result in a faster approval, if approval is granted, for Fast Track designated drugs, the FDA will also attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug, to expedite such drug’s review and development.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for XEN496 (active ingredient ezogabine), a drug we are evaluating in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of KCNQ2-DEE. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Orphan drug products may also be eligible for RPD designation if greater than 50% of patients living with the disease are under age 19 and the condition affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. A priority review voucher will be given to the sponsor of a product with an RPD designation at the time of product approval that is transferable to another company. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such drug for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product for the same orphan indication as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same orphan indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits, including up to ten years of exclusivity.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of drug continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to drug manufacturers, include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the safety, efficacy or quality of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. 
 
16


We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in or are otherwise inconsistent with the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a drug product containing a new chemical entity as its active ingredient is entitled to five years of market exclusivity, and a product whose active ingredient was previously FDA approved, and for which the sponsor is required to generate new clinical data is entitled to three years of market exclusivity. A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the timely, voluntary, and as-agreed upon completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, provincial, state and federal U.S. and Canadian laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.

Global Anti-Corruption Laws
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the U.S. Travel Act, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, Title 18 United States Code section 201, and any other applicable domestic or foreign anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws to which we are subject prohibit corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We may also be held liable for the acts of our third party agents under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, whistleblower complaints, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. Any investigations, actions or sanctions or other previously mentioned harm could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 Government Regulation Outside of the U.S.
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drugs, and reimbursement requirements. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed. Similar requirements regarding a CTA and ethics approval exist in Canada.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, coverage, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 is intended to ensure that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU are identical; however, it has not yet been fully implemented.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. Reimbursement approval for the drug by regulatory authorities is also required before a drug may be commercialized. The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
 
18


The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
  
• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 For other countries outside of the EU, such as Canada and countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product and establishment licensing, coverage, data protection, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, inability to import or export, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, managed care plans, private health insurers, and other organizations. These third-party payers may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Third-party payers may attempt to control costs by limiting coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication, and by limiting the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Some third-party payers also require pre-approval or prior authorization of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who prescribe such therapies or patients who use such prescription drugs. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.
 
19


In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third-party payers, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
 In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the Medicare Modernization Act, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The Medicare Modernization Act expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly by establishing Medicare Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs under Medicare Part B. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class under the new Medicare Part D program. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that our customers receive for any of our approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
 Enacted in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or PPACA, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, PPACA revises the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the PPACA also imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. These new laws may result in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. For example, in 2020, HHS and CMS issued various rules that are expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of these new rules. In January 2021, the Biden administration issued a “regulatory freeze” memorandum that directs department and agency heads to review new or pending rules of the prior administration. It is unclear whether these new regulations will be withdrawn or when they will become fully effective under the current administration. The impact of these lawsuits as well as legislative, executive, and administrative actions of the current administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear.
 We expect that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenue. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
 
20


Since its enactment, there remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. Any changes to the PPACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the District Court. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on this case and is expected to decide on this case by mid-2021. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme Court will rule on this case. We cannot predict how this decision or future litigation will impact our business, or what other healthcare measures and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or their effect on our business.
 In addition, different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may be marketed only once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. Some of these countries may require, as condition of obtaining reimbursement or pricing approval, the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products that we are developing are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with applicable health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, Stark law, and implementing regulations, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Other laws and regulations that may apply to prescription drug manufacturers include the Sunshine Act, prescription drug price reporting requirements, and various state transparency and reporting laws. All business activities of prescription drug manufacturers are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute can be applied broadly to include arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and any referral source on the other, including prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, and service fees, unless expressly exempted or protected by a safe harbor. Further, the statute has been interpreted to cover any arrangement where one purpose of the remuneration was to obtain remuneration in exchange for referral or to induce further referrals for an item or service. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain legitimate business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria of an applicable safe harbor for protection from liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that the government does not need to prove that a person had the intent to specifically violate the statute in order to find a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not expressly provide for certain safe harbors or impose different requirements for safe harbor protection under applicable state laws.
 
21


The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted or cause to be submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, provincial, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including jurisdictions in which we conduct our clinical trials. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 In addition, in May 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which applies to all EU member states from May 25, 2018 and replaced the European Union Data Protection Directive. The GDPR has imposed many new or additional requirements including, but not limited to, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the nature and scope of notifications provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and using third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. Failure to comply with the GDPR could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution and/or civil fines or penalties. Additionally, GDPR creates a direct cause of action by individual data subjects. The GDPR is a complex law and the regulatory guidance is still evolving, including with respect to how the GDPR should be applied in the context of clinical trials or other transactions from that we may gain access to personal data. Beginning in 2021, the UK will be a “third country” under the GDPR. These changes in the law will increase our costs of compliance and result in greater legal risks. Other countries maintain different privacy laws that we are subject to.
 
22


The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, requires applicable manufacturers and certain distributors of prescription drugs, among other products, that are available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership (including immediate family ownership) and investment interests in the entity. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting and transparency requirements will extend to include payments and transfers of value made during the previous year to certain non-physician covered recipients, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. There are also an increasing number of state and local “sunshine” or transparency and reporting laws that require applicable manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. The U.S. federal government discloses the reported information on a publicly available website. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. These federal, state, and local laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 Because of the breadth of these health care laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and corporate integrity agreement, which impose certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country or if we contract with vendors or independent contractors outside of the U.S., we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-approval requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws,  anti-kickback laws, healthcare fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. While we are not aware of any current issues, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under applicable healthcare laws, or the impact of such actions on our business. However, the costs of defending such actions or claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
 Environmental Matters
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of federal, provincial and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of the regulations under the current regulatory structure provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or someone else’s, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or development of new regulations will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance.
Human Capital
 Our board of directors and management recognize that creating long term enterprise value is advanced by considering the interests and concerns of many stakeholders, including the Company’s employees. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 129 employees, including 122 full-time and part-time permanent employees, of which 108 are located in Canada and 14 are located in the United States. Of our employees, 90 were primarily engaged in research and development, 38 of whom hold a Ph.D. or M.D. (or equivalent) degree. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

As competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field is intense, attracting and retaining qualified employees at all levels is critical to our business. We have established comprehensive and competitive compensation, leave and benefits programs in order to attract and retain the highly qualified personnel essential to our business. In addition to providing our employees with competitive salaries, we believe that employees should share in the potential financial gains resulting from the advancement of our programs and our practice is to award stock options to permanent employees, both upon initial hiring and annually thereafter, and pay annual bonuses to permanent employees based on the achievement of corporate and/or personal objectives. Our leave programs include paid vacation, personal, sick, disability and other paid and unpaid leaves. Our health and wellness programs include medical, dental, vision care, retirement savings programs and other benefits.  
 As a biopharmaceutical company with highly educated employees, we believe that our employees must stay current with advances in our industry and continue to grow in their careers.  We offer a variety of internal training and development opportunities as well as dedicated resources for colleagues to attend conferences and external professional development programs.
 We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, at all levels of our company and in 2020, established a joint management/employee DEI Committee to progress this important issue.  We will continue to focus on measuring and extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We recruit the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to comply with all applicable laws related to discrimination in the workplace. 
 Finally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to provide many of our employees the option to work from home, implemented a halt of non-essential business travel since March 2020, and offered employees the ability to access additional paid days off for child, elder and/or self-care.  As some of our employees have transitioned back to our premises to continue critical on-site work, we have implemented additional safety and infection prevention measures including enhanced cleaning, additional personal protective equipment, and contact tracing protocols. 
 Manufacturing
 We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties and our collaborators for the manufacture of our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Accordingly, we have not internally developed any manufacturing facilities or hired related personnel.
 To date, we have obtained materials for our product candidates from multiple third-party manufacturers. We believe that all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates can be obtained from more than one source. However, the manufacturing processes for each of our product candidates vary and sourcing adequate supplies may be made more difficult depending on the type of product candidate involved. Our product candidates generally can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials, excipients and packaging components. The drug substance chemistry generally is amenable to scale-up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing processes.
