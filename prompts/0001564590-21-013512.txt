Item 1. Business. 
 Our mission is to improve every patient’s lung disease care by empowering physicians with swift, comprehensive and actionable insights.
 Our vision is to be a trusted business partner that the world relies on for data-driven diagnostics in lung disease and beyond.
 Business Overview
 Biodesix, Inc. (“Biodesix”, “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a leading data-driven diagnostic solutions company leveraging state of the art technologies with our proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) platform to discover, develop, and commercialize solutions for clinical unmet needs, with a primary focus in lung disease. By combining a technology agnostic approach with a holistic view of the patient’s disease state, we believe our solutions provide physicians with greater insights to help personalize their patient’s care and meaningfully improve disease detection, evaluation, and treatment. Our unique approach to precision medicine provides timely and actionable clinical information, which we believe improves overall patient outcomes and lowers the overall healthcare cost by reducing the use of ineffective and unnecessary treatments and procedures. In addition to our diagnostic tests, we provide biopharmaceutical companies with services that include diagnostic research, clinical trial testing, and the discovery, development, and commercialization of companion diagnostics.
 Our core belief is that no single technology will answer all clinical questions that we encounter. Therefore, we employ multiple technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and radiomics, and leverage our proprietary AI platform, the Diagnostic Cortex®, to discover innovative diagnostic tests for clinical use. Because of this approach, we believe we are unique in the diagnostics market as this approach allows for a broader and more holistic understanding of each patient’s disease state. Our data-driven and technology agnostic approach is designed to enable us to discover diagnostic tests that answer critical clinical questions faced by physicians, researchers, and biopharmaceutical companies.
 We operate in a single segment and derive our revenue from two sources: (i) providing diagnostic testing services associated with blood-based lung and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) tests (Diagnostic Tests); and (ii) providing biopharmaceutical companies with services that include diagnostic research, clinical research, development and testing services generally provided outside the clinical setting and governed by individual contracts with third parties as well as development and commercialization of companion diagnostics (Services). We derived 90% and 71% of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, from our diagnostic testing business.
 We are dedicated to continuously publishing and presenting new data on the clinical validation and utility of our diagnostic tests. Since our inception, we have performed over 285,000 tests and continue to generate a large and growing body of clinical evidence. We have participated in 27 clinical studies, five of which are ongoing, and have published over 275 peer-reviewed publications and presentations. We have over 140,000 samples and data in our biobank, including tumor profiles and immune profiles, which are used for both internal and external research and development (R&D) initiatives.
 We have commercialized six diagnostic tests which are currently on market and we perform over 30 assays for research use as part of our laboratory services that have been used by over 50 biopharmaceutical customers and academic partners.
 Blood-Based Lung Tests
 We have four diagnostic blood-based tests across the lung cancer continuum of care, which generated $12.6 million and $17.3 million in revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.
  
• | Nodify XL2® and Nodify CDT™ tests, together marketed as part of our Nodify Lung™ Nodule Risk Assessment testing strategy, assess the risk of lung cancer to help identify the most appropriate treatment pathway. We believe we are the only company to offer two commercial blood-based tests to help physicians reclassify risk of malignancy in patients with suspicious lung nodules.

• | GeneStrat® and VeriStrat® tests, together marketed as part of our Biodesix Lung Reflex® testing strategy, are used following diagnosis of lung cancer to measure the presence of mutations in the tumor and the state of the patient’s immune system to establish the patient’s prognosis and help guide treatment decisions. The GeneStrat tumor profiling test and the VeriStrat immune profiling test have a three-day average turnaround time, providing physicians with timely results to facilitate treatment decisions.

COVID-19 Tests
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through our partnership with Bio-Rad, we commercialized the Biodesix WorkSafe™ testing program. We generated $28.3 million in revenue from COVID-19 testing during fiscal 2020. Our scientific diagnostic expertise, technologies, and existing commercial infrastructure enabled us to rapidly commercialize two United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-authorized tests, a part of our customizable WorkSafe™ program. Both diagnostic tests are owned and were developed by Bio-Rad and Bio-Rad has granted us permission to utilize both tests for commercial diagnostic services.
 In February 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary declared a public health emergency for COVID-19 which justified the authorization of emergency use of diagnostic tests for the detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19. The Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 Droplet Digital™ polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) test and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test have been granted FDA EUA pursuant to the current emergency declaration. The Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test was FDA EUA authorized on May 1, 2020, authorizing performance of the test in laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) to perform high complexity tests. The second test is the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test, which is an antibody test intended for detecting a B-cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection. The Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test was FDA EUA authorized on April 29, 2020. Medical products that are granted an EUA are only permitted to commercialize their products under the terms and conditions provided in the authorization. The FDA may revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, if the conditions for the issuance of the EUA are no longer met, or if other circumstances make revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety, and we cannot predict how long the EUAs for the SARS-CoV-2 tests will remain in place. Using the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab tests, we operate and have commercialized the Biodesix WorkSafe testing program.
 Prior to using the Bio-Rad tests as part of our WorkSafe testing program, we performed feasibility, verification, and validation studies, including developing software for process automation, sample accessioning, data management and reporting, all required to demonstrate the test operated as claimed by the manufacturer and as required by our certifying regulatory agencies for high complexity laboratory testing. We secured independent reference specimens run with EUA tests to validate these tests as fit for diagnostic use in our laboratories. Post-launch development support for these tests have included improvements in on-boarding new personnel, logistics of sample collection, sample receipt and data reporting, all required to support our testing program. Additional releases of the laboratory data management software are ongoing and planned for the foreseeable future.
 These tests are utilized by healthcare providers, including hospitals and nursing homes, and are also offered to businesses and educational systems to assist in their back-to-work or back-to-school strategies, a crucial element of restarting economic activity. During 2020, we announced multiple partnerships for COVID-19 testing and have entered into an agreement with the State of Colorado to be one of the diagnostic companies to support wide-spread COVID-19 testing for the State. Additionally, we oversee and manage onsite testing and validating testing for the Big Ten Conference athletic competitions.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and we expect will continue to disrupt, our non-COVID-19 testing operations. To protect the health and well-being of our workforce, partners, vendors and customers, we provide voluntary COVID-19 testing for employees working on-site, implemented social distance and building entry policies at work, restricted travel and facility visits, and followed the States of Colorado and Kansas’ public health orders and the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Employees who can perform their duties remotely are asked to work from home and those on site are asked to follow our social distance guidelines. Our sales, marketing and business development efforts have also been constrained by our operational response to the COVID-19 pandemic due to travel restrictions. We expect to continue to adjust our operational norms in an effort to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the coming months, including complying with government directives and guidelines as they are modified and supplemented.
 4


The COVID-19 pandemic also has started to negatively affect, and we expect will continue to negatively affect, our non-COVID-19 testing- related revenue and our clinical studies. For example, cancer patients may have more limited access to hospitals, healthcare providers and medical resources as they take steps to control the spread of COVID-19. Our biopharmaceutical customers are facing challenges in recruiting patients and in conducting clinical trials to advance their pipelines, for which our tests could be utilized. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in the latter half of March 2020, we have been receiving fewer samples for non-COVID-19 testing on a daily average basis from our clinical and biopharmaceutical customers than before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our clinical studies, such as our ongoing INSIGHT study and our recently launched ALTITUDE study, as well as our arrangements with our biopharmaceutical customers, are expected to take longer to complete than what we originally expected before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Conversely, we are also experiencing an increase in revenues related to an increase in the demand for our Biodesix WorkSafe testing program which generated revenue of $28.3 million during fiscal 2020 of which $21.4 million is attributable to the fourth quarter 2020. As a result, our operating costs to expand capacity for COVID-19 testing also increased substantially during 2020 and we expect that trend to continue into the first quarter of 2021. There is no assurance that our COVID-19 testing program will continue to be accepted by the market or that other diagnostic tests will become more accepted, produce quicker results or are more accurate. Further, the longevity and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain. If the pandemic were to dissipate, whether due to acquiring herd immunity based on previous natural infection, and the availability and rapid distribution of vaccines, the evolution of variant strains that impact diagnostic test performance, or otherwise, the need for a COVID-19 test could decrease significantly and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability. As a result, the increase in revenue due to any increase in demand for these diagnostic tests may not be indicative of our future revenue. See “Risk Factors” for a description of how the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our Market Opportunity
 Diagnostic Testing Market Size and Opportunity
 Despite significant advances over the last decade, lung cancer is still the deadliest type of cancer in both men and women in the United States today. While diagnostic testing has become routinely used at certain points in the lung cancer continuum of care (diagnosis, treatment and monitoring), we believe there is a substantial need for novel, advanced testing to improve on the current standard of care. We estimate that in the United States, the lung cancer continuum of care currently represents over 10 million annual testing opportunities, and is over a $27 billion market annually for testing alone.
 

Over the last two decades, the use of biomarker testing in clinical trials has increased, with 55% of oncology trials involving the use of biomarker testing in 2018 versus 15% in 2000. We believe the field of biomarker discovery and companion diagnostic development for biopharmaceutical therapeutics is set to continue growing as biopharmaceutical companies seek to de-risk their research and development pipelines and increase chances of drug development success. We estimate that the biopharmaceutical partnering and research opportunities represent over a $2 billion market annually.
 Lung Cancer Continuum of Care – Clinical Unmet Needs
 Standards of care in lung cancer have evolved rapidly over the past decade, along with our understanding of the disease. With the introduction of numerous treatment options, physicians need an ever-increasing amount of information in order to select the best treatment plan for each individual patient. We believe that the lung cancer continuum of care has a variety of clinical unmet needs ranging from initial diagnosis of lung cancer after discovery of a lung nodule to treatment guidance for early and advanced stage disease, and monitoring for disease progression.
  
• | Diagnosis: We estimate approximately 1.6 million new incidental lung nodules and potentially 4 million lung nodules from the adoption of screening could be identified annually in the United States. Following initial discovery of a nodule, patients are typically evaluated by a pulmonologist for risk of lung cancer before an invasive procedure is carried out to obtain a tissue sample to confirm diagnosis. This risk assessment is based on clinical factors such as the patient’s smoking history and age, and radiological features such as the size and location of the nodule, obtained from a computed tomography (CT) scan. On initial assessment, we estimate that approximately 80% of patients are identified as low to moderate risk (5-65%) where guideline recommendations for their care plan are unclear, often resulting in either overtreatment of patients with benign nodules or undertreatment in patients with cancer. An estimated 17% of patients with malignant nodules are initially sent to watchful waiting, where a follow-up CT scan is scheduled in three to six months, potentially delaying their diagnosis. Conversely, we estimate that 62% of biopsies and 35% of surgeries performed on lung nodules find benign disease, representing a significant overtreatment that incurs both risk and cost to the patient and their providers. We therefore believe that there is a clear clinical need for blood-based diagnostic testing to help improve the initial risk assessment of pulmonary nodules, helping direct patients to the relevant treatment pathway, and ultimately improving patient outcomes and saving costs to the system.

• | Treatment Guidance – Early Stage: We estimate that there are over 700,000 testing opportunities annually in the United States in early-stage lung cancer to assess a patient’s risk of recurrence following curative-intent surgery, and to detect potential target mutations for therapeutics. Depending on a patient’s risk of recurrence, they may also receive chemotherapy, radiotherapy or chemoradiation post-surgery. The assessment of risk of recurrence is primarily based on the stage of cancer at diagnosis, with stage I patients typically receiving no additional treatment beyond surgery. However, 20 to 40% of patients with stage I disease do still recur within five years following surgery, representing a sub-group of patients who may have benefitted from more intensive treatment protocol. We believe there is a clear clinical need for blood-based diagnostic testing prior to surgery to identify stage I patients who may benefit from a more intensive treatment protocol and we also believe there is the need for identifying stage II and IIIA patients where low risk patients may benefit from a less intensive treatment protocol. There have also been recent advances in the use of targeted therapies in early-stage lung disease. These therapies typically target specific genomic mutations or alterations found in some tumors. We believe there is therefore an emerging need for testing designed specifically for mutation detection in early-stage disease.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment Guidance – Advanced Stage: We estimate that there are over 3 million diagnostic testing opportunities annually in the United States to guide advanced stage lung cancer treatment decisions. With nearly 50 FDA-approved systemic treatment regimens listed in national treatment guidelines for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is an elevated need for personalized biomarkers to help physicians identify the right patient for the right treatment. Multiple tissue-based diagnostic tests have been approved to identify patients eligible for targeted therapies and immunotherapy; however, about 50% of patients do not have sufficient tissue collected following diagnosis to facilitate testing. To compound the issue, different molecular tests take varying amounts of time (days versus weeks) to report results back to the ordering physician, which often leads to treatment decisions being made on incomplete information. Therefore, we believe there is an imminent need for a blood-based testing solution that measures tumor mutations and the patient’s immune profile, to provide physicians with more comprehensive and timely information to assess the overall prognosis of the patient and personalize treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitoring: We estimate that there are over 800,000 testing opportunities in the United States for blood-based tumor and immune profiling to monitor for disease recurrence and progression in NSCLC patients. Unfortunately, advanced stage lung cancer is often terminal, so repeat tissue biopsy to assess the evolution of resistance mutations or to detect disease progression is not feasible from either a cost or risk perspective to the patient, which we believe demonstrates an important need for blood-based testing to help routinely monitor these patients. As a patient progresses through therapies, changes in their immune system occur and blood-based immune profiling could help physicians identify these changes prior to subsequent therapy selection.

Current Limitations in Biomarker Discovery and Companion Diagnostics
 We estimate the biopharmaceutical biomarker testing and companion diagnostic market opportunity is $2 billion annually. Over the last two decades, the use of biomarker testing in clinical trials has increased, with 55% of oncology trials involving the use of biomarker testing in 2018 versus 15% in 2000. From 2005 to 2015, a study identified that incorporating biomarkers into clinical development programs increased their probability of therapeutic success rate from phase 1 to FDA-approval by 570%, representing an increase from 1.6% without biomarkers to 10.7% with biomarkers. We believe the field of biomarker discovery and companion diagnostic development for biopharmaceutical therapeutics is set to continue growing as biopharmaceutical companies seek to de-risk their product development efforts and increase chances of drug development success. However, we believe as the market continues to advance, inherent limitations of both biomarker discovery and companion diagnostic development have become more apparent.
 Biomarker Discovery: There are many limitations with biomarker discovery in biopharmaceutical drug                development, including:
  
• | Biomarkers with clinical utility are difficult to discover and validate in independent datasets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Classical statistical approaches to biomarker discovery are limited. Single-omic tests fail to see the whole biological picture.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7


 
• | Tissue biopsies are limited by the amount of a sample that can be collected: longitudinal testing is difficult and the biology is only from the profile of the tumor (host response is not accounted for).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical trials are expensive and take a long period of time. It is often difficult to meet enrollment goals for clinical trials with slow diagnostic testing turnaround times.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Companion Diagnostics (CDx): While developing companion diagnostics is critical to precision medicine, the promise of companion diagnostics has not been fully realized and there are multiple limitations that still need resolution. The path to co-develop a successful companion diagnostic with a corresponding drug has several challenges, including:
  
• | Traditional companion diagnostic agreements may fail to realize the full value of a testing opportunity, leading to difficulty in funding appropriate commercialization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug development is a lengthy, complex and costly process. There can be a financial impact to a pharmaceutical company to have a drug selected by a test.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current diagnostic reimbursement policies may not always support the coverage and payment of new companion diagnostics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory agencies continue to work on defining the co-development process, but the environment is continually changing.

The Diagnostic Cortex - Our Proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platform
 Our core belief is that no single technology will answer all clinical questions that we encounter. Therefore, we employ multiple technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and radiomics, and leverage our proprietary AI platform, the Diagnostic Cortex, to discover innovative diagnostic tests for clinical use. We focus on developing technologies that are capable of single and multi-omic research and development.
 The Diagnostic Cortex is an extensively validated deep learning platform optimized for the discovery of clinical diagnostic tests, which we believe overcomes standard machine learning challenges faced in life sciences research. Researchers commonly encounter issues with machine learning-based biological discoveries that cannot be repeated or validated when assessed in additional specimen cohorts. This challenge, commonly referred to as overfitting, occurs when the machine identifies a perfect pattern in an initial training dataset but is unable to identify the same pattern in a new dataset. For over 15 years we have focused on developing our platform to overcome this challenge through proprietary computational techniques to ensure each diagnostic test that is discovered can be further developed to perform consistently in the clinical testing environment.
 We are able to combine blood-based biological information related to the tumor, immune system, and host-status with clinical and radiomic data through our proprietary AI platform, which enables us to interpret the holistic disease state of each patient or clinical dataset we encounter.
 We continuously evolve and improve the Diagnostic Cortex platform. These improvements range from basic code optimization to complex improvements such as the incorporation of novel computational methods for the optimization of multi-omic diagnostic tests. Any AI platform is inherently limited without the highest quality data inputs. Therefore, all of the technologies that we employ have been chosen and developed to provide high-quality data to enable our Diagnostic Cortex platform. We feel that this level of data integrity is crucial for the development of diagnostic tests that require the advanced pattern matching abilities of deep learning algorithms. 
 We continuously incorporate new market insights and patient data to enhance our platform through a data-driven learning loop. We regularly engage  our customers, key opinion leaders, and scientific experts to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving diagnostic and therapeutic landscape and learn about biological discoveries that are clinically meaningful. Additionally, we incorporate clinical and molecular profiling data aggregated through our commercial clinical testing, research studies, clinical trials, and biopharmaceutical customers or academic partnerships, into our platform. We have over 140,000 samples and data in our biobank, including tumor profiles and immune profiles, which are used for both internal and external development initiatives. With our data-driven and technology agnostic approach as data inputs into the Diagnostic Cortex, we are able to discover diagnostic tests that answer critical clinical questions faced by physicians, researchers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

The following is a diagram outlining our innovative diagnostic test discovery, development and commercialization infrastructure as outlined in the text above.
 

We employ multiple technologies, as illustrated below, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and radiomics, generated by different assay techniques, including ddPCR, NGS, LC-MS, ELISA, and our proprietary DeepMALDI mass spectrometry platform for the blood-based molecular analysis of the tumor, immune system, and host-status of each patient and/or clinical dataset. Through our learning loop, we continuously revisit our technology strategy and roadmap to integrate new technologies into our evolving platform, which ultimately support the addition of new service and product revenue offerings. We focus on developing technologies that are capable of single and multi-omic research and development.
 

Most diagnostic companies focus their strategy on using a single technology to discover biomarkers for a broad range of clinical questions. We believe that no single technology can interrogate the complexity of the human disease state to help solve all clinical questions. For that reason, we employ a technology agnostic approach to solving diagnostic challenges leveraging our proprietary AI platform. Because of this approach, we believe we are unique in the diagnostics market, allowing for a broader and more holistic understanding of each patient’s disease state.
 We are experts in many technologies, but we are a true market leader with over 15 years of experience in the field of clinical proteomics. For over 10 years, we have been discovering and developing proteomic-based diagnostic tests and have a deep understanding of how to incorporate technologies that can be applied to blood samples in order to extract important protein-based biological information in the form of diagnostic tests, which can aid clinicians and scientists in understanding the dynamic biology of their system of interest, such as a patient with cancer.

Our suite of technologies that assist us in discovery, development and commercialization of novel diagnostic tests includes:
 DeepMALDI Mass Spectrometry
 We have developed DeepMALDI, a proprietary high-density matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry (MS) technology, to produce blood-based proteomic data for disease diagnosis, personalized health care, precision medicine for direct treatment options, and disease screening in lung and other disease states. DeepMALDI overcomes the limitations of conventional MALDI and other mass spectrometry methods to produce highly sensitive, stable, and reproducible data by: (1) utilizing optimized signal-to-noise reduction and signal processing algorithms; and (2) novel batch correction methods and spectral alignment methods. The combination of these improvements yields substantially higher quality data content and is thereby much better suited for the discovery of biomarkers with clinical utility.
 Our current DeepMALDI methods allow us to achieve finer mass resolution, greater sensitivity, and 20-times faster imaging speeds than other instruments. Additionally, we believe enhancements to our DeepMALDI methods and MALDI-ToF technology evolution will allow us to measure approximately 1,500 proteins, an improvement from the estimated 900 proteins we can measure today. We intend to maintain our leadership role in the discovery of proteomics-based diagnostic tests. We utilize our DeepMALDI and MALDI-ToF technologies in our discovery and development efforts and as part of our collaborations with our biopharmaceutical customers and academic partners.
 Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry MS
 We use Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) MS with triple quadrupole mass spectrometers and up-front liquid chromatography (LC) sample injection in the Nodify XL2 test. This mass spectrometry method offers highly sensitive, specific, and cost-effective analysis for simultaneous quantitation of hundreds to several thousands of targeted peptides in a single experiment. We have since included the MRM technologies as part of our services for discovery and development with our biopharmaceutical customers and academic partners.
 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
 ELISA is the most widely used ligand binding assay platform within and outside the pharmaceutical industry. Formats include direct, indirect and sandwich assays and are typically run in manually or semi-automated modes. We use a semi-automated implementation of ELISA in clinical testing for the Nodify CDT test and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test for COVID-19. The acquisition of Oncimmune USA in 2019 expanded our ability to conduct very high throughput and cost-effective ELISAs in our clinical testing laboratory. We have now included the ELISA technologies for research and development both internally and externally with our biopharmaceutical customers and academic partners.
Droplet Digital PCR Platform
 We use the ddPCR technology for multiplexed, semi-automated nucleic acid detection. This allows high sensitivity, fast turn-around times, flexibility in our laboratory workflows, rapid scaling from low to moderate analyte complexity, and high-volume scalability. ddPCR is an absolute quantitation method based on the partitioning of circulating nucleic acids into up to 20,000 droplets per reaction and is used for the GeneStrat test and Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test for COVID-19. We have included the ddPCR technologies for research and development both internally and externally with our biopharmaceutical customers and academic partners.
 Next Generation Sequencing Technology
 We use an NGS technology for broad genomic sequencing of clinical specimens. Our strategy with NGS relies on a menu of off-the-shelf and custom research use assays, which we develop and make available as a part of our biopharmaceutical test services. The NGS technology integrates automated systems to yield high sensitivity results with a rapid turnaround time. Since adoption of this technology, we have included the NGS technologies for research and development both internally and externally with our biopharmaceutical customers and academic partners.

Our Solutions and Products
 To help address the current limitations with standard of care in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, we use combinations of tumor, immune and host profiling, radiological imaging, patient clinical profiling, and our proprietary AI platform to provide a holistic view of each patient’s dynamic disease state.
 We have four blood-based diagnostic tests across the lung cancer continuum of care to help address clinical unmet needs by physicians.
 
 
• | Diagnosis: We believe there is a clinical need to help physicians reclassify risk of malignancy in patients presenting with suspicious lung nodules. We offer the blood-based Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment testing strategy to aid physicians in stratifying patients into distinct nodule management treatment pathways: diagnostic procedure or imaging surveillance. Nodify Lung consists of two blood-based proteomic tests: the Nodify CDT test helps identify patients with lung nodules that are likely malignant and the Nodify XL2 test conversely helps identify those that are likely benign.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment Guidance: We believe there is an imminent need for a blood-based testing solution that measures tumor-specific mutations and the patient’s immune profile to provide physicians with more comprehensive information to assess the overall prognosis of the patient and personalize treatment plans. We offer the blood-based Biodesix Lung Reflex testing strategy, which consists of the GeneStrat tumor profiling test and the VeriStrat immune profiling test for patients diagnosed with NSCLC. With a three-day turnaround time, we are able to quickly provide critical diagnostic information to physicians to facilitate personalized treatment decisions for their patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Monitoring: We believe longitudinally monitoring advanced NSCLC patients for the dynamic evolution of their tumor and immune profile while on treatment can provide an earlier indication of treatment resistance and/or disease progression. We offer the Biodesix Lung Reflex testing strategy as a blood-based monitoring tool for physicians to track their patients’ disease evolution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagnosis – Nodule Management
 We believe we are the only company to offer two commercial blood-based tests to help physicians reclassify risk of malignancy in patients with suspicious lung nodules. Our blood-based nodule management offering, Nodify Lung Nodule Risk Assessment assists physicians in reclassifying a patient’s risk of lung cancer by incorporating their protein biomarker results with radiographic imaging and clinical characteristics. Nodify Lung consists of the Nodify CDT and Nodify XL2 proteomic tests, which can be ordered separately or together from a single blood draw to help reclassify risk of cancer to aid physicians in stratifying patients into distinct nodule management pathways: intervention or surveillance.
 11


The Nodify CDT test is used to help identify lung nodules that are likely malignant and the Nodify XL2 test helps identify lung nodules that are likely benign. Nodify Lung is available for patients 40 years or older, with nodules between 8 and 30mm, and less than 65% pre-test risk of lung cancer. The testing strategy starts with the Nodify CDT test to determine if a nodule is likely malignant or at a higher risk of lung cancer. The Nodify CDT test helps physicians identify cancer more quickly by prioritizing patients with a higher risk of malignancy for a diagnostic procedure, such as biopsy or surgery. If the nodule is not identified as having a high risk of malignancy by Nodify CDT, then the Nodify XL2 test is performed to help determine if the patient’s nodule is likely benign or has a reduced risk of lung cancer and may be a candidate for CT imaging surveillance. The Nodify Lung testing strategy is represented graphically in the image below starting with the patient’s pre-test risk of malignancy and ending with the guideline-recommended diagnostic procedure for each risk category.
 

We believe we are the only company to offer two commercial blood-based tests to help physicians reclassify risk of malignancy in patients with suspicious lung nodules. We launched the Nodify Lung combined offering of Nodify CDT and Nodify XL2 in March 2020. However, the Nodify XL2 test has been available to all physicians since September 2019 and has been available to a select group of physicians since October 2018. We acquired the Nodify XL2 test from Integrated Diagnostics in July 2018, and acquired the Nodify CDT from Oncimmune USA in October 2019.
 Nodify CDT
 Nodify CDT is a blood-based proteomic test that helps identify patients who have a suspicious lung nodule that is likely malignant or at a higher risk of being cancerous. Results allow physicians to identify patients who may be better candidates for timely invasive diagnostic procedures such as bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle biopsy, or surgical resection, with the hope of catching cancer earlier. Nodify CDT enhances lung nodule risk assessment to facilitate compliance with clinical treatment guidelines such as those of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). Nodify CDT is intended for use in patients who are 40 years or older, have nodules between 8 and 30mm, and pre-test risk of lung cancer of less than 65%.
 The test measures the levels of seven circulating autoantibodies (P53, NY-ESO-1, CAGE, GBU4-5, SOX2, HuD, and MAGE A4) associated with lung cancer, combined by an algorithm to report out three potential results: High Level, Moderate Level, or No Significant Levels of Antibodies Detected (NSLAD). The seven autoantibodies have shown to be elevated for all types of lung cancer, and from the earliest stage of the disease.
 Unlike the tumor antigens themselves, the autoantibody levels can be measured accurately through a blood sample, based upon the signal amplification generated by the immune response to cancer. This mechanism of action likely reflects very early events in a tumor’s evolution; as the immune system initiates a response to the cancer, it can also trigger an expansion of self-reactive antibodies that can be measured in circulation.

In addition to the test result of High Level, Moderate Level, or NSLAD, each test report includes the patient’s pre-test risk of malignancy as calculated by the Solitary Pulmonary Nodule Risk Assessment calculator, and their post-test risk of cancer incorporating the result of the test. The Solitary Pulmonary Nodule Risk Assessment calculator was developed by Stephen Swensen, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic and is designed to provide a risk of malignancy for a patient with a newly discovered incidental nodule. The model incorporates six clinical and radiologic factors into the equation: age, nodule size, smoking status, nodule location, spiculation (nodule edge characteristic), and previous history of lung cancer. Incorporating the autoantibody levels with the risk model provides physicians with a more accurate assessment of risk. The test has been studied in 14 peer reviewed published studies and presentations.
 Nodify XL2
 Nodify XL2 is a blood-based proteomic test that helps identify patients who have a suspicious lung nodule that is likely benign or at a reduced risk of being cancerous. Results allow physicians to identify patients who may be better candidates for routine CT surveillance to monitor for growth or shrinkage of the nodule over time instead of an invasive diagnostic procedure. Nodify XL2 is used for patients who are 40 years or older, have nodules between 8 and 30mm, and have a pre-test risk of lung cancer of less than or equal to 50%.
 Nodify XL2 integrates peptides measured by LC-MS with clinical and radiological characteristics that are combined by an algorithm to report out three potential results: Likely Benign, Reduced Risk, or Indeterminate. Specifically, the Nodify XL2 test measures the relative abundance of two peptides (LG3BP and C163A) in circulation in the patient’s blood. The native proteins from which the peptides are derived, have been associated with an inflammatory response to cancer. The clinical factors are patient age and smoking status, and radiological factors are nodule size, location, and edge characteristics.
 In addition to the test result of Likely Benign, Reduced Risk, or Indeterminate, each test report includes the patient’s pre-test risk of lung cancer as calculated by the Solitary Pulmonary Nodule Risk Assessment calculator, and their post-Nodify XL2 risk of malignancy incorporating the result of the test. Incorporating the peptide levels with the risk model provides physicians with a revised assessment of risk incorporating the patient’s biology.
 In summary, the inclusion of the Nodify Lung testing strategy into clinical practice helps physicians reclassify risk of malignancy of low to moderate risk lung nodules by incorporating the patient’s own biology into the assessment. The Nodify CDT test helps physicians identify patients with a high-risk lung nodule who may benefit from timely intervention, which can ultimately help identify lung cancer earlier. The Nodify XL2 test helps physicians identify patients with a very low risk lung nodule who may benefit from CT surveillance and could avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.
 Blood samples for Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT can be collected in the physician’s office, laboratory, or at home through use of mobile phlebotomy. Mobile phlebotomy options facilitate testing for patients even if they are not seen in person by the physician and instead are seen through telehealth visits. This benefits the patient as scheduling can be conveniently fit to their needs and can keep them away from a physician’s office or hospital for safety concerns, especially with the evolving coronavirus pandemic. Additionally, mobile phlebotomy benefits the physician as the logistics around a blood draw or tissue sampling are out of their hands. We have a national network of contracted Nurses and Phlebotomists to support at-home or mobile blood collection.
 Both tests require a single blood sample shipped at ambient temperature to our certified, high-complexity clinical laboratory in De Soto, Kansas.  Nodify CDT requires whole blood and Nodify XL2 requires whole blood spotted onto our proprietary Blood Collection Device (BCD). The introduction of the BCD as a qualified specimen collection method for use with the Nodify XL2 test alleviated the need for serum separation processing steps by phlebotomists at blood draw sites such as centrifugation, and cold chain (dry ice) shipments, which has increased the market access to our proteomic-based tests. Results for Nodify CDT alone are typically available within one day. If both tests are ordered for the patient and Nodify CDT returns a result of NSLAD, then both test results are typically available within 4 to 5 days. All results are available through a portal, fax, hard copy, or mobile device.

Treatment Guidance and Monitoring
 Profiling the tumor through blood-based testing can help identify mutations in genes that may be driving growth of the tumor and may be targets for therapeutics. However, tumors also suppress intrinsic mechanisms that prevent the patient’s immune system from identifying and eliminating the cancer cells. Profiling the immune system can show if the patient’s immune system may have been subverted and therefore, is less likely to be responsive to immunotherapies. Our blood-based Biodesix Lung Reflex testing strategy consists of the GeneStrat tumor profiling test and the VeriStrat immune profiling test, which can be ordered together or separately for patients with NSCLC. Together, the tests typically have a 3-day turnaround time, providing physicians with timely results to facilitate treatment decisions.
 GeneStrat
 GeneStrat is a blood-based tumor profiling test that detects the guideline recommended, actionable mutations in lung cancer: EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, EML4-ALK, ROS-1, and RET. Physicians can order one or any combination of the gene tests, whichever they deem medically necessary for the individual patient. The presence of a mutation in one of the genes could indicate the patient is a candidate for the associated guideline-recommended targeted therapy. The GeneStrat test performance and potential clinical utility have been published in 3 peer reviewed studies.
 GeneStrat test results are typically available within 72 hours from our receipt of the sample in our Boulder, Colorado clinical laboratory. In a study at Eastern Carolina University, it was observed that blood-based testing was up to three weeks faster than tissue-based testing, with tissue-based testing taking a median of 26 days from sample collection. With GeneStrat testing, results are typically available in time for the patients first oncology visit, allowing the patient to start front-line treatment as quickly as possible. In the same study, it was observed that only 4% of patients had tissue-based molecular test results prior to start of front-line treatment. Meanwhile, after integrating Biodesix Lung Reflex testing at the institution, 72% of patients had molecular test results available. Testing with the GeneStrat test can help physicians identify driver mutations quickly to help speed up time to treatment.
 

We believe that rapid, blood-based tumor profiling with the GeneStrat test is complementary to both targeted tissue-based testing (including PD-L1) and broad genomic sequencing. Testing with GeneStrat at diagnosis can help quickly identify patients who are eligible for targeted therapies. Additionally, blood-based testing upfront can help save valuable tissue for diagnostic evaluation, PD-L1 testing and broad genomic profiling for rare mutations to enroll in clinical trials.
 14


VeriStrat
 VeriStrat is a blood-based proteomic test that provides a personalized view of each patient’s immune response to their lung cancer. Results help inform physicians whether their patient has a more aggressive cancer and can help with treatment planning. VeriStrat profiles the patient’s immune system by measuring eight protein features measured by mass spectrometry and interpreted by a proprietary machine learning-based algorithm to produce either a VeriStrat Good or VeriStrat Poor test result.
The presence of a VeriStrat Poor result indicates the presence of chronic inflammation and a chronic acute phase immune response. A chronic acute phase immune response can trigger the immune system to provide growth factors to the tumor to increase blood flow and tumor growth. The test has been studied in over 85 peer-reviewed and published clinical studies across many different types of therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immune therapies, and combinations. The results consistently show the test to be predictive of outcomes, independent of other prognostic factors including PD-L1 expression and performance status. Patients who test as VeriStrat Poor, on average, have an overall survival that is less than half of those who test as VeriStrat Good, independent of treatment type, demonstrating that the test is strongly prognostic. Conversely, patients with a VeriStrat Good test result typically respond better to standard of care treatments than those patients that test as VeriStrat Poor. By using the VeriStrat test for immune profiling, physicians can help identify the patients with an immune status associated with generally poor prognosis who should be treated with alternate therapies or in clinical trials.
 GeneStrat requires whole blood and VeriStrat requires a whole blood sample spotted onto our proprietary BCD. Both samples are shipped at ambient temperature and testing is performed in our certified, high-complexity clinical laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. GeneStrat is performed using the ddPCR technology, and the protein features in VeriStrat are measured using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. Results are typically available within 72 hours through a portal, fax, hard copy, or mobile device.
 COVID-19
 Biodesix WorkSafe COVID-19 Testing Program
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through our partnership with Bio-Rad, we commercialized the Biodesix WorkSafe testing program. Our scientific diagnostic expertise, technologies, and existing commercial infrastructure enabled us to rapidly commercialize two diagnostic tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The first test is the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test, which is a molecular test intended for detecting active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The test was FDA EUA authorized on May 1, 2020, authorizing performance of the test in laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high complexity tests. The second test is the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test, which is an antibody test intended for detecting a B-cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection. The test was FDA EUA authorized on April 29, 2020.
 Within a month of initiating our development collaboration with Bio-Rad, we were able to launch two tests for commercial use. We were able to bring these tests to market as fast as possible due to our scientific diagnostic expertise, technologies and existing commercial infrastructure. In addition to our launch agility, we have been able to rapidly scale our laboratory operations for high-volume testing. We remain committed to delivering rapid test results in 24 to 48 hours on average.
 Using the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab tests, we operate and have commercialized the Biodesix WorkSafe testing program.
 Prior to using the Bio-Rad tests as part of our testing program, we performed feasibility, verification, and validation studies, including developing software for process automation, sample accessioning, data management and reporting, all required to demonstrate the test operated as claimed by the manufacturer and as required by our certifying regulatory agencies for high complexity laboratory testing. We secured independent reference specimens run with EUA tests to validate these tests as fit for diagnostic use in our laboratories. Post-launch development support for these tests have included improvements in on-boarding new personnel, logistics of sample collection, sample receipt and data reporting, all required to support our testing program. Additional releases of the laboratory data management software are ongoing and planned for the foreseeable future.

Our tests are utilized by healthcare providers, including hospitals and nursing homes and are also offered to businesses and educational systems to assist in their back-to-work or back to school strategies. Recently, we announced multiple partnerships for COVID-19 testing, and Colorado Governor Jared Polis announced at a press conference on July 23, 2020 that we will now be supporting wide-spread COVID-19 testing for the State of Colorado. Additionally, we announced a partnership as the official COVID-19 testing partner for the Major League Lacrosse as they competed in their 2020 tournament. We also announced on September 30, 2020 that we will oversee and manage onsite testing and testing validation for the Big Ten Conference athletic competitions.
 Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test
 
The Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test, also known as a molecular or viral test, is intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The test targets detection of the nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 (not from any other viruses or pathogens) in respiratory specimens to identify and isolate infected individuals. Recent studies have shown that ddPCR-based testing is more sensitive than qPCR for detecting SARS-CoV-2, specifically in the reduction of false negative results. In one study, the ddPCR test demonstrated 95% accuracy vs. 47% for other “bulk” RT-PCR technologies used in other molecular tests Specimens are shipped at ambient temperature or dry ice depending on the viral transport media (VTM) used, and testing is performed using ddPCR in our certified, high-complexity clinical laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. Results are typically available through fax, hard copy, or encrypted email within 24 to 48 hours on average from receipt of the sample.
 Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab Test
 The Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test (also known as a serology or antibody test) is intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals who have developed an adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, indicating recent or prior infection. The test uses whole blood to detect circulating antibodies against the virus. The sensitivity is 98% and specificity is 99% eight days after the onset of symptoms. At this time, it is not known how long antibodies persist following infection and if the presence of antibodies confers protective immunity. The test is intended for the qualitative detection of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA) in human serum or plasma specimens. The test requires a 3 mL blood draw, and samples are shipped at ambient temperature. Testing is conducted using semi-automated ELISA technology in our certified, high-complexity clinical laboratory in De Soto, Kansas. Results are typically available within 24 to 48 hours from receipt of the sample through fax, hard copy, or encrypted email.
 Biopharmaceutical Diagnostic Discovery, Development and Testing Services Business
 We believe our leadership in clinical proteomics and our technology agnostic approach to probe the cancer disease state provides our customers with a clear and distinct advantage over other diagnostic service providers who solely focus on either genomics or proteomics. Similar to our commercial clinical testing business, our biopharmaceutical diagnostic discovery, development and testing services business leverages the Diagnostic Cortex to provide an extensively validated and deep learning approach to discovering new biomarkers, which in turn helps drive the clinical development of therapeutics. We recognize each clinical development program is complex, which is why we offer end-to-end diagnostic solutions, ranging from initial biomarker discovery and feasibility projects to commercialization of companion diagnostics.
 To address the increasing complexity of disease biology and new drug mechanisms of action, we employ a technology agnostic approach to uncover insights about the tumor biology and patient’s immune response to cancer for therapeutics in clinical development. With our broad technology and service offering, including the performance of over 30 assays for research use as part of our laboratory services (see diagram below), we are able to provide the depth and breadth of biomarker tools for our partners for multi-omic analyses across their product development efforts. Although we recognize the importance of a multi-omic, technology agnostic approach in translational research, we are experts in discovering and developing proteomic-based diagnostic tests to help interrogate the immune profile and host disease state of patients on particular therapeutics. Traditionally, oncology biomarkers have been discovered from tumor tissue, but with the increased trend in the number of programs featuring immuno-oncology agents in therapeutic development, we believe there is a clinical unmet need for blood-based tumor markers and host/immune biomarkers to complement information obtained from tissue.
 16



We believe we provide benefit to our biopharmaceutical customers as they integrate strategies for increasing the probability of success for pivotal clinical trials. Specifically, our diagnostic testing services may help enable quicker enrollment rates for patients in prospective clinical trials, ranging from phase 1 to phase 3, and could help identify patient populations who may experience the greatest benefit from new therapeutics. Ultimately, our goal is to help biopharmaceutical customers realize greater efficiency in their clinical development programs. Additionally, we have the ability to access and leverage our large sample and data biobank for our partners’ data mining needs, including new test discovery.
 While our biopharmaceutical discovery, diagnostic development and testing revenue continues to grow, it is important to note that we benefit greatly from these partnerships in many ways that expand beyond revenue. We are continuously expanding our knowledge and biological understanding of multiple diseases and the rapidly evolving treatment landscape, while our Diagnostic Cortex continues to be powered through these biomarker analyses. Additionally, our sample and data biobank continue to grow and can be further leveraged for internal test development and external partnering. Importantly, we look to supplement our product development efforts with companion diagnostics as they are developed.
 To date, we have over 50 biopharmaceutical customers and academic partners who have utilized our diagnostic tests and services. The following are a few case studies of early-stage biomarker discovery and development with our biopharmaceutical customers.
  
• | AstraZeneca: We provided services to AstraZeneca to retrospectively analyze samples from the FLAURA clinical trial (NCT02296125). The goal of this analysis was to interpret and establish the clinical utility of blood-based longitudinal monitoring of EGFR sensitizing and resistance mutations by ddPCR in advanced NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib. The data demonstrated that these circulating DNA mutations could be tracked in blood to interpret the patient’s prognosis, and could help AstraZeneca to identify disease progression 3 months (median) in advance of standard imaging.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Genentech: We partnered with Genentech to discover a novel proteomic classifier for advanced NSCLC patients treated with atezolizumab. The test was discovered on a small clinical cohort (n=77) and was independently validated on blinded samples (n=270) from the POPLAR clinical trial (NCT01903993). The validation revealed that the proteomic test was predictive of progression free survival and overall survival for atezolizumab versus the control arm docetaxel. Additionally, an analysis compared the correlation between our proteomic classifier with standard of care biomarkers (PD-L1 expression status and tumor mutation burden), which revealed there was no significant correlation. This implies that our classifier provides unique and valuable information in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. It is our belief that Genentech could use this strategy to identify patients that could derive a longer progression free survival from atezolizumab.

Our Diagnostic Tests in Development
 With the goal of finding solutions for clinical unmet needs related to diagnosis, treatment and monitoring in lung disease, our diagnostic tests in development include the following:
 Early-Stage NSCLC—Risk of Recurrence
 Currently, surgical resection of the tumor without systemic or radiation therapy is standard of care for stage I NSCLC patients. However, 20 to 40% of surgically treated patients will suffer a recurrence within 5 years after surgery. From market research with pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, and medical oncologists, we identified a significant clinical unmet need for a blood-based test to help identify stage I NSCLC patients who are at a higher risk of recurrence and may benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic treatment. With this information, we discovered the Risk of Recurrence (ROR) test, which is a pre-surgery blood-based proteomic test, designed with the Diagnostic Cortex to predict whether a stage I NSCLC patient has a higher risk of recurrence post-surgical resection. Knowing this information early and before surgery may support treatment decisions such as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, which have the potential to reduce tumor volume and address micro-metastatic disease as early as possible. Our ROR test validated in an independent sample set, and we are currently working with major academic institutions across the United States to further validate the test.
 Late-Stage NSCLC—Immunotherapy Treatment Guidance
 In 2015, the first immunotherapy-based treatment regimen was approved by the FDA for use in lung cancer. Currently, there are 9 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) regimens (single agent or combinations) recommended by the NCCN guidelines for treatment of advanced NSCLC patients. For a portion of patients treated, these drugs can result in significant improvement in overall survival compared with platinum-based chemotherapy options.
 The combination ICI regimens see some improvement in performance over single agent ICI, but side effect profiles are worse, and costs are higher than for single agent ICI. In addition, recent data have shown that a subset of patients experience more rapid disease progression on ICI compared with chemotherapy. We utilized the Diagnostic Cortex platform to discover our Primary Immune Response (PIR) test. PIR is a blood-based proteomic test designed to profile a patient’s immune response to their cancer and stratify by who is likely to respond to ICI treatment. Our PIR test has been validated in multiple independent sample sets for advanced stage NSCLC patients treated with single agent ICI, and we are currently working with major academic institutions across the United States to further validate the test in a prospective study called BEACON-Lung.
 20


Monitoring – Progression & Resistance
 Blood-based monitoring with our ddPCR technology may offer a feasible method to non-invasively evaluate therapeutic mechanism of action, disease progression, and the emergence of resistance mutations in patients treated with targeted therapies. Our internal validation studies have shown the utility of the GeneStrat EGFR ddPCR test in all three of these indications. The test can identify disease progression up to 3 months (median) in advance of standard imaging. Using ddPCR for longitudinal blood-based monitoring of EGFR cell-free DNA mutations is a cost-effective testing method while patients are being treated with targeted therapies.
 COVID-19 Viral Infection – Risk of Severe Outcomes
 Despite significant medical advances in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, the virus continues to place health systems under pressure, with COVID-19 hospitalization rates in the United States exceeding 417 hospitalizations per 100,000 population the week ending January 31, 2021. Better understanding of how to identify which patients are at greatest risk of developing severe lung disease, requiring intubation, or dying from COVID-19 would help inform physicians of the risks and benefits of treatments, target higher risk patients for clinical trials, compare outcomes between patients with similar risk, and prioritize resources in a time of shortage. In partnership with an academic institution, we have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm for clinical decision support to help stratify patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are likely to require intervention, such as treatment with ventilators, admission to intensive care units, or those patients who may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), versus those who will likely not require intervention. Our COVID-19 AI-based algorithm validated in a blinded, independent study, and uses 26 easily obtainable variables from the emergency department at time of initial evaluation to classify patients, including patient characteristics, vital signs, and readily available laboratory test values. We are working with a United States and International COVID-19 consortia consisting of major academic institutions to perform additional large, blinded, independent validation testing of the classifier and we are currently exploring options for making the algorithm widely available to hospitals for future patient use.
Clinical Trials
 We are dedicated to continuously publishing and presenting new data on the clinical validation and utility of our diagnostic tests. We have participated in 27 clinical studies, 5 of which are ongoing, and have published over 275 peer-reviewed publications and presentations. The following are our ongoing clinical studies for our diagnostic testing solutions.
 ORACLE Registry Study (NCT03766958)
 The ORACLE registry study was designed to develop real-world clinical utility data for Nodify XL2 and is titled “An Observational Registry Study to Evaluate the Performance of the Nodify XL2 Test”. The study objectives are to show a reduction in invasive procedures on patients with benign nodules compared to a historical control obtained from chart review. The first patient enrolled on October 16, 2018. As of May 1, 2020, 423 patients have been enrolled and are undergoing primary endpoint analysis, with 2-year follow-up estimated to be completed by the first half of 2022.
 ALTITUDE Clinical Utility Study (NCT04171492)
 The ALTITUDE clinical utility study is designed to evaluate the performance of Nodify Lung (Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT) in a randomized controlled study (RCT). The study is titled “A Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial, Prospectively Evaluating the Clinical Utility of the Nodify XL2 Proteomic Test in Incidentally Discovered Low to Moderate Risk Lung Nodules”. We received central investigational review board (IRB) approval in December 2019 and have an enrollment goal of 2,000 patients. The study objectives are to evaluate how the addition of the Nodify Lung test result impacts the clinical decision making for patients with new, incidentally identified solid lung nodules assessed as low to moderate risk of lung cancer. The trial has an adaptive study design with a blinded standard of care arm and 2:1 randomization for open-label results for Nodify XL2. The study launched in December of 2020. Phase 1 of the study with only Nodify XL2 is expected to enroll 500 patients. Phase 2 of the adaptive study design will include an open-label arm for Nodify CDT, which is aligned with our commercial testing algorithm.

INSIGHT Observational Study (NCT03289780)
 The INSIGHT observational study is designed to evaluate the real-world clinical utility and performance of the Biodesix Lung Reflex (GeneStrat and VeriStrat) testing strategy. The title is “Observational Study Assessing the Clinical Effectiveness of VeriStrat and Validating Immunotherapy Tests in Subjects with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (INSIGHT)” and the first patient enrolled was on May 11, 2016. To date, we have over 3,500 patients enrolled with a target 5,000 enrollment goal. Final analysis with 3-year follow-up is estimated to be completed by 2024. Results of an interim analysis were presented at ASCO 2020. The study rationale is to guide the adoption of VeriStrat and inform medical decision making, including treatment choice, and enable the validation of additional mass spectrometry-based proteomic tests. The primary study objective is to describe the impact of the VeriStrat test results on treatment decisions, including but not limited to the percentage change in treatment decision, differences in chosen treatments between patients classified as VeriStrat Good and those classified as VeriStrat Poor, and the percentage of patients receiving systemic therapy or supportive therapies only.
 BEACON-Lung Clinical Study (Trial in Progress)
 In partnership with ALCMI (Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute), the BEACON-Lung clinical study is intended to evaluate the performance and utility of our proteomic product currently in development, PIR, in advanced stage NSCLC patients who express high PD-L1. The study title is “A Biomarker Analysis in High PD-L1 Expressing NSCLC Patients Treated With An Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) With or Without Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.” The study design is an observational, multicenter, open-label study to assess biomarkers (serum, microbiome, radiomics and tissue) as predictive of early progression in 390 treatment-naive patients with advanced stage NSCLC and PD-L1 greater than or equal to 50% treated with two standard of care regimens, triplet therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy plus ICI regimen) and ICI monotherapy (single agent ICI). The objectives are to collect biospecimens and evaluate candidate biomarkers, with a focus on PIR, to detect early progression on ICI monotherapy versus triplet therapy.
 DROPLET (Pending IRB Submission)
 Droplet is an exploratory direct to patient study to assess the utility a novel gene linkage phenomenon as measured by the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test, on the correlative immune response in individuals previously infected with the COVID-19 virus.  The primary objective of this study (titled “ddPCR Linkage, Viral Load and Immune Response in Individuals Infected with COVID-19”) is to evaluate the correlation between linkage, viral load and the immune responses in individuals who have had a natural infection with SARS-CoV-2.  Fifty patients will be enrolled and serially tested for viral load and immune responses for up to 12 months.
 Commercialization
 For our lung cancer and nodule management tests, commercial efforts are focused on the promotion of our testing strategies to healthcare professionals actively involved in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Primarily focusing on pulmonology, the commercial team, consisting of specialty sales representatives, medical affairs, marketing and customer care representatives, works to educate and inform the entire patient care group consisting of physicians, nurses, office staff, laboratory personnel, and administration as to the appropriate use and value provided by our testing. The team’s goal is to drive test adoption through articulating the scientific and clinical evidence behind our tests, how they impact the clinical care of a patient, and how the tests can ultimately help to improve patient outcomes.
 Patients with pulmonary nodules are concentrated in this sub-specialty, where additional resources such as lung cancer screening and nodule management clinics may exist to provide an increased level of care. We are also engaging large hospital systems in a “top-down” approach, with a goal of incorporating our tests into system wide pathways and protocols.
 After a physician orders our tests, blood is collected either in the physician office or laboratory, third-party “store front” patient service centers, or it can be collected in the patient’s home or workplace. We have contracted with a network of patient service centers and mobile phlebotomy services to be enable collection of blood samples outside of the physician office, at home or work for patients across the United States.
 22


For our Biodesix WorkSafe COVID-19 testing program, we have a dedicated outreach team that works with the State of Colorado healthcare providers and hospitals, and employers looking to safely return to work across many industries, including food services, oil and gas, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, sports teams, universities, and many small businesses. We recognize everyone’s COVID-19 situation is unique, which is why we provide end-to-end customized solutions to support testing for our different customers, such as risk assessment tools, physician ordering services, on-site testing, phlebotomy services, shipping logistics, and ongoing client support.
 Our business development team is focused on selling our complete offering of tests and services to biopharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. Our team consists of customer facing business development associates that work with our biopharmaceutical customers to identify projects, draw up statements of work and negotiate service agreements. Alliance managers help to manage the contractual obligations and scope of the project, whereas our operations team assures the project is managed with adequate resources and delivers on time. We take a two-pronged approach generating business in this segment. Primarily, we leverage existing projects and relationships to expand sales in current accounts. We also actively map ongoing drug development projects in biopharmaceutical companies and target programs best suited to our platform for new test development.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 The primary source of reimbursement for our tests in the United States is from third-party payers including government payers, such as Medicare, and commercial payers, such as insurance companies. For our COVID-19 testing program, the primary source of reimbursement is through contracts with hospitals, companies providing wellness testing for their employees, or direct pay from patients. We believe that our lung cancer tests can both improve patient outcomes and help guide cost-effective treatment choices for patients with and at-risk of lung cancer. Achieving broad coverage and adequate reimbursement for each of our tests is a key component of our financial success and will continue to be important over time.
 Under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), Congress has imposed a broad requirement that Medicare fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and commercial payers generally cover clinical diagnostic laboratory tests administered during the Public Health Emergency for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 or the diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19. Where applicable, the FFCRA and CARES require payers to cover COVID-19 tests without cost sharing or medical management techniques like prior authorization. Medicare fee-for-service does not require cost sharing or prior authorization for any clinical diagnostic laboratory tests.
 The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) has indicated in guidance that the coverage requirements of the FFCRA and CARES can apply both to infection and serological testing, but that they are only applicable to testing that is “diagnostic,” which “may include testing of individuals with signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19, as well as asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2.” Testing that is “not primarily intended for individualized diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 or another health condition,” including “testing conducted to screen for general workplace health and safety,” is beyond the scope of the statutory coverage requirements. We believe these coverage requirements apply to the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test when performed for diagnostic purposes. In some cases, we submit claims to insurance payers for the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test and/or the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test. In these cases, insurance payers may have a different position on the scope of mandatory coverage of our tests under the FFCRA and CARES. More commonly, we enter into  arrangements with clients under which the client pays us directly for testing.
 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds complexity to the billing process. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for overseeing the establishment of new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for billing the Medicare program and other payers. CMS continuously evaluates and implements changes to the Medicare billing, coding, and reimbursement processes. To receive reimbursement from third-party payers, we bill our tests using a variety of HCPCS codes or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, as defined by the American Medical Association. For some of the tests we conduct, there may not be a specific CPT or HCPCS code, in which case the test may be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure or unlisted multiple analyte test with algorithmic analysis (MAAA) procedure. Because these miscellaneous codes do not describe a specific service, the third-party payer claim may be examined to determine the service provided, whether the service was appropriate and medically necessary and whether payment should be rendered. This process can result in a delay in processing the claim, a lower reimbursement amount, and/or denial of the claim.

Competitors
 We primarily face competition from lung cancer diagnostic solutions companies in the United States, Europe and Asia seeking to answer clinical questions in the space, all of whom provide cancer-focused diagnostic tests to hospitals, researchers, clinicians, laboratories and other medical facilities.
 Diagnosis—Nodule Management
 We are not aware of any other company that offers two commercial blood-based tests to help physicians reclassify risk of malignancy in patients with suspicious lung nodules. We are aware of efforts by Veracyte, Inc. to develop and validate a test that may be competitive to the Nodify XL2 and/or Nodify CDT tests in the future. Additionally, Veracyte currently markets a test that is used post-bronchoscopy that is not competitive with our pre-bronchoscopy nodule risk assessment tests.
 Prognosis, Treatment Guidance and Monitoring—NSCLC
 We are unaware of any other diagnostic test available, commercially or in development, that will compete with our VeriStrat immune profiling test. There is substantial interest and activity in tumor profiling through liquid biopsy. Our genomic test offering, GeneStrat, faces competition from academic hospital laboratories, and companies such as Guardant Health and Foundation Medicine. We believe that there are several companies and academic research institutions in the process of developing tests for monitoring patients on or following treatment for recurrence or progression of lung cancer.
 COVID-19 Testing
 We believe that our competitors include university and state laboratories, national reference laboratories such as Lab Corporation and Quest Diagnostics, in-hospital laboratories, and a number of other diagnostic providers. We are aware that a number of other companies have announced development efforts to develop COVID-19 tests.
 Biopharmaceutical Diagnostic Discovery, Development & Testing Services
 We are aware of a number of companies who compete with our diagnostic tests and services, including diagnostic research, clinical trial testing, and the discovery, development, and commercialization of companion diagnostics. From the perspective of tumor profiling, we believe Guardant Health and Foundation Medicine are our most significant competitors. Conversely, in the immune profiling market, we believe Adaptive Biotechnologies and Personalis are our most significant competitors.
 Clinical Laboratory Operations
 We perform the VeriStrat, GeneStrat, and COVID-19 ddPCR tests in our Boulder, Colorado clinical laboratory. The laboratory is CAP-accredited, CLIA-certified, New York Department of Health (NYSDOH)— permitted and licensed, ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management Systems—Requirements for Regulatory Purposes for Medical Devices certified, along with all other states that require licensing: California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. All aspects of the testing process from receipt of the test requisition form through to delivery of test results are performed in the Boulder, Colorado facility. The proprietary testing methods use semi-automated workflows that facilitate the successful delivery of greater than 90% of our tests within 3 days, and we  believe our existing workflows will continue to successfully deliver our tests within this timeframe.
 The Nodify XL2, Nodify CDT, and COVID-19 total antibody tests are performed in our De Soto, Kansas clinical laboratory. This clinical laboratory is CLIA-certified, COLA-accredited, New York Department of Health—permitted and licensed, and licensed by California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island. Efforts are underway with the NYSDOH to become permitted and licensed to perform Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT testing for samples from the state of New York. Receipt of requisitions and testing is performed in our De Soto, Kansas clinical laboratory. Delivery of the test results is performed by personnel from our Boulder, Colorado headquarters. The proprietary testing methods use semi-automated workflows that facilitate the successful delivery of greater than 90% of our tests within 5 days, and we believe our existing workflows will continue to successfully deliver our tests within this timeframe.
 Personnel in both facilities are responsible for quality assurance oversight, licensing, and regulation compliance and maintenance to ensure data integrity and consistent, validated processes.
 24


Supply Chain
 We rely on third-party suppliers, including in some instances single source suppliers, to provide us with certain components of our diagnostic tests. The number of suppliers feeding into the production of our diagnostic tests is in excess of 65 worldwide. We consider a select few of these suppliers, located in the United States, Europe and China, as critical single source providers of components. Bio-Rad, as described below, is the sole source supplier for our GeneStrat test and COVID-19 and antibody testing program. Oncimmune is also the sole source supplier for our Nodify CDT tests but there are known secondary suppliers for these materials. We have initiated the second source qualification process for the majority of these critical components.
 In addition, we purchase supplies through purchase orders without long-term supply agreements with, or guaranteed commitments from, many of our suppliers, including single source suppliers. Additionally, at present, we rely on contract manufacturers for the production of our diagnostic tests. We depend on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements.
 We entered into a nonexclusive license and supply agreement with Bio-Rad in August 2019. We rely on Bio-Rad to supply equipment and reagents used to perform ddPCR testing, a service offered by us under a variety of fee for service agreements and the core technology powering the GeneStrat test, but these supplies are able to be supplied by known suppliers. A disruption to this supply would negatively impact our ability to perform the GeneStrat and SARS-CoV-2 tests until alternatives could be validated.
 While we have initiated the second source qualification process for the majority of these critical components, we may not be successful in securing second sourcing for all of them at all or on a timely basis. A disruption to this supply would negatively impact our ability to perform these tests until an alternative supplier could be validated.
 All materials for our VeriStrat test and Nodify XL2 tests have alternative suppliers readily available, and a disruption in any single supplier would not materially impact our ability to deliver the test.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed us to pressure-test our supply chain and logistics processes as we purchased additional manufacturing capacity above our normal run rates to ensure that supply to execute on tests for the foreseeable future was available in-stock and in-house. Our suppliers have been able to allocate sufficient capacity to meet this increased demand with reasonable lead times and therefore we believe sufficient capacity exists for all tests for the next 24 months.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property and proprietary protection for our products and other know-how, to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, and to defend and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We take efforts to protect our proprietary position using a variety of methods, which include pursuit of United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we determine are important to our business. We also may rely on trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing and acquisition opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. For more information regarding risks relating to intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We have invested heavily in the protection of our key assets, namely the VeriStrat® and GeneStrat® tests, and we acquired a patent portfolio relating to the Nodify XL2® and Nodify CDT™ tests in our acquisitions of Integrated Diagnostics in June 2018, and of Oncimmune USA in October 2019 from Oncimmune Limited (Oncimmune). We own patents and patent applications as well as trade secrets relating to our products currently in development, collection device for whole blood, business strategy, client lists and business methods. Further, we have expanded our access to key intellectual property through license and co-development agreements, including our Non-Exclusive License Agreement with Bio-Rad (the Bio-Rad License), which allows us to use the Droplet Digital PCR™ technology developed by Bio-Rad and which we employ in our GeneStrat test.
 25


Our patent strategy has focused on creating and acquiring protection for our VeriStrat and Nodify XL2 proteomic tests, while utilizing trade secret and some methods patent protection for our genomic test (the GeneStrat test) and ELISA test (the Nodify CDT test). We have entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with Bio-Rad, without the right to grant sublicenses, to utilize certain of Bio-Rad’s intellectual property, machinery, materials, reagents, supplies and know-how necessary for the performance of ddPCR in cancer detection testing for third parties in the United States. For more information regarding this license and supply agreement, please see “—Material Agreements—Agreements with Bio-Rad.” Bio-Rad owns patents relating to ddPCR and to which we have a non-exclusive license to utilize for the performance of ddPCR in cancer detection testing for third parties as set forth in the Bio- Rad License Agreement. In addition, we have separately been granted permission by Bio-Rad to use the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test and Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test for commercial diagnostic services. For more information regarding the permission granted to us by Bio-Rad with respect to such tests, please see “Business—Material Agreements—Agreements with Bio-Rad.” We are unaware of patents owned by Bio-Rad relating to its COVID- 19 antibody test but acknowledge that Bio-Rad has know-how and trade secrets relating to this test. We have patent protection in the United States and other countries around the world for the primary use of the VeriStrat test for profiling of patients with NSCLC, and various other uses of the VeriStrat test, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer have received patent protection. We have also received patent protection relating to our core classifier development program, our Diagnostic Cortex® technologies and our approaches to using mass shot matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight  (MALDI-ToF) technology (DeepMALDI® techniques). Additionally, our first device patent was issued in 2019 for our internally designed blood collection device.
 As of October 21, 2020, our patent portfolio includes approximately 49 issued United States patents, 38 issued foreign patents, which includes 3 European patents that were nationalized in multiple European countries, and 40 pending applications (including 23 foreign patent applications). With regard to our product development efforts, provisional applications have been filed around new developments relating to ARDS and COVID diagnostics, and national stage applications are now in active prosecution to protect our ROR and PIR tests.
 The patent portfolio can be broken down into 5 categories:
  
1) | Issued patents and patent applications relating to the VeriStrat and Nodify tests and uses of these tests;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Issued patents and patent applications relating to methods for developing classifiers using the Diagnostic Cortex and DeepMALDI technologies;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Issued patents and patent applications relating to tests currently in development;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Issued patents and patent applications relating to our novel blood collection device; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | Issued patents and patent applications relating to tests developed for our third-party partners.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The patents relating to the VeriStrat test are scheduled to expire between 2026 and 2032. The patents relating to the Nodify XL2 test are scheduled to expire beginning in 2031 (excluding any patent term extension granted by the USPTO), and the patents relating to the Nodify CDT test are scheduled to expire in 2027. The patent related to the blood collection device is scheduled to expire in 2039. Should our current patent applications in prosecution in the United States issue, the resulting patents would be scheduled to have expiration dates between 2036 and 2040 (excluding any patent term extension(s) granted by the USPTO).
 While we do not currently have any pending PCT applications, we often convert provisional patent applications to PCT applications. PCT patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file such PCT applications as national stage patent application(s) within 30 months in the countries in which we seek patent protection. If we do not timely file any national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to any such PCT patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in such PCT patent applications. Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents but can become the basis of PCT foreign stage and United States non-provisional patent applications, if such applications are filed within 12 months of filing the related provisional patent application. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we will lose our priority date and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in any such provisional patent application.
 26


In addition, the term of individual issued patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we have filed, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application, assuming the patent has not been terminally disclaimed over a commonly-owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor, or over a patent not commonly owned but that was disqualified as prior art as the result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. The life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is therefore limited and once the patent lives of our issued patents have expired, we may face competition, including from other competing technologies. In the United States, the term of a patent may also be eligible for patent term adjustment for delays within the USPTO. The term of a patent that covers a biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted for a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, subject to certain limitations and provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. Any such patent term extension can be for no more than five years, only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval, and only those claims covering the approved biological product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.
 Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and maintaining and enforcing claims that are granted. However, our owned and licensed patents could be invalidated or narrowed or otherwise fail to adequately protect our proprietary and intellectual property position and our pending owned and licensed patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents.
 Because branding is as much a part of any intellectual property strategy as patent or trade secret protection we have a number of registered and pending trademarks relating to our company and products. We have received or filed for trademark protection in the United States for our tradename (Biodesix), the names of four of our commercial tests (namely the VeriStrat, GeneStrat, Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT tests), and a suite of research tests (ImmunoStrat), as well as having trademark protection for our core development and methodological platforms, such as our Diagnostic Cortex and DeepMALDI technologies. In all, as of September 21, 2020, we have 22 uniquely registered United States trademarks 10 of which (including Biodesix, VeriStrat, and GeneStrat) have received foreign issuances as well. We will continue to pursue protection in the United States and abroad for our branded assets and will continue to use branding to protect products currently in development, key Biodesix developments and non-trade secret methodologies.
 We also rely on trade secrets, including know how, confidential information, unpatented technologies and other proprietary information, to strengthen or enhance our competitive position, protect and maintain aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not presently consider appropriate for, patent protection, and prevent competitors from reverse engineering or copying our technologies. We have decided that some technologies, such as our laboratory methodologies (including sample preparation and assay development), and some information (such as client and billing information) are best kept as trade secrets. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. To avoid inadvertent and improper disclosure of trade secrets, and to avoid the risks of former employees using these trade secrets to future employment, it is our policy to require employees, consultants and independent contractors to assign all rights to intellectual property they develop in connection with their employment with or services for the Company to the Company. We also protect our existing and developing intellectual property expressly through confidentiality provisions in agreements with third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information, or adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information.
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our trade secrets and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
 27


We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives, which may include objectives within and outside the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, and despite the breadth of protection that has issued around our key assets, these rights may not be respected in the future or may be circumvented or challenged (and potentially invalidated) in a legal proceeding in any jurisdiction where we have intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where we have received intellectual property protection and where we may eventually distribute our products may not afford the same protections or assurances to the same extent as the laws in the United States. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
 Government Regulations
 Clinical laboratory tests like our diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA and State law. The FDA regulates medical devices pursuant to the FDCA, including many diagnostic test kits, such as IVDs. However, most LDTs are not currently subject to the FDA’s regulation (although reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to such regulation) because the FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion over LDTs. LDTs are a subset of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests that are intended for clinical use and developed, validated, and offered within a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory. FDA’s authority to regulate LDTs has been contested for many years, and there have been several legislative and administrative proposals regarding LDT regulation seeking to end or limit enforcement discretion and to bring LDTs under new or existing FDA regulatory frameworks:
  
• | On July 9, 2012, Congress passed legislation in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA) requiring the agency to notify the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce of its intent to regulate LDTs. This law, though enacted, had a 5-year sunset provision, meaning that FDA is no longer subject to this notification requirement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests, which provided an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests, which provided guidance on how the FDA intended to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. In the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, the FDA asserted that LDT manufacturers would be subject to medical device premarket submission, registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements phased in over several years based on which tests posed the highest risk to public health.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On November 18, 2016, however, the FDA announced that it would not release the final guidance and would instead continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration, and Congress to determine the right approach.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper on possible approaches to regulate LDTs in which it described a policy wherein previously marketed LDTs would not be expected to comply with most or all FDA oversight requirements, except for adverse event and malfunction reporting. In addition, certain new and significantly modified LDTs would not be expected to comply with pre-market review unless the agency determines certain tests could lead to patient harm.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In March 2017, the draft Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act (DAIA) was introduced and outlined a risk-based regulatory approach for in vitro clinical tests (IVCT), i.e., all IVDs regardless of whether they are commercially distributed diagnostic kits or LDTs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In April 2017, the FDA issued a document describing case studies of LDTs that raised concerns about the safety and efficacy of this category of tests. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In August 2018, the FDA responded to the DAIA draft with its own proposal for IVCTs, including PMA, provisional approval, and precertification, in addition to authority to revoke approval, request raw data, and take corrective action against test developers to protect public health.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28


 
• | On October 31, 2018, the FDA issued its Safety Communication entitled “The FDA Warns Against the Use of Many Genetic Tests with Unapproved Claims to Predict Patient Response to Specific Medications” alleging that the agency was “aware” of healthcare providers making “inappropriate changes to a patient’s antidepressant medication based on the results from genetic tests.” Following this Safety Alert, the FDA contacted several laboratories that offered tests that made claims regarding drug responses for specific medications. While most laboratories addressed the FDA’s concerns by removing specific medication names from their labeling, the FDA issued an enforcement letter against a laboratory for making such claims without first undergoing the FDA premarket review.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In December 2018, a new draft bill which revised the DAIA and incorporated feedback from the FDA was released. The Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge, IVCT Development (VALID) Act creates a risk-based regulatory framework for IVCT regulation. Under the VALID Act framework, premarket review would be required for certain higher risk tests, while lower risk tests would be subject to a precertification pathway.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On April 4, 2019, the FDA issued a warning letter to Inova Genomics Laboratory for its pharmacogenomics tests, i.e., tests that predict medication response, among other things. In this letter, the FDA rebutted Inova’s argument that it believed it was operating within the scope of FDA’s LDT exemption and not subject to the FDA’s premarket review or labeling requirements by noting that the FDA has not created a legal “carve-out” or exemption for LDTs and that it ultimately retains discretion to take action when appropriate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On March 5, 2020, identical versions of the VALID Act were introduced in both chambers of Congress. The same day, the House bill was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On August 19, 2020, HHS announced a new policy determining that FDA must engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking before requiring premarket review of LDTs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On Nov. 16, 2020, HHS directed FDA to review voluntarily submitted EUAs for LDTs; if FDA’s review time exceeds 14 days, the submission would be referred to the National Institute of Health National Cancer Institute and also to other scientific government agencies, or to outside technical contractors if FDA remains unable to conduct the reviews.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We currently market our GeneStrat, VeriStrat, Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT tests as LDTs in the United States. As a result, we believe our diagnostic services are not currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable FDCA provisions. If the FDA disagrees with the LDT status of any of our tests, the FDA may consider the test to be an unapproved medical device and may subject us to FDA enforcement action, including, without limitation, requiring us to seek clearance, authorization or approval for the laboratory test. If the FDA were to begin enforcement with respect to our LDTs, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain pre-market clearance or approval and costs associated with complying with post-market requirements.
 To date, the FDA has not engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking or released broad-sweeping guidance, but it could choose to do so in the future and if pre-market review is required, our business could be negatively impacted as a result of commercial delay that may be caused by the new requirements. The cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support pre-market applications may be significant. If we are required to submit applications for our currently marketed tests, we may be required to conduct additional studies, which may be time-consuming, costly and could result in our currently-marketed tests being withdrawn from the market. Continued compliance with the FDA’s regulations would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to heightened regulation by the FDA including penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in an enforcement action by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. There are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. Until the FDA finalizes its regulatory position regarding LDTs, or the VALID Act or other legislation is passed reforming the federal government’s regulation of LDTs, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate our tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support any required clearance or approval. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time and we are monitoring developments and anticipate that our products will be able to comply with requirements that may be imposed by the FDA. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA accreditation, which permits the use of LDTs for diagnostics purposes.

FDA Emergency Use Authorization
 Section 564 of the FDCA allows the FDA to authorize the shipment of drugs, biological products, or medical devices that either lack required approval, licensure, or clearance (unapproved products), or are approved but are to be used for unapproved ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious diseases or conditions in the event of an emergency declaration by the HHS Secretary. 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(a)(1)-(2).
 On February 4, 2020, HHS Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for COVID-19, under 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), justifying the authorization of emergency use of IVDs for detection and/or diagnosis of COVID-19. This determination was published in the Federal Register on February 7, 2020. 85 Fed. Reg. 7316 (Feb. 7, 2020).
 While this emergency declaration is effective, the FDA may authorize the use of an unapproved product or an unapproved use of an approved product if it concludes that:
  
• | an agent referred to in the emergency declaration could cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it is reasonable to believe that the authorized product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing that disease or condition or a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by an approved product or a product marketed under an EUA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the known and potential benefits of the authorized product, when used for that disease or condition, outweigh known and potential risks, taking into consideration the material threat of agents identified in the emergency declaration;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the authorized product for diagnosing, preventing, or treating the relevant disease or condition;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any other criteria prescribed by the FDA is satisfied. Id. § 360bbb-3(c).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Medical products that are granted an EUA are only permitted to commercialize their products under the terms and conditions provided in the authorization. The FDA may revoke an EUA where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization, if the conditions for the issuance of the EUA are no longer met, or if other circumstances make revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety, and we cannot predict how long the EUAs for the SARS-CoV-2 tests will remain in place.
 The Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR test and the Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab test have been granted FDA EUA pursuant to the current emergency declaration. We have completed all required performance verification studies to validate the use of the tests in our laboratories in accordance with the FDA Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency, CAP and New York State Clinical Laboratory Standards of Practice (NYS CLEP) requirements. The FDA Policy for COVID-19 tests is a guidance document that explains the FDA’s current thinking on the topic, is subject to change, and does not establish any legally enforceable responsibilities. As stated in the FDA’s Policy for COVID-19, the FDA does not expect a separate notification or EUA request from laboratories that are performing testing using EUA-authorized test kits purchased from commercial manufacturers or their distributors. According to the FDA Policy for COVID-19 tests, a laboratory may make certain modifications to an EUA-authorized test if the modified test is validated using a bridging study without submitting an EUA amendment or formal notification. A laboratory may modify an EUA authorized test for use of a new specimen through a bridging study when the new specimen type has been previously authorized for another test of the same technology without submitting an EUA amendment or formal notification.
 Federal and State Laboratory Licensing Requirements
 The Biodesix Boulder, Colorado clinical laboratory is a College of American Pathology (CAP)-accredited clinical laboratory regulated by CMS pursuant to CLIA. CMS has granted CAP deeming authority under CLIA, which allows CAP to inspect laboratories in lieu of CMS. In addition to holding a CLIA Certificate and CAP laboratory accreditation, Biodesix’s Quality Management System (QMS) holds an ISO 13485:2016 certificate. The Biodesix Boulder, Colorado clinical laboratory has received approval from The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (NYS CLEP) in Soluble Tumor Markers and Molecular, Cellular Tumor Markers as well as holding state permits and licenses in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
 30


CLIA regulations establish standards for proficiency testing; facility administration; general laboratory systems; pre-analytic, analytic systems, post- analytic systems; personnel qualifications and responsibilities; quality control, quality assessment; and specific provisions for laboratories performing moderate to high complexity tests. Our Boulder, Colorado clinical laboratory is inspected biennially as part of its ongoing certification under CLIA certificate of accreditation by CAP. The Boulder, Colorado clinical laboratory most recently passed its CAP inspection in February 2019.
 Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of or assessment of health. CLIA requires that a laboratory hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations it performs and that it complies with, among other things, standards covering operations, personnel, facilities administration, quality systems and proficiency testing, which are intended to ensure, among other things, that clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely.
 The Biodesix De Soto, Kansas clinical laboratory is a COLA-accredited clinical laboratory regulated by CMS pursuant to CLIA. COLA Inc. (COLA) was founded in 1988 as a private alternative to help laboratories stay in compliance with CLIA. In 1993, the Health Care Financing Administration (now CMS) granted COLA deeming authority under CLIA, and in 1997 The Joint Commission also recognized COLA Inc.’s laboratory accreditation program. The De Soto, Kansas clinical laboratory is inspected biennially by COLA. The De Soto, Kansas clinical laboratory most recently passed inspection in August 2019. The De Soto, Kansas clinical laboratory also holds state permits and licenses in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island.
 The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization that defines world-class specifications for products, services and systems, to ensure quality, safety and efficiency. ISO 13485:2016 is a harmonized, international regulatory benchmark for quality management systems that addresses most or all of the QMS requirements in markets including the United States, European Union, Australia, Japan and Canada. The ISO 13485:2016 certificate confirms that an organization operates a QMS that conforms to the standards established by ISO. The FDA has proposed a rule to harmonize and modernize its QSR, which would supplant the existing requirements with ISO 13485:2016 although this rule has been delayed several times spring 2018. In February 2021, we passed an ISO 13485:2016 inspection.
 To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. Laboratories such as ours, which are performing high complexity testing, are required to meet more stringent CLIA requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests, and therefore our laboratories are also subject to random, unannounced survey and inspection at any time. In addition, a laboratory that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA may develop, manufacture, validate and use proprietary LDTs. CLIA requires analytical validation including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and establishment of a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time and any such changes could have a material effect on our business.
 CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that out-of-state laboratories maintain an in-state laboratory license to perform tests on samples from patients who reside in that state. As a condition of licensure, certain states may require that laboratory personnel meet qualifications, quality control procedures, facility requirements, record maintenance requirements or other state-specific requirements.
 Because our Boulder, Colorado clinical laboratory is located in the State of Colorado, we do not need a specific State of Colorado laboratory license, however, we maintain licenses to conduct testing in other states where nonresident laboratories are required to obtain state laboratory licenses. We maintain licenses for our Boulder, Colorado and De Soto, Kansas laboratories with the New York State Dept. of Health (NYSDOH). We also hold licenses in other states in which we operate, including California, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, that require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. Other states may currently have or adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which may require us to modify, delay or stop its operations in those states until such requirements are met.
 31


Failure to comply with CLIA certification and state clinical laboratory licensure requirements may result in a range of enforcement actions, including certificate or license suspension, limitation, or revocation, directed plan of action, onsite monitoring, civil monetary penalties, criminal sanctions, and revocation of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid payment for its services, as well as significant adverse publicity.
 CLIA and state laws and regulations, operating together, sometimes limit the ability of laboratories to offer consumer-initiated testing, also known as direct access testing. We do not offer direct access testing and instead require that our tests be ordered by licensed healthcare providers.
 Our Boulder, Colorado and De Soto, Kansas laboratories are certified and adhere to the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (NYS CLEP), based on New York State Public Health Law, Article 5 Title 5. New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program is exempt from CLIA and establishes their own method of laboratory certification and test validation approval. To process New York State patient specimens a laboratory must submit a robust analytical and clinical validation package to demonstrate clinical utility of the test and receive approval prior to offering the test in the state of New York. Our GeneStrat and VeriStrat tests have received New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program approval. New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program requires semi- annual inspections to ensure the laboratory meets all general and specialty standards. Biodesix passed New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program inspection in May 2019 and is currently scheduled for a routine re-inspection in May 2021.
 Regulatory framework for medical devices in the United States
 Pursuant to its authority under the FDCA, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, IVDs. The FDA regulates the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, pre-market clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, marketing, promotion, sales, distribution and import and export of medical devices. It is possible that one of our current, or future, tests will be subject to FDA authority and oversight as either an IVD or a CDx pursuant to the FDA’s authority to regulate medical devices under the FDCA.
 Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere, including by the FDA and its foreign counterparts.  Government regulations specific to medical devices are wide ranging and govern, among other things:
  
• | product design, development, manufacture, and release;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | laboratory and clinical testing, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product safety and efficacy;
--+-----------------------------


• | premarketing clearance or approval;
--+------------------------------------


• | service operations;
--+--------------------


• | record keeping;
--+----------------


• | product marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market approval studies; and
--+----------------------------------


• | product import and export
--+--------------------------

 Market access, sales and marketing of medical devices in non-U.S. countries are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Economic 
 Area (EEA), a medical device must meet the Medical Devices Directive’s (MDD)/In Vitro Medical Devices Directive’s (IVDD) Essential Requirements or, applicable on May 26, 2021, the Medical Devices Regulation’s (MDR) / applicable on May 26, 2022, In Vitro Medical Devices Regulation’s (IVDR) General Safety and Performance Requirements which apply to it, taking into account its intended purpose as defined by the data supplied by the manufacturer on the label, in the instructions for use or in promotional or sales materials or 
 32


statements and as specified by the manufacturer in the clinical evaluation. Before placing a medical device on the EEA market, the manufacturer must draw up a declaration of conformity, certifying that the device complies with the MDD/IVDD/MDR/IVDR, and must then affix the CE mark. For medium and high-risk devices as well as low risk devices that are placed on the market in sterile condition, have a measuring function, or are reusable surgical instruments, the manufacturer must obtain a CE Certificate from a notified body. The notified body typically audits and examines the device’s technical documentation, including the clinical evaluation, and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the relevant device before issuing a CE Certificate. Following the issuance of this CE Certificate, manufacturers may draw up the declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the devices covered by this CE Certificate. 
 Manufacturers of medical devices must document in a clinical evaluation report (CER) the evaluation of the clinical data related to the device. The CER is part of the device’s technical file. The evaluation shall document that the applicable Essential Requirements/General Safety and Performance Requirements are met and document the evaluation of the undesirable side-effects and the acceptability of the benefit-risk- ratio. The CER must be updated based on information from the post-market surveillance and vigilance activities related to the device. The CER shall consist, inter alia, of analyzed clinical data collected from a clinical investigation of the device, or the results of other studies on substantially equivalent devices. Reliance on “substantially equivalent” devices is very restrictive and requires, inter alia, that the manufacturer has full access to the technical documentation of the equivalent device on an ongoing basis and, if the “equivalent device” is not its own, that the manufacture has in place a contract with the manufacturer of the “equivalent device.”
 Similar requirements apply in the UK. For access to the UK market, manufacturers must obtain a UKCA Certificate and affix a UKCA mark to their medical devices. However, the CE mark will be accepted in the UK until July 1, 2023.
 Device classification
 Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III, depending on the degree of risk to patients that is associated with each medical device and the amount of oversight needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness of the medical device.
 Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
 Class II devices are subject to the General Controls as well as any special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements.
 Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk: such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, implantable devices, or those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device following the 510(k) process. CDx tests are regularly considered Class III devices.
 Premarket submission process
 Unless a statutory or regulatory exemption or enforcement discretion policy applies, before a new medical device, or a new intended use of, claim for, or significant modification to an existing device, can be marketed in the United States, the manufacturer must obtain the FDA’s: (1) permission for commercial distribution under section 510(k) of the FDCA (510(k) clearance); or (2) approval of a PMA; or (3) de novo classification and authorization. These processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees.
 33


Under the 510(k) clearance process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and therefore a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Premarket notifications typically include bench, analytical, and preclinical data. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. If a manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance for its device and then makes a modification that could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness or constitutes a major change or modification in the intended use of the device, a new clearance, authorization or approval may be required.
 By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous, costly, and time-consuming PMA approval process or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process.
 To obtain a PMA, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling, and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
 Once filed as a PMA, the FDA has 180 days to review the filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA.
 Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of any clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of any manufacturing facility and processes. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including (1) the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction; (2) the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval; (3) the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and (4) changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when data is available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy. A number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for any modifications to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process.
 34


As a condition of PMA application approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer-term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.
 Alternatively, the FDA also allows the submission of a direct de novo petition. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination.
 The 510(k), de-novo or PMA processes can be expensive, lengthy and unpredictable. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but can last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA. In addition, a PMA generally requires the performance of one or more clinical trials. Despite the time, effort and cost, a device may not be approved or cleared by the FDA. Any delay or failure to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the device, which may limit the market for the device.
 Companion Diagnostics and the Premarket Process
 We believe that one of our future product candidates may include a companion diagnostic or complementary diagnostic (collectively CDx). CDx’s can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. The use of the CDx will be stipulated in the labeling of both the CDx and the therapeutic product. The FDA may require an application for the CDx separate from the drug approval process, and this could potentially delay the approval of any new drug application or the CDx, or complicate the review process. CDx’s are generally regulated as Class III medical devices by the FDA and are therefore most often subject to the PMA approval process.
 The FDA issued guidance in July 2016 for the co-development of CDx tests with a therapeutic product and issued another draft guidance in December 2018 specific to oncology CDx tests. The FDA finalized this draft guidance in April 2020 in “Developing and Labeling In vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices for a Specific Group of Oncology Therapeutic Products.” The guidance is meant to guide the development of CDx products, which are defined as IVDs that provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product. A CDx is often developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, and the use of the CDx is stipulated in the labeling of both the CDx and the corresponding therapeutic product. While it supports contemporaneous marketing authorizations, if there are any deficiencies in the submissions, the FDA may place a PMA review of a CDx on hold or request additional testing, which could potentially delay the approval of the corresponding new drug application or the marketing authorization of the CDx, or otherwise complicate the review process. Some oncology CDx tests can be developed in a way that results in labeling for a specific group of oncology therapeutic products, rather than a single therapeutic product.
 35


Post-Market FDA Regulation
 Even if regulatory clearance, authorization or approval of a device is granted, the FDA may impose limitations on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and the device remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared, authorized or approved. After a device, including a device exempt from FDA premarket review, is placed on the market, numerous post-market regulatory requirements apply, and the FDA has broad authority to enforce these requirements. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions such as: warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures, including requirements to repair, replace, and/or refund the cost of the devices, recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; the FDA’s refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products; the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs that have already been granted and criminal prosecution. In the event that a supplier fails to maintain compliance with the FDA’s or our quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 We are subject to federal fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), the federal prohibition against physician self- referral (Stark Law), the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA), and the federal False Claims Act (FCA). We are also subject to similar state and foreign fraud and abuse laws.
 The AKS prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce such person to refer an individual, or to purchase, lease, order, arrange for, or recommend purchasing, leasing or ordering, any item or service that may be reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the AKS that provide protection from AKS liability to arrangements that fully satisfy the applicable requirements.
 EKRA prohibits knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of a patient to, or in exchange for an individual using the services of certain entities, including laboratories, if the services are covered by a health care benefit program. The term “health care benefit program” is broadly defined such that EKRA extends to referrals reimbursed by both governmental and commercial third-party payers. EKRA includes a number of statutory exceptions that provide protection from EKRA liability if the applicable requirements are met.
 The Stark Law generally prohibits, among other things, clinical laboratories and other so-called “designated health services” entities from billing Medicare for any services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has a financial relationship, such as a direct or indirect investment interest in or compensation arrangement with the billing entity, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. The Stark Law also prohibits physicians from making such referrals to a designated health services entity. There are also similar state laws that apply where Medicaid and/or commercial payers are billed.
 The FCA imposes civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the government that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to such a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. This statute also permits a private individual acting as a “qui tam” whistleblower to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after June 19, 2020, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015.
 36


Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payer knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier, and contracting with an individual or entity that the person knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program. In addition, federal criminal statutes created by HIPAA prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition to these federal laws, there are often similar state anti-kickback and false claims laws that typically apply to arrangements involving reimbursement by a state-funded Medicaid or other health care program. Often, these laws closely follow the language of their federal law counterparts, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payers, including commercial payers.
 A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, and, in some states, marketing expenditures. In addition, some state statutes impose outright bans on certain manufacturer gifts to physicians or other health care professionals. Some of these laws, referred to as “aggregate spend” or “gift” laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated.
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs and extensive annual trainings for all of our employees and contractors. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.
 Anti-Corruption
 The FCPA and similar international bribery laws make it unlawful for entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining and maintaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business, to any person. In addition to the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, the statute also contains accounting requirements designed to operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions. Covered companies are required to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. With our international operations through our third-party partnerships, we could incur significant fines and penalties, as well as criminal liability, if we fail to comply with either the anti-bribery or accounting requirements of the FCPA, or similar international bribery laws. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our compliance with these laws could cause us to incur adverse publicity and significant legal and related costs.

Privacy and Data Protection Laws
 Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of protected health information (PHI) and personal information. In the course of performing our business we obtain personal information, including PHI. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Under HIPAA and HITECH, the HHS, issues regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities (CEs) and their authorized business associates (BAs). Because we are a health care provider that electronically transmits health care information, we are at times either a CE or a BA, as defined by HIPAA. Our subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, transmit or otherwise process PHI on our behalf are HIPAA BAs and must also comply with HIPAA, as applicable.
 HIPAA and HITECH include the privacy and security rules, breach notification requirements and electronic transaction standards. The privacy rule governs the use and disclosure of PHI by CEs and BAs. The privacy rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI except as permitted under the rule. The rule also sets forth individual patient rights, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing such individual’s PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of such individual’s PHI. The security rule requires CEs and BAs to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically transmitted or stored PHI (also referred to as ePHI) by implementing administrative, physical and technical safeguards. Under HITECH’s breach notification rule, a CE must notify individuals, the Secretary of HHS, and in some circumstances, the media of certain breaches of unsecured PHI or ePHI.
 Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary depending on the number and nature of the violations and any history of prior violations, but can be significant and include civil monetary or criminal penalties. HIPAA is enforced by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights, and HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach resulting in improper access to PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA CEs, such as us, and their BAs for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator.
 In addition, we may be subject to state privacy, cybersecurity, and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. California, for example, has enacted the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which, in addition to HIPAA and HITECH, sets forth standards with which all California health care providers must abide. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. For instance, the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA has been amended from time to time, and it remains unclear what, if any, further modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. Although there are certain exemptions for PHI and clinical trial data, the CCPA’s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future and the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Additionally, a California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was adopted by California voters. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It would also create a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that could continue to make compliance challenging and costly.
 38


Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general enforce consumer protection laws that prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices, including Section 5 of the FTC Act, which creates standards for the collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices regarding privacy and security can lead to significant liabilities and consequences, including regulatory investigations, penalties, fines and orders as well as civil claims, which could impact our data practices and operations or cause reputational damage.
 We may also be subject to laws and regulations in foreign countries covering data privacy and other protection of health and employee information that may add additional compliance burden and complexity. For example, in the EEA, the collection and use of personal data is governed by the GDPR. In the United Kingdom, the GDPR will be adopted in substantially the same form. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, store, transfer and otherwise process personal data. European and United Kingdom data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA or United Kingdom. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. GDPR applies extra-territorially under certain circumstances and imposes stringent requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, requirements to ensure a legal bases to process personal information, provide robust disclosures to individuals, facilitate data subject rights, provide data security breach notifications within 72 hours after discovering a breach in certain circumstances, limit retention of personal information and apply enhanced protections to health data and other categories of sensitive personal information. The GDPR also has requirements around international transfers of personal data. Requirements around transfers to the United States and other jurisdictions have increased since a July 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the Privacy Shield as a basis to transfer personal data from Europe to the United States, and added requirements for reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses. Regulatory guidance on requirements for international transfers, and other GDPR compliance matters, continues to evolve. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of our preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. To comply with the GDPR and other applicable international data protection laws and regulations, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance, which may result in other substantial expenditures.
 Cybersecurity
 Our business relies on secure and continuous processing of information and the availability of our IT networks and IT resources, as well as critical IT vendors that support our technology, research and other data processing operations. While we take steps to protect our systems and data, security incidents, data breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent across industries, including the life sciences sector, and may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers. Unauthorized persons may in the future be able to exploit weaknesses in the security systems of our (or our third-party service providers) IT networks and gain access to PHI and other personal information, or sensitive trade secrets or other proprietary information. Any wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, other personal information, trade secrets or other proprietary information by us or our third-party service providers could subject us to regulatory fines or penalties, third-party claims or otherwise could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although HIPAA and the regulations promulgated thereunder do not provide for a private right of action, failures to adequately protect PHI or our IT systems could be viewed as violations of the HIPAA security rule or violations of other applicable information security laws, regulations, contractual obligations or industry standards, and could further result in costly data breach notification obligations that negatively impact our reputation.
 Moreover, data security incidents or data breaches, as well as attacks on our IT systems, could result in operational disruptions or data loss or corruption that could adversely impact our business and operations, result in substantial investment of resources to investigate, recover and remediate and subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny.

International Regulations
 Many countries in which we may offer any of our diagnostic tests in the future have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national health care program. In situations involving physicians employed by state-funded institutions or national health care agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the FCPA.
 The FCPA prohibits any United States individual, business entity or employee of a United States business entity to offer or provide, directly or through a third party, including any potential distributors we may rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign government official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We will also be required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
 The standard of intent and knowledge in anti-bribery cases is minimal. Intent and knowledge are usually inferred from that fact that bribery took place. The accounting provisions do not require intent. Violations of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions for corporations and other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $2 million and officers, directors, stockholders, employees, and agents are subject to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members, have similar anti-corruption regulations, such as the United Kingdom Anti-Bribery Act.
 When marketing our diagnostic tests outside of the United States, we may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, prohibitions on the import of tissue necessary for us to perform our diagnostic tests or restrictions on the export of tissue imposed by countries outside of the United States or the import of tissue into the United States, and marketing approval. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may in some cases require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.
 Market access, sales and marketing of medical devices in non-U.S. countries are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Economic Area (EEA), a medical device must meet MDDs/ IVDD Essential Requirements or, applicable on May 26, 2021, the MDR applicable on May 26, 2022, IVDR General Safety and Performance Requirements which apply to it, taking into account its intended purpose as defined by the data supplied by the manufacturer on the label, in the instructions for use or in promotional or sales materials or statements and as specified by the manufacturer in the clinical evaluation. Before placing a medical device on the EEA market, the manufacturer must draw up a declaration of conformity, certifying that the device complies with the MDD/IVDD/MDR/IVDR, and must then affix the CE mark. For medium and high-risk devices as well as low risk devices that are placed on the market in sterile condition, have a measuring function, or are reusable surgical instruments, the manufacturer must obtain a CE Certificate from a notified body. The notified body typically audits and examines the device’s technical documentation, including the clinical evaluation, and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the relevant device before issuing a CE Certificate. Following the issuance of this CE Certificate, manufacturers may draw up the declaration of conformity and affix the CE mark to the devices covered by this CE Certificate.
 
Manufacturers of medical devices must document in a CER the evaluation of the clinical data related to the device. The CER is part of the device’s technical file. The evaluation shall document that the applicable Essential Requirements/General Safety and Performance Requirements are met and document the evaluation of the undesirable side-effects and the acceptability of the benefit-risk- ratio. The CER must be updated based on information from the post-market surveillance and vigilance activities related to the device. The CER shall consist, inter alia, of analyzed clinical data collected from a clinical investigation of the device, or the results of other studies on substantially equivalent devices. Reliance on “substantially equivalent” devices is very restrictive and requires, inter alia, that the manufacturer has full access to the technical documentation of the equivalent device on an ongoing basis and, if the “equivalent device” is not its own, that the manufacture has in place a contract with the manufacturer of the “equivalent device.”
 
40



Similar requirements apply in the UK. For access to the UK market, manufacturers must obtain a UKCA Certificate and affix a UKCA mark to their medical devices. However, the CE mark will be accepted in the UK until July 1, 2023.
 Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in the United States. The ACA made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private insurers. For example, the ACA requires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. The medical device tax was permanently repealed at the end of 2019. The ACA also contains a number of other provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters, and fraud and abuse, which we expect will impact our industry and our operations in ways that we cannot currently predict.
 While the Biden administration has recently signaled its intent to pursue policies strengthening the ACA, the Trump administration and Congress sought to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. The Trump administration issued three executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. For example, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed appropriations legislation for fiscal year 2020 that repealed certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2019; the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, for calendar years beginning December 31, 2020; and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices, for sales after December 31, 2019. While Congress has not passed comprehensive legislation that would repeal all or part of the ACA, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) among other things, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment, or penalty, imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the ACA’s individual mandate, without the penalty that was repealed effective January 1, 2019, was unconstitutional and could not be severed from the ACA. As a result, the court ruled the remaining provisions of the ACA were also invalid. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, but it remanded the case back to the district court for further analysis of whether the mandate could be severed from the ACA; that is, whether the entire ACA was therefore also unconstitutional. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari on March 2, 2020 and heard oral argument on November 10, 2020; the case is expected to be decided in 2021.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, led to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year that started in 2013 and, due to subsequent statutory amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In 2020, the CARES Act temporarily suspended the 2% cut in Medicare payments from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and it extended the sequestrian reductions through FY 2030 to offset the cost of such temporary suspension. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 further extended the temporary suspension through March 31, 2021. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made other changes, including reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve R&D, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop. Additionally, the Biden administration has already indicated a shift in direction from Trump administration policies by issuing orders and other documents rolling back regulations and Executive Orders from the Trump administration, and as noted, indicating that it will pursue policies strengthening the ACA. The recent change in presidential administration could materially impact our business in ways that are difficult to predict.

In December 2020, in its enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress enacted the No Surprises Act. This law, which takes effect January 1, 2022, bars an out-of-network providers from billing patients in excess of the in-network cost sharing for services furnished with respect to a visit at certain in-network health care facilities. The law establishes an independent dispute resolution process between the provider and the payer to determine the appropriate payment rate to the provider. As written, the No Surprises Act may apply to laboratory tests furnished by an independent laboratory with respect to a hospital visit. The law establishes a notice and consent exception that generally does not apply to laboratory tests, although it allows HHS to apply this exception to certain advanced tests. Additional information on the applicability of the No Surprises Act, any applicability of the notice and consent exception to advanced tests, and the rules governing the independent dispute resolution process may be determined in rulemaking and subregulatory guidance from HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury in 2021.  
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Reimbursement for laboratory tests in the United States is determined by various payers, including private third-party payers, managed care organizations, and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In Medicare, coverage of an item or service depends on whether it is “reasonable and necessary” under the section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (SSA). For single-source laboratory tests, this determination is typically made by the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) with jurisdiction over the laboratory where the test is performed. Our Boulder, Colorado laboratory is currently under the jurisdiction of Novitas Solutions, Inc. Our De Soto, Kansas laboratory is under the jurisdiction of Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation, which participates in the MolDX program (administered by another MAC, Palmetto GBA) to set coverage policy for molecular diagnostic tests. 
 
Medicare pays for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (CDLTs), on the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS). Section 216(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), added section 1834A to the SSA, which established the current CLFS rate setting processes and coding provisions for CDLTs, and created a new subcategory of CDLTs called Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (ADLTs), with separate reporting and payment requirements.
 
Under section 1834A and its implementing regulations, clinical laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS and the Physician Fee Schedule report on a triennial basis (or annually for ADLTs), private payer rates and volumes for their tests with specific billing codes based on final payments made during a set data collection period. The payment rate for a test for the ensuing three-year period (or one year for ADLTs) is set at the weighted median of the rates reported under the specific billing code for that test. Newly established codes for CDLTs are priced until the next private payer rate reporting cycle either based on the payment rate of a comparable code on the CLFS (as determined by CMS) or at the median of rates submitted by the individual MACs based on statutory and regulatory factors. New ADLTs are initially priced at “actual list charge” for a nine-month period, after which they are priced based on private payer rates, with a recoupment provision if actual list charge is more than 130% of the weighted median of private payer rates reported. 
 
The various payers in the United States also determine their own billing rules. In December 2020, Medicare revised its billing rules for clinical laboratory tests to require cancer-related protein-based Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses to be billed directly to Medicare by the performing laboratory in most cases when performed on a specimen collected from a hospital outpatient. Molecular pathology tests and most ADLTs are also generally required to be billed directly to Medicare by the laboratory under these circumstances.  
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
 We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permitting and licensing requirements. Such laws include those governing laboratory practices, the generation, storage, use, manufacture, handling, transportation, treatment, remediation, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes and worker health and safety. Our operations involve the generation, use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, and the risk of injury, contamination or non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permitting or licensing requirements cannot be eliminated. In particular, the introduction of our Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR and Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab tests requires that we maintain compliance with applicable and evolving federal and state laws and regulations relating to COVID-19, including the generation, use, storage, and disposal of testing materials and agents. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earning or competitive position.

Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 2005 as Elston Technologies, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 2970 Wilderness Place, Suite 100, Boulder, Colorado 80301, and our telephone number is (303) 417-0500. On June 20, 2006, we changed our name to Biodesix, Inc.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company
 We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including the requirement that our internal control over financial reporting be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain requirements related to the disclosure of executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, the requirement that we hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
 We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards and to adopt certain of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. As a result of the accounting standards election, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing for new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, which may make comparison of our financials to those of other public companies more difficult. Additionally, because we have taken advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (ii) the date we qualify as a “large accelerated filer,” with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the date on which we have issued, in any three-year period, more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (iv) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering.
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (ii) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
 For certain risks related to our status as an emerging growth company, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Common Stock—We are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.”
