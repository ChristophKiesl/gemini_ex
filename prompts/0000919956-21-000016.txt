ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introductory Summary.
Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. provides post-acute care services to skilled nursing facilities, referred to as "skilled nursing centers," "nursing centers," or "centers," patients and residents in eight states, primarily in the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest United States. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to “Diversicare,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” include Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. and all of our consolidated subsidiaries. Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1994.
The post-acute care profession encompasses a broad range of non-institutional and institutional services. For those among the aging, infirmed, or disabled requiring temporary or limited special services, a variety of home care options exist. As the need for assistance with activities of daily living develop, assisted living centers become the most viable and cost effective option. For those amongst the aging, disabled, or infirmed requiring more extensive assistance and intensive care, skilled nursing center care may become the only viable option. We have chosen to focus our business primarily on the skilled nursing centers sector and to specialize in this aspect of the post-acute care continuum.
Principal Address and Website.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1621 Galleria Boulevard, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027. Our telephone number at that address is 615.771.7575, and our facsimile number is 615.771.7409. Our website is located at www.dvcr.com. The information on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Operating and Growth Strategy.
Our operating objective is to optimize market position in the delivery of health care and related services to the patients and residents in need of post-acute care in the communities in which we operate. Our strategic operations development plan focuses on (i) providing a broad range of high quality, cost-effective post-acute care services; (ii) improving skilled mix in our nursing centers via enhanced capabilities for rehabilitation and transitional care; (iii) building clinical competencies and programs consistent with marketplace needs; and (iv) clustering our operations on a regional basis. Interwoven into our objectives and operating strategy is our mission:
        • Improve Every Life We Touch 
        • Provide Exceptional Healthcare 
        • Exceed Expectations
• Increase Shareholder Value
Strategic operating initiatives. Our key strategic operating initiatives include improving skilled mix in our nursing centers by enhancing our staffing complement to address the increased medical complexity of certain patients, increasing clinical competencies, and adding clinical programs. Our investments in nursing and clinical care and nursing center-based sales representatives to cultivate referral and Managed Care relationships have positioned us to admit higher acuity patients. 
To achieve our objectives, we:
Provide a broad range of quality cost-effective services. Our objective is to provide a variety of services to meet the needs of the increasing post-acute care population requiring skilled nursing and rehabilitation care. Our service offerings currently include skilled nursing, comprehensive rehabilitation services, programming for Memory Care units (described below) and other specialty programming. By addressing varying levels of acuity, we work to meet the needs of the population we serve. We seek to establish a reputation as the provider of choice in each of our markets. Furthermore, we believe we are able to deliver quality services cost-effectively, compared to other healthcare providers along the spectrum of care, thereby expanding the population base that can benefit from our services.
Improve skilled mix in our nursing centers. By enhancing our registered nurse coverage and adding specialized clinical care, we believe we can admit patients with more medically complex conditions, thereby improving skilled mix and reimbursement. The investments in nursing and clinical care are being conducted in concert with additional investments in nursing center-based sales representatives to develop referral and Managed Care relationships. These investments will better attract quality payor sources for patients covered by Medicare, Managed Care and Medicare replacement payors as well as certain private pay individuals. We will also continue our program for the renovation and improvement of our nursing centers to attract and retain patients and residents. 
Cluster operations on a regional basis. We have developed regional concentrations of operations in order to achieve operating efficiencies, generate economies of scale and capitalize on marketing opportunities created by having multiple operations in a regional market area.
Key elements of our strategy are to: 
Increase revenues and profitability at existing nursing centers. Our strategy includes increasing center revenues and profitability through improving payor mix, providing an increasing level of higher acuity care, obtaining appropriate reimbursement for the care we provide, and providing high quality patient care. Ongoing investments are being made in expanded nursing and clinical care. We continue to enhance center-based marketing initiatives to promote higher occupancy levels and improved skilled mix at our nursing centers. 
Development of additional specialty services. Our strategy includes the development of additional specialty units and programming in nursing centers that could benefit from these services. The specialty programming will vary depending on the needs of the specific market, and may include complex medical and rehabilitation services, as well as memory care units and other specialty programming. These services allow our centers to meet market needs while improving census and payor mix. A center specific assessment of the market and the current programming being offered is conducted related to specialty programming to determine if unmet needs exist as a predictor of the success of particular niche offerings and services.
Strategic management of our portfolio of centers. We continue to pursue and investigate opportunities to acquire and lease new centers, focusing primarily on opportunities that can leverage our existing infrastructure. We routinely evaluate the performance of our existing centers within the markets in which we operate in order to determine whether continuing operations within certain centers or markets aligns with our strategic objectives.
Nursing Centers and Services.
Diversicare provides a broad range of post-acute care services to patients and residents including skilled nursing, ancillary health care services, and assisted living. In addition to the nursing and social services usually provided in long-term care centers, we offer a variety of rehabilitative, nutritional, respiratory, and other specialized ancillary services. As of December 31, 2020, our continuing operations consist of 61 nursing centers with 7,250 licensed skilled nursing beds. Our nursing centers range in size from 50 to 320 licensed nursing beds. The licensed nursing bed count does not include 397 licensed assisted living beds. Our continuing operations include centers in Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.
The following table summarizes certain information with respect to the nursing centers we own or lease as of December 31, 2020:

____________
(1)The number of Licensed Nursing Beds is based on the regulatory licenses for the nursing center. The Company reports its occupancy based on licensed nursing beds. The number of Available Nursing Beds represents Licensed Nursing Beds reduced by beds removed from service. Available Nursing Beds is subject to change based upon the needs of the centers, including configuration of patient rooms, common usage areas and offices, status of beds (private, semi-private, ward, etc.) and renovations. The number of Licensed and Available Nursing Beds does not include 397 Licensed Assisted Living/Residential Beds, all of which are also available. These beds are excluded from the bed counts as our operating statistics such as occupancy are calculated using Nursing Beds only.
Our nursing centers provide skilled nursing health care services, including nutrition services, recreational therapy, social services, housekeeping, and laundry services. Skilled nursing care is provided for post-acute patients and residents with comorbidities. This care includes assessment using evidence based tools, individualized care plan development based on identified areas of risk and care needs, and skilled interventions such as IV services. We also provide for the delivery of ancillary medical services at the nursing centers we operate. These specialty services include rehabilitation therapy services, such as audiology, speech, occupational, and physical therapies, which are provided through licensed therapists and registered nurses, and the provision of medical supplies, nutritional support, infusion therapies and related clinical services. The majority of these services are provided using our internal resources and clinicians.
Within the framework of a nursing center, we may provide other specialty care, including:
Transitional Care Unit. Many of our nursing centers have units designated as transitional care units, our designation for patients requiring transitional care following an acute stay in the hospital. These units specialize in short-term nursing and rehabilitation with the goal of returning the patient to their highest potential level of functionality. These units provide enhanced services with emphasis on upgraded amenities. The design and programming of the units generally appeal to the clinical and hospitality needs of individuals as they progress to the next appropriate level of care. Specialized therapeutic treatment regimens include orthopedic rehabilitation, neurological rehabilitation, and complex medical rehabilitation. While these patients generally have a shorter length of stay, the intensive level of nursing and rehabilitation required by these patients typically results in higher levels of reimbursement.
Memory Care Unit. Like our transitional care units, many of our nursing centers have memory care units, our designation for advanced care for dementia-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The goal of the units is to provide a safe, homelike and supportive environment for cognitively impaired patients, utilizing an interdisciplinary team approach. Family and community involvement complement structured programming in the secure environment, which is instrumental in fostering as much resident independence and purposeful quality of life as long as possible despite diminished capacity.
Enhanced Therapy Services. We have complemented our traditional therapy services with programs that provide electrotherapy, vital stimulation, ultrasound, and shortwave diathermy therapy treatments that promote pain management, wound healing, muscle strengthening, and/or contractures management, improving outcomes for our patients and residents receiving therapy treatments. 
Other Specialty Programming. We implement other specialty programming based on a center's specific needs. We have developed specialty programming for bariatric patients (generally, patients weighing more than 350 pounds) as these individuals have unique psychosocial and equipment needs. 
Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement. We have in place a Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (“QAPI”) program, which is focused on monitoring and improving all aspects of the care provided in a center by identifying outcomes and acting on areas of improvement. The QAPI program in our centers addresses all systems of care and management practices. Key quality indicators are determined and performance goals and benchmarks are established based on industry research standards via a Balanced Scorecard. Gaps and opportunities in performance versus benchmarks are addressed with analysis and performance improvement plans. Outcomes from each center in the areas of quality, employee workplace, customer satisfaction, and stewardship are collected monthly and overseen by regional and company quality committees. 
Utilization of Electronic Medical Records. Electronic Medical Records (“EMR”) improves our ability to accurately record the care provided to our patients and quickly respond to areas of need. All of our nursing centers utilize EMR to improve Medicaid acuity capture, primarily in our states where the Medicaid payments are acuity based. By using EMR, we have increased our average Medicaid rate despite rate cuts in certain acuity based states by accurate and timely capture of care delivery. We believe the EMR system provides better support, efficiency, and improves the quality of care for our patients. 
Organization. Our nursing centers are currently organized into seven regions, each of which is supervised by a regional vice president. The regional vice president is generally supported by specialists in several functions, including clinical, human resources, marketing, revenue cycle management and administration, all of whom are employed by us. The day-to-day operations of each of our nursing centers are led by an on-site, licensed administrator. The administrator of each nursing center is supported by other professional personnel, including a medical director, who assists in the medical management of the nursing center, and a director of nursing, who supervises a team of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nurse aides. Other personnel include those providing therapy, dietary, activities and social service, housekeeping, laundry, maintenance, and office services. The majority of personnel at our nursing centers, including the administrators, are our employees. 
Marketing.
We believe that skilled nursing care is fundamentally a local business in which both patients and their referral sources are typically based in the immediate geographic area in which the nursing center is located. Our marketing plan and related support activities emphasize the role and contributions of the administrators, admissions coordinators, and clinical liaisons of each nursing center, all of whom are responsible for developing relationships with various referral sources such as doctors, hospitals, hospital case managers and discharge planners, and various healthcare and community organizations. Training, sales tools and job aids are provided for the sales and marketing teams for the product knowledge, market knowledge, and selling skills necessary to support their efforts in the field. As part of our business strategy, we have dedicated sales and marketing personnel who develop strong partnerships with physicians and hospital executives as well as Accountable Care Organizations ("ACO"), Bundled Payments for Care Improvement ("BPCI") providers, and Managed Care organizations. We believe these relationships will be mutually beneficial, providing the community with high quality healthcare while helping customers to navigate choices, manage transitions, and control costs.
At the local level, our sales and marketing efforts are designed to:
•Identify and develop strong healthcare partnerships
•Help facilitate smooth transitions between care settings
•Promote collaboration with ACOs, BPCIs providers, and other healthcare organizations
•Educate referral sources and community on our key differentiators and capabilities 
•Position ourselves as a valuable resource and healthcare partner
•Enhance the customer experience
•Contribute to a strong community presence
•Promote higher occupancy levels
•Foster optimal payor mix
In addition to soliciting admissions from current and potential referral sources, we emphasize involvement in community and healthcare events and opportunities to promote a public awareness of our nursing centers and services. Activities include ongoing family councils and community based “family night” functions, providing the opportunity to educate the public on various topics such as Medicare benefits, powers of attorney, and other topics of interest. We also promote a positive customer experience, best practices, strong surveys, and a high star rating; we seek feedback through third-party resident and family surveys. We host tours and “open house” opportunities, where members of the local community are invited to visit the center to 
see any improvements or to better understand our environment and services. We look for ways to offer increased clinical capabilities and services to better meet the needs of the community and referral sources. In addition, we have regional oversight to support the overall marketing strategies in each local center, in order to promote higher occupancy levels and improved payor and case mixes at our nursing centers. We offer the resources and metrics for strong healthcare partnerships with our referral sources, including ACOs and other Managed Care partners. Our support center marketing personnel support regional and local marketing personnel and efforts.
We have monthly marketing programs and ongoing marketing initiatives, developed internally, that focus on educating and meeting the needs of our customers while growing our business. Resources are also available to assist each nursing center administrator in analysis of local demographics and competition with a view toward complementary service development. We consider the primary referral area in long-term care to generally lie within a five-to-fifteen-mile radius of each nursing center depending on population density; consequently, we focus on local marketing efforts rather than broad-based advertising.
Therapy Services
Effective November 1, 2020, the Company entered into agreements with a third party therapy company to outsource the therapy services that were previously provided by the Company through its wholly owned subsidiary Diversicare Therapy Services. The outsourced services include all physical, occupational, and speech therapy provided to patients of the Company’s facilities. The contracts are for a three-year term, absent termination for cause by either party. The third party provider has extensive expertise in providing therapy, and the Company believes that the therapy company's expertise in this area will benefit our patients and result in an overall operational cost savings for the Company.
Texas Quality Incentive Program 
During 2019, the Company expanded its participation in the Texas Quality Incentive Program ("QIPP") as administered by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. QIPP provides supplemental Medicaid payments for skilled nursing centers that achieve certain quality measures. Eleven of the Company’s Texas centers currently participate in the QIPP. To allow four of these centers to meet the QIPP participation requirements, the Company entered into a transaction with a Texas medical district already participating in the QIPP, providing for the transfer of the related provider licenses from the Company to the medical district. The Company’s operating subsidiary retained the management of the centers on behalf of the medical district. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission waived some of the performance and reporting requirements for QIPP effective March 1, 2020 through the remainder of the state's 2021 fiscal year.
Disposals
On December 1, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the assets and transfer of the operations of Diversicare of Fulton, LLC, Diversicare of Clinton, LLC and Diversicare of Glasgow, LLC (the “Kentucky Properties”) to Fulton Nursing and Rehabilitation LLC, Holiday Fulton Propco LLC, Birchwood Nursing and Rehabilitation LLC, Padgett Clinton Propco LLC, Westwood Nursing and Rehabilitation LLC, and Westwood Glasgow Propco for a purchase price of $18.7 million, On August 30, 2019, the Company terminated operations of ten centers in Kentucky and concurrently transferred operations to a new operator. These ten centers are collectively referred to as the "Kentucky Centers." The sale of the Kentucky Properties and the termination of operations at the Kentucky Centers are referred to collectively as the "Kentucky Exit." As a result of the Kentucky Exit, the Company no longer operates any skilled nursing centers in the State of Kentucky. The Kentucky Exit represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements- Discontinued Operations, the Company's discontinued operating results have been reclassified on the face of the income statement and the footnotes to reflect the discontinued status of these operations. Refer to Note 4, "Discontinued Operations" to the consolidated financial statements.
Lease Agreements
On October 1, 2018, the Company entered into a new Master Lease Agreement (the "Omega Master Lease") with Omega Healthcare Investors (the "Lessor") to lease 34 centers currently owned by Omega and operated by Diversicare. The old Master Lease with Omega provided for its operation of 23 skilled nursing centers in Texas, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, and Ohio. Additionally, Diversicare operated 11 centers owned by Omega under separate leases in Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. The Lease entered into by Diversicare and Omega consolidated the leases for all 34 centers under one new Maser Lease. The Lease was subsequently amended on August 30, 2019 when the Company terminated operations of the Kentucky Centers and concurrently transferred operations to a new operator. The agreement effectively amended the Lease with the Lessor to remove the ten Kentucky facilities, reduce the annual rent expense, and release the Company from any further obligations arising under the Master Lease Agreement with respect to the Kentucky facilities. The remaining Lease terms remain unchanged with an initial term of twelve years and two optional 10-year extensions. The annual lease fixed escalator remains at 2.15% which began on October 1, 2019.
On December 1, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Omega to transfer operations of a facility located in Florida to another operator. The agreement effectively amended the Master Lease to remove the center, reduced the annual rent 
expense, and released the Company from any further obligations arising under the Master Lease with respect to the Florida facility. The remaining Lease terms remain unchanged with an initial term of twelve years and two optional 10-year extensions. The annual lease fixed escalator remains at 2.15%.
Nursing Center Industry.
We believe there are a number of significant trends within the post-acute care industry that will support the continued growth of the nursing center profession. These trends are also likely to impact our business. These factors include:
Demographic trends. The primary market for our post-acute health care services is comprised of persons aged 75 and older. This age group is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population. As the number of persons aged 75 and over continues to grow, we believe that there will be corresponding increases in the number of persons who need skilled nursing care.
Cost containment pressures. In response to rapidly rising health care costs, governmental and other third-party payors have adopted cost-containment measures to reduce admissions and encourage reduced lengths of stays in hospitals and other acute care settings. As a result, hospitals are discharging patients earlier and referring elderly patients, who may be too sick or frail to manage their lives without assistance, to nursing centers where the cost of providing care is typically lower than hospital care. 
Limited supply of centers. As the nation's population of seniors continues to grow and life expectancy continues to expand, we believe that there will be continued demand for skilled nursing beds in the markets in which we operate. However, there continues to be limitations on opening new skilled nursing centers in most states, such as Certificate of Need (“CON”) laws. CON laws generally require a state agency to determine public need for any construction or expansion of healthcare facilities. We believe that CON requirements tend to restrict the supply and availability of licensed skilled nursing center beds. High construction costs, limitations on state and federal government reimbursement for the full costs of construction, and start-up expenses also act to restrict growth in the supply for such centers. 
Reduced reliance on family care. Historically, the family has been the primary provider of care for seniors. We believe that the increase in the percentage of dual income families, the reduction of average family size and the increased mobility in society will reduce the role of the family as the traditional care-giver for aging parents. We believe that this trend will make it necessary for many seniors to look outside the family for assistance as they age.
Competition.
The post-acute care business is highly competitive. We face direct competition for additional centers, and our centers face competition for employees and patients. Some of our present and potential competitors for acquisitions are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources. Competing companies may offer new or more modern centers or new or different services that may be more attractive to patients than some of the services we offer.
The nursing centers operated by us compete with other centers in their respective markets, including rehabilitation hospitals and other skilled and personal care residential centers. In the few urban markets in which we operate, some of the long-term care providers with which our centers compete are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than our centers. Some of these providers are not-for-profit organizations with access to sources of funds not available to our centers. Construction of new long-term care centers near our existing centers could adversely affect our business. We believe that the most important competitive factors in the long-term care business are: a nursing center's local reputation with referral sources, such as acute care hospitals, physicians, religious groups, other community organizations, Managed Care organizations, and a patient's family and friends; physical plant condition; the ability to identify and meet particular care needs in the community; the availability of qualified personnel to provide the requisite care; and the rates charged for services. There is limited, if any, price competition with respect to Medicaid and Medicare patients, since revenues for services to such patients are strictly controlled and are based on fixed rates and cost reimbursement principles. Although the degree of success with which our centers compete varies from location to location, we believe that our centers generally compete effectively with respect to these factors.
Revenue Sources.
We classify our revenues earned from patients and residents into four major categories: Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care, and Private Pay and Other. Medicaid revenues are those received under the traditional Medicaid program, which provides benefits to those in need of financial assistance in the securing of medical services. Medicare revenues include revenues received under both Part A and Part B. Managed Care revenues are received from insurance entities, including third-party plans that administer Medicare benefits, known as Medicare Advantage plans. Private Pay and Other revenues are composed primarily of individuals or parties who directly pay for their services. Included in the Private Pay and Other category are patients who are hospice beneficiaries as well as the recipients of Veterans Administration benefits. Veterans Administration payments are made pursuant to renewable contracts negotiated with these payors.
The Company recognized $17.0 million of Medicaid and Hospice stimulus dollars for the year ended December 31, 2020 that are reflected as patient revenues from Medicaid and Private Pay and Other in the Company's results of operations as included in the amounts presented in the table below. Refer to Note 2, "COVID-19 Pandemic" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information. The following table set forth net patient revenues related to our continuing operations by payor source for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands): Refer to Note 5, "Revenue Recognition and Receivables" to the consolidated financial statements.

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 
Medicaid | $ | 217,147 | | | 45.6 | % | | $ | 222,560 | | | 46.9 | %
Medicare | 94,375 | | | 19.8 | % | | 80,798 | | | 17.0 | % | | 
Managed Care | 49,708 | | | 10.4 | % | | 50,323 | | | 10.6 | % | | 
Private Pay and Other | 114,488 | | | 24.2 | % | | 121,339 | | | 25.5 | % | | 
Total | $ | 475,718 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 475,020 | | | 100.0 | %

The following table sets forth average daily skilled nursing census, or average number of patients per day, by payor source for our continuing operations for the periods presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2020 | 2019 | | 
Medicaid | 3,451 | | 66.9 | % | 3,912 | 68.9 | %
Medicare | 565 | | 10.9 | % | 529 | 9.3 | %
Managed Care | 253 | | 5.0 | % | 264 | 4.6 | %
Private Pay and Other | 892 | | 17.2 | % | 973 | 17.2 | %
Total | 5,161 | | 100.0 | % | 5,678 | 100.0 | %

Consistent with the nursing center industry in general, changes in the mix of a center's patient population among Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care, and Private Pay and Other can significantly affect the profitability of the center's operations. However, private payors, including managed care payors, are increasingly demanding that providers accept discounted fees or assume all or a portion of the financial risk for the delivery of health care services. Such measures may include capitated payments, which can result in significant losses to health care providers if patients require expensive treatment not adequately covered by the capitated rate.
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from government-sponsored health insurance programs, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. We employ third-party specialists in reimbursement and also use these services to monitor regulatory developments to comply with reporting requirements and to ensure that proper payments are made to our nursing centers.
Medicare
 Medicare is a federally-funded and administered health insurance program for the aged and for certain chronically disabled individuals. Part A of the Medicare program covers certain services furnished by skilled nursing centers and other institutional providers and inpatient hospital services. Part B covers physician services, durable medical equipment, various outpatient services and certain ancillary services. Under the Managed Medicare program, also known as Medicare Part C or Medicare Advantage, the federal government contracts with private health insurers to provide members with Medicare benefits. The plans may choose to offer supplemental benefits and impose higher premiums and cost-sharing obligations. An executive order issued in October 2019 seeks to accelerate the shift away from traditional fee-for-service Medicare to Managed Medicare plans. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will continue these efforts.
Skilled nursing facilities. Medicare generally covers skilled nursing center services for beneficiaries who require nursing care or rehabilitation services after a qualifying hospital stay. Medicare pays a per diem rate for each beneficiary, adjusted for patient acuity and additional factors such as geographic differences in wage rates. The payment rates are set forth under a prospective payment system that uses nursing and therapy indexes to assign a payment rate to each beneficiary. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) updates the rates annually. The payment rates cover all services to be provided to a beneficiary, including room and board, skilled nursing care, therapy, and medications.
In a final rule issued in July 2019, CMS set forth Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”) for federal fiscal year 2020, estimating a 2.4% increase in overall payments. This is based on a SNF market basket percentage increase of 2.8% with a negative 0.4 percentage point productivity adjustment. Effective October 1, 2019, CMS replaced the Resource 
Utilization Group (“RUG-IV”) case-mix classification system with the Patient-Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”). The PDPM classifies residents in Medicare Part A-covered stays into payment groups based on clinically relevant factors using diagnosis codes, rather than by the volume of services. CMS has stated that it does not intend for the new model to change the aggregate amount of Medicare payments to SNFs. Rather, it intends the new model to more accurately reflect resource utilization. 
On July 31, 2020, CMS issued a final rule outlining Medicare payment rates for skilled nursing facilities for federal fiscal year 2021. Effective October 1, 2020, payments to SNFs are estimated to increase by 2.2% based on a market basket percentage update of 2.2%, adjusted by a 0.0 percentage point multifactor productivity adjustment.
The payment rates described above are reduced pursuant to ongoing sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. CMS began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims in April 2013. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") and related legislation suspends the Medicare sequestration payment adjustment from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 (but extend sequestration through 2030). 
CMS has implemented policies intended to shift Medicare to value-based payment methodologies, tying reimbursement to quality of care rather than quantity. For example, under the Quality Reporting Program ("QRP"), SNFs are required to report quality data to CMS or be subject to a 2% reduction to the annual market basket update. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS granted an exception to all SNFs, relieving them from data reporting requirements from October 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. In federal fiscal year 2019, the Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (“SNF VBP”) Program began making incentive payments available to skilled nursing centers based on their past performance on a specified quality measure related to hospital readmissions. CMS funds the SNF VPB Program incentive payment pool by withholding 2% of SNF payments and then redistributing some of the withheld payments. Data collected from each performance period affects Medicare payments two years later. CMS announced it would exclude certain measures from SNF VBP performance calculations from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CMS also finalized the SNF VBP's Extraordinary Circumstances Exception Policy, which may relieve facilities from program requirements due to natural disasters or other circumstances beyond the facility's control that may affect the facility's ability to provide quality care. Facilities must apply for the exception and demonstrate that an extraordinary circumstance affected the care provided to their patients. If CMS approves a facility's request, it will exclude the calendar months affected by the extraordinary circumstances from the facility's performance calculations.
CMS publishes rankings based on performance scores on the Care Compare website. Care Compare is a streamlined redesign of eight existing CMS healthcare compare tools, including Nursing Home Compare, which is intended to assist the public in finding and comparing skilled care or other providers. The Care Compare website also publishes for each nursing home a rating between 1 and 5 stars as part of CMS’s Five-Star Quality Rating System. An overall star rating is determined based on three components (information from the last three years of health inspections, staffing information, and quality measures), each of which also has its own five-star rating. The ratings are based, in part, on the quality data nursing centers are required to report. For example, nursing centers must report the rate of short-stay residents who are successfully discharged into the community and the percentage who had an outpatient emergency department visit. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS issued temporary waivers and flexibilities that impact the information posted on the Care Compare website and used in the Five-Star Quality Rating System. For example, CMS temporarily waived the requirement to submit staffing data and issued guidance prioritizing or suspending certain nursing home surveys. Some of these measures have been lifted, while some are subject to phased re-opening criteria. However, due to these changes and their impact on data, CMS adjusted some ratings (e.g., by holding specific quality measures constant) and did not report on certain data to the Quality Rating System, but resumed updating the quality measure data on the Care Compare website and Five-Star Quality Rating System on January 27, 2021. In addition to the standard Nursing Home Compare data, CMS is reporting COVID-19 data submitted by nursing homes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ("CDC") National Healthcare Safety Network and linking to this information from the Care Compare website. The information reported includes the number of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 in each facility, resident deaths related to COVID-19, availability of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing, and potential staffing shortages. 
We remain diligent in continuing to provide outstanding patient care to achieve high rankings for our centers as well as assuring that our rankings are correct and appropriately reflect our quality results. Our focus has been and continues to be on the delivery of quality care to our patients and residents.
Therapy Services. Reimbursement for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services covered under Medicare Part B is determined according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”), which is updated annually. For 2021, CMS updated the conversion factor based on a budget neutrality adjustment of negative 10.20%. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 ("CAA") provides for a 3.75% payment increase under the MPFS, which will partially offset this reduction. If a beneficiary receives multiple therapy treatments in one day, Medicare Part B pays the full rate for the therapy unit of service that has the highest Practice Expense (“PE”) component. A multiple procedure payment reduction is 
applied to the second and subsequent therapy units, reducing reimbursement to 50% of the applicable PE component. Targeted medical reviews are performed when expenses for a beneficiary exceed a threshold of $3,000 for physical and speech therapy services combined or $3,000 for occupational therapy services alone. Deductible and coinsurance amounts paid by the beneficiary for therapy services count toward the amount applied to the limit. Claims above the threshold may be subject to post-payment review of medical necessity documentation by Supplemental Medical Review Contractors.
CMS has implemented value-based programs that affect Medicare payments for physician and other clinician services. Under the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care, physicians and certain other clinicians, including therapists, are required to participate in one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in each performance year affects Medicare payments two years later. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“Advanced APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. A provider with sufficient participation in an Advanced APM is exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the second track, the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”). Providers electing to participate in MIPS receive either payment incentives or are subject to payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of electronic health records. For performance data collected in 2021, CMS will continue to offer the Extreme and Uncontrollable Circumstances Policy. This policy is an exception providers must apply for, which allows reweighting for any or all MIPS performance categories for providers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. MIPS consolidates components of previously established incentive programs, including the Value-Based Payment Modifier program and the Physician Quality Reporting System.
Medicaid 
Medicaid is a medical assistance program for the indigent that is funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. Federal law requires states to cover certain nursing center services for Medicaid-eligible individuals when other payment options are unavailable. However, Medicaid eligibility requirements and benefits vary by state, and states may impose limitations on nursing services. States may also establish levels of service or payment methodologies by acuity or specialization of a nursing center.
The Affordable Care Act requires states to expand Medicaid coverage by adjusting eligibility requirements such as income thresholds. However, certain members of Congress continue to attempt to repeal or significantly modify the Affordable Care Act, which may result in changes to Medicaid. Further, states may opt out of the Medicaid expansion. Some states use or have applied to use waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. CMS administrators have indicated that they intend to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs. However, President Biden has issued an executive order directing agencies to re-examine measures that reduce coverage or undermine Medicaid programs, including work requirements.
Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a skilled nursing center’s cost of caring for patients. Some states make supplemental payments to Medicaid providers beyond the base payment for specific claims. Upper payment level (“UPL”) supplemental payments are intended to address the difference between Medicaid fee-for-service payments and Medicare reimbursement rates. The CAA requires the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") to develop a system for states to report supplemental payments data by October 2021 and publish such data on CMS's website. CMS is also considering making additional changes affecting supplemental payments. The Company receives supplemental payments, including through Indiana's UPL program, which provides supplemental Medicaid payments for skilled nursing centers that are licensed to non-state government entities such as county hospital districts. One skilled nursing center previously operated by the Company entered into a transaction with one such hospital district participating in the UPL program, providing for the transfer of the license from the Company to the hospital district. The Company’s operating subsidiary retained the management of the center on behalf of the hospital district. The agreement between the hospital district and the Company is terminable by either party.
We receive the majority of our annual Medicaid rate increases during the third quarter of each year. The rate changes received in 2020 and 2019, along with increased Medicaid acuity in our acuity based states, were the primary contributor to our 1.7% increase in average rate per day for Medicaid patients in 2020 compared to 2019. Based on the rate changes received during the third quarter of 2020, we expect a favorable impact to our rate per day for Medicaid patients as we move into 2021 due to modest rate increases in many of the states in which we operate.
Several states in which we operate face budget shortfalls, which could result in reductions in Medicaid funding for nursing centers. Pressures on state budgets are expected to continue in the future. Certain of the states in which we operate are actively seeking ways to reduce Medicaid spending for nursing center care by such methods as capitated payments and substantial reductions in reimbursement rates. In addition, enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years as states seek to manage costs, utilization, and quality. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with private entities for the delivery of Medicaid health benefits and to handle program responsibilities like care management and claims adjudication. 
Some states and managed care plans are promoting alternatives to nursing center care, such as community and home-based services.
Legislation and administrative actions at the federal and state levels may significantly alter the funding for, or structure of, Medicaid programs. CMS administrators have also signaled interest in changing Medicaid payment models, including through increased use of value-based care models. We are unable to predict what, if any, reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be implemented in the future, or the effect such changes would have on our operations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived 19.8% and 45.6% of our total patient revenues related to continuing operations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, respectively.  Any health care reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under these programs could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability. 
Employees.
As of March 1, 2021, we employed approximately 4,800 employees, referred to as "team members," in connection with our continuing operations, approximately 2,700 of which are considered full-time team members. Approximately 600 of our team members are represented by a labor union. We believe that we staff appropriately, focusing primarily on the acuity level and day-to-day needs of our patients and residents. In most states where we operate, our skilled nursing facilities are subject to state mandated minimum staffing ratios, so our ability to reduce costs by decreasing staffing, notwithstanding decreases in acuity or need, is limited and subject to government audits and penalties in some states. We seek to manage our labor costs by improving team member retention, improving operating efficiencies, maintaining competitive benefits and reducing reliance on overtime compensation and temporary nursing agency services. We believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified professional team members stems from our ability to offer attractive benefit packages, a high level of employee training, and a culture that provides incentives for a quality work environment.
Although we believe we are able to employ sufficient clinical personnel to provide our services, a shortage of health care professional personnel in any of the geographic areas in which we operate could affect our ability to recruit and retain qualified team members and could increase our operating costs. Such shortages may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We compete with other health care providers for both professional and non-professional team members and with non-health care providers for non-professional team members. This competition continues to contribute to a consistent increase in the salaries that we have to pay to hire and retain these team members. As is common in the health care industry, we expect the salary and wage increases for our skilled healthcare providers will continue to be higher than average salary and wage increases nationally.
Supplies and Equipment.
We purchase drugs, solutions and other materials and lease certain equipment required in connection with our business from many suppliers. We may experience supply chain disruptions, including delays and price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals, and medical supplies. We have incurred additional expenditures preparing our centers for potential outbreaks of COVID-19 and providing care to our residents during required or recommended periods of isolation as a result of increased demand and supply chain constraints. National purchasing contracts are in place for all major supplies, such as food, linens and medical supplies. These contracts assist in maintaining quality, consistency and efficient pricing. Based on contract pricing for food and other supplies, we expect cost increases in 2021 to be relatively the same as we experienced in 2020. 
Government Regulation.
The health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government health care program participation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, quality of patient care and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Over the last several years, government activity has increased with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations by health care providers of a number of statutes and regulations, including those regulating fraud and abuse, false claims, patient privacy and quality of care issues. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in exclusion from government health care programs together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services previously billed. Compliance with such laws and regulations is subject to ongoing government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions in which government agencies seek to impose fines and penalties. The Company is involved in regulatory actions of this type from time to time.
Licensure and Certification.
All our nursing centers must be licensed by the state in which they are located in order to accept patients, regardless of payor source. In most states, nursing centers are subject to CON laws, which require us to obtain government approval for the construction of new nursing centers or the addition of new licensed beds to existing centers. Our nursing centers must comply with detailed statutory and regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis in order to qualify for licensure, as well as for certification as a provider eligible to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Generally, the requirements for licensure and Medicare/Medicaid certification are similar and relate to quality and adequacy of personnel, quality and necessity of medical care, record keeping, dietary services, patient rights, the physical condition of the nursing center, and the 
adequacy of equipment used in the nursing center. In response to COVID-19, CMS has issued additional requirements for long-term care facilities, including requirements to test facility staff and residents for COVID-19 and report COVID-19 data to the CDC. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
In 2016, CMS published a comprehensive update to the health and safety standards applicable to long-term care facilities participating in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. These revisions are aimed at improving quality of life, care, and services in long-term care facilities, optimizing resident safety, and reflecting current professional standards. For example, CMS added requirements related to infection prevention and control, compliance and ethics programs, staff training, and QAPI. We believe we have achieved substantial compliance with these requirements. In April 2019, CMS announced a comprehensive overview of regulations, guidelines, and processes related to safety and quality in nursing homes, including plans to enhance enforcement efforts and increase transparency through the Nursing Home Compare website, which transitioned to the new Care Compare website in September 2020. It is unclear how related initiatives will affect our operations. 
Each of our centers is subject to periodic inspections, known as “surveys” by health care regulators, to determine compliance with all applicable licensure and certification standards. Such requirements are both subjective and subject to change. If a survey concludes that there are deficiencies in compliance, the center will be subject to various sanctions, including but not limited to monetary fines and penalties, suspension of new admissions, non-payment for new admissions and loss of licensure or certification. Generally, however, once a center receives written notice of any compliance deficiencies, it may submit a written plan of correction and is given a reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiencies. In March 2020, certain nursing home surveys were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CMS issued guidance instructing state survey agencies to resume survey activities as soon as they have resources to do so. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such licenses and certifications for our centers in the future or that we will not be required to expend significant sums in order to comply with regulatory requirements.
Health care and health insurance reform.
In recent years, the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures have considered and enacted significant legislation concerning health care and health insurance. The most prominent of these efforts, the Affordable Care Act, affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed. The Affordable Care Act expands coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector reforms, provides for reduced growth in Medicare program spending, and promotes initiatives that tie reimbursement to quality and care coordination. Some of the provisions, such as the requirement that large employers provide health insurance benefits to full-time employees, have increased our operating expenses. The Affordable Care Act expands the role of home-based and community services, which may place downward pressure on our sustaining population of Medicaid patients. Reforms that we believe have had, or may have in the future, a material impact on the long-term care industry and on our business include, among others, bundling of payments to cover both acute and post-acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers. However, significant regulatory and statutory changes have been made to the statute, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. For example, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Certain members of Congress have stated their desire to repeal or make additional significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or interpretation. Effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate. As a result of this change, a federal judge in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and determined that the rest of the Affordable Care Act was, therefore, invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision with respect to the individual mandate, but remanded for further consideration of how this affects the rest of the law. On November 10, 2020, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding this case, and the law remains in place pending the appeals process. The impact of the 2020 federal election on health reform is not yet known, although President Biden has indicated through executive orders that his administration intends to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid programs.
Skilled nursing centers are required to bill Medicare on a consolidated basis for certain items and services that they furnish to patients, regardless of the cost to deliver these services. This consolidated billing requirement essentially makes the skilled nursing center responsible for billing Medicare for all care services delivered to the patient during the length of stay. CMS has instituted a number of test programs designed to extend the reimbursement and financial responsibilities under consolidated billing beyond the traditional discharge date to include a broader set of bundled services. Such examples may include, but are not exclusive to, home health, durable medical equipment, home and community based services, and the cost of re-hospitalizations during a specified bundled period. Currently, these test programs for bundled reimbursement are confined to a small set of clinical conditions, but CMS has indicated that it is developing additional bundled payment models. This bundled form of reimbursement could be extended to a broader range of diagnosis related conditions in the future. The potential impact on skilled nursing center utilization and reimbursement is currently unknown. The process for defining bundled services has not 
been fully determined by CMS and, therefore, is subject to change during the rule making process. CMS has indicated that it is working toward a unified payment system for post-acute care services, including those provided by skilled nursing centers.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and other Privacy and Security Requirements and Data Exchange Requirements.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) has mandated an extensive set of regulations to standardize electronic patient health, administrative and financial data transactions and to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information (“protected health information”). We have a HIPAA compliance committee and designated privacy and security officers.
The HIPAA transaction standards are intended to simplify the electronic claims process and other healthcare transactions by encouraging electronic transmission rather than paper submission. These regulations provide for uniform standards for data reporting, formatting and coding that we must use in certain transactions with health plans. The HIPAA security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. Some of the security regulations are technical in nature, while others are addressed through policies and procedures.
The HIPAA privacy regulations establish limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information, provide for patients' rights, including rights to access, to request amendment of, and to receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information, and require certain safeguards for protected health information. In addition, each covered entity must contractually bind individuals and entities that furnish services to the covered entity or perform a function on its behalf, and to which the covered entity discloses protected health information, to restrictions on the use and disclosure of that protected health information. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 calendar days from the discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made to the Department of Health and Human Services and, in certain cases involving large breaches, to the media. 
There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. We are subject to any federal and state laws that are more stringent or grant greater privacy rights to individuals. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. 
Health care providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. For example, beginning April 5, 2021, health care providers and certain other entities will be subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act that prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other disincentives.
Although we believe that we are in material compliance with the HIPAA regulations and other federal and state laws and regulations related to privacy and security, inadvertent violations may occur in the course of our business. For this and other reasons, the HIPAA regulations and other federal and state laws are expected to continue to impact us operationally and financially and may pose increased regulatory risk.
Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Requirements.
The health care industry is subject to state and federal laws that regulate the relationships of providers of health care services, physicians and other clinicians. These restrictions include self-referral laws that impose restrictions on physician referrals to any entity with which they have a financial relationship, which is a broadly defined term. We believe our relationships with physicians comply with the self-referral laws. Failure to comply with self-referral laws could subject us to a range of sanctions, including civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from government reimbursement programs. There are also federal and state laws making it illegal to offer anyone anything of value in return for referral of patients. These laws, generally known as “anti-kickback” laws, are broad and subject to interpretations that are highly fact dependent. Given the lack of clarity of these laws, there can be no absolute assurance that any health care provider, including us, will not be found in violation of the anti-kickback laws in any given factual situation. Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties, may be imposed for violation of the anti-kickback laws. From time to time, the government issues regulations and guidance that interpret these laws, including final rules issued in November 2020, that are intended to modernize and clarify the federal self-referral and anti-kickback statutes.
False Claims Act and Billing Compliance.
There are a number of laws and regulations that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid that, if not followed, can result in payment denials, significant fines, or criminal liability. Among the more serious of these laws, is the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), pursuant to which actions may be brought against a provider by the federal government or by a private party on behalf of the federal government, known as a “qui tam relators” or “relators,” for the submission of false claims for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid. These actions can lead to significant civil monetary 
penalties, significant criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in state and federally-funded healthcare programs. Relators are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government under the FCA. Both direct enforcement activity by the government and qui tam relator actions have increased significantly in recent years. 
The basis of an FCA violation can include issues such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, billing for unnecessary services, or submitting false cost reports. Liability also arises for the known failure to report and refund an overpayment received from the government within 60 days of identifying such overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment. Some courts have held that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as self-referral or kickback laws, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. Allegations of poor quality of care can also lead to FCA actions under a theory of worthless services, which contends that care provided was so deficient that it was tantamount to no service at all. 
A violation of the FCA also occurs when a provider’s request for payment falsely certifies compliance with the applicable statutes (including self-referral or kickback laws), regulations or contract provisions that are preconditions to payment. The recognition of this theory has increased the risk that a healthcare company will have to defend an FCA action, pay fines and treble damages or settlement amounts or be excluded from federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of the FCA.
Secondary Coverage Reporting Obligations.
As required by the Medicare Secondary Reporting Act and related laws and regulations, we report to CMS specific information regarding all claimants and claim settlements involving Medicare participants so CMS can recover Medicare funds expended to provide healthcare treatment to the claimant. The requirements are to ensure that CMS is notified so that it may recoup the amounts paid for services from the settlement proceeds. The requirements do not result in us making additional payments to CMS for these services provided and does not result in an incremental cost to us. Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties, may be imposed for non-compliance with these reporting obligations.
