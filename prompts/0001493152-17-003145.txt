Item 1. Business 
 
Since its formation in 1987, the Company has engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative pharmaceuticals for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In 2011, however, we conducted a re-evaluation of our strategic focus and determined that clinical development in the area of respiratory disorders, particularly sleep apneas and respiratory depression produced by drugs and neural damage, provided the most cost-effective opportunities for potential rapid development and commercialization of our compounds. As a result of our scientific discoveries and the acquisition of strategic, exclusive license agreements, we believe we are now a leader in the discovery and development of innovative pharmaceuticals for the treatment of respiratory disorders.
 
Saying that there exists an unmet need for new drug treatments for breathing disorders is an understatement. According to a study commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, published in August 2016 (“AASM Commissioned Study”), there are approximately 29.4 million adults with obstructive sleep apnea, of which 5.9 million are diagnosed. Sleep apnea places a considerable burden on society and the health care system because of its association with co-morbidities and adverse events ranging from loss of productivity to increased risk of cardiopulmonary illness and related death. According to the AASM Commissioned Study, the estimated overall cost of obstructive sleep apnea in the United States in 2015 was $162 billion, of which $12.4 billion relates to the diagnosed/treated population and the balance to the undiagnosed population. No drugs currently are approved for the treatment of sleep apnea.
 
Even in patients without sleep apneas, the use of drugs such as propofol, used as an anesthetic during surgery, and opioid analgesics such as morphine and oxycodone, used during anesthesia and for the treatment of post-surgical and chronic pain, are well known for producing respiratory depression. In fact, while respiratory depression is the leading cause of death from the overdose of most classes of abused drugs, it also arises during normal, physician-supervised procedures such as surgical anesthesia, post-operative analgesia and as a result of normal outpatient management of pain.
 
Although opioid antagonists such as naloxone (Narcan) and nalmefene (Revex) can reverse respiratory depression associated with opioids, they have several major shortcomings. First and foremost, these opioid antagonists do not reverse the respiratory depression produced by other classes of drugs often given/taken either alone or in combination with opioids. Second, while these drugs reverse the serious side effects of the opioids, they also dramatically reduce their analgesic effectiveness. Third, the side effects of opioid antagonists are themselves serious and include seizures, agitation, convulsions, tachycardia, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting.
 
Furthermore, respiratory depression can arise as a result of a number of other illnesses that involve neural and muscular disorders. For example, certain spinal injuries can interfere with normal neural communication between the brain and the lungs resulting in reduced respiratory capacity. Pompe Disease is an autosomal, recessive, metabolic disorder that damages muscle and nerve cells throughout the body. One of the first symptoms is a progressive decrease in the strength of muscles such as the diaphragm and other muscles required for breathing and respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. In both of these indications, symptomatic treatment for the respiratory depression is severely lacking. 
 
Accordingly, there is a considerable need for pharmaco-therapeutic agents to (i) treat sleep apnea, (ii) prevent and reverse the respiratory depression produced by different classes of drugs, and (iii) relieve the respiratory depression produced in a number of neurological indications, such as Pompe Disease and spinal injury. The Company currently has two drug platforms, each with a clinical stage compound directed at these needs.
 
Sleep Apnea
 
Sleep apnea is a serious disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops long enough to disrupt sleep, and temporarily decreases the amount of oxygen and increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. Apnea is defined by more than five periods per hour of ten seconds or longer without breathing. The repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep has substantial impact on the affected individuals. The disorder is associated with major co-morbidities including excessive daytime sleepiness and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (such as hypertension, stroke and heart failure), diabetes and weight gain. Sleep apnea is often made worse by central nervous system depressants such as opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol. It is therefore important for these patients to seek therapy.

The most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”), which occurs by narrowing or collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. There is currently no approved pharmacotherapy, and the most common treatment is to use continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”) delivered via a nasal or full-face mask, as long as patients are able to tolerate the treatment. We believe that patient compliance with CPAP devices is extremely low. Alternative treatments include surgical intervention, dental appliances, hypoglossal nerve stimulation (via surgical implant) and other physical interventions. Given the large patient population and a lack of suitable treatment options, there is a very large opportunity for pharmacotherapy to treat this disorder.
 
Central sleep apnea (“CSA”), a less frequently diagnosed type of sleep apnea, is caused by alterations in the brain mechanisms responsible for maintaining normal respiratory drive. CSA is most frequently observed in patients taking chronic opioids and in heart failure patients, and is a major correlate for mortality in these patients. There are no therapeutic options for patients with CSA; CPAP is contra-indicated for the treatment of CSA and no drugs are currently approved for this indication.
 
In addition, many patients present with a pattern of sleep apnea that has both obstructive and central components.
 
Drug-induced Respiratory Depression
 
Drug-induced respiratory depression (“RD”) is a life-threatening condition caused by a variety of depressant drugs, including analgesic, hypnotic, and anesthesia medications. We believe that RD is a leading cause of death from the overdose of some classes of abused drugs, yet it also arises during normal, physician-supervised procedures such as surgical anesthesia and post-operative pain management. For example, in the hospital setting, anesthetics such as propofol are well known for their propensity to produce RD, particularly when combined with opioids. According to data from the National Center for Health Statistics, 48 million surgical inpatient procedures were performed in the United States in 2009. It is notable that, according to the HealthGrades Inc. Patient Safety in American Hospitals Study released in 2011, post-operative respiratory failure produces the third highest number of patient safety events, the fourth highest mortality rate, and the second largest overall excess cost to the Medicare system, when compared to other patient safety indicators. The Company believes that, in these patients, the major risk factor for the appearance of RD is a history of sleep apnea.
 
In the hospital setting, one of the most serious complications of patient-controlled analgesia is RD and, despite nurses’ vigilance, adverse events associated with opioids continue to increase. Drug-induced RD is associated with a high mortality rate relative to other adverse drug events. In post-surgical patients taking opioids for pain management, sleep apnea is a major risk factor for the occurrence of RD. If patients with sleep apnea are receiving combination therapies, they are at even higher risk for complications and extended hospital stays.
 
Outside the hospital, the primary risk factor for RD is the use of a single opioid in large doses or concomitant use of opioids and sedative agents. Whether due to normal outpatient pain management, or as a result of substance abuse, RD has been reported to be the leading cause of death from drug overdose, with the drug overdose death rate tripling since 1991. In patients chronically consuming opioids, CSA is a major correlate for overdose and most likely represents an early and sensitive form of opioid induced RD. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that approximately 15,000 people die every year as a result of overdoses involving prescription painkillers. Oxycodone and fentanyl have been reported to be the two most frequently reported drugs associated with death and serious nonfatal outcomes from 1998 to 2005, exceeding the number of deaths from heroin and cocaine combined. Opioid use has increased significantly along with a dramatic increase in unintentional poisoning deaths from opioids. Unintentional deaths from opioids are not only related to diversion for nonmedical use and misuse by patients, but by prescriber’s error as well.

Drug Abuse
 
On January 19, 2016, the Company announced that that it had reached an agreement with the Medications Development Program of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) to conduct research on the Company’s ampakine compounds CX717 and CX1739. The agreement was entered into as of October 19, 2015, and on January 14, 2016, the Company and NIDA approved the proposed protocols, allowing research activities to commence. NIDA is evaluating the compounds using pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic and toxicologic protocols to determine the potential effectiveness of the ampakines for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction. The Company retains all intellectual property as well as proprietary and commercialization rights to the Company’s compounds. Initial studies focus on cocaine and methamphetamine addiction and abuse, and are contracted to outside testing facilities and/or government laboratories, with all costs paid by NIDA. In experiments conducted by NIDA, CX717 antagonized the stimulatory effects of methamphetamine. NIDA is in the process of testing CX717 on the interoceptive effects (determinants of additions liability) of both cocaine and methamphetamine in models of drug discrimination in rats.
Cannabinoids
 
In order to expand the Company’s respiratory disorders program, on August 10, 2012, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Pier Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Pier”), a privately-held Delaware corporation, Pier Acquisition Corp. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company, Merger Sub merged with and into Pier (the “Merger”) and Pier became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Pier had been formed in June 2007 (under the name SteadySleep Rx Co.) as a clinical stage pharmaceutical company to develop a pharmacologic treatment for OSA and had been engaged in research and clinical development activities since formation.
 
Through the Merger, the Company gained access to an Exclusive License Agreement, as amended (the “Old License Agreement”), that Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The Old License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. Dronabinol is a synthetic derivative of the naturally occurring substance in the cannabis plant, otherwise known as Δ9-THC (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Dronabinol is currently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and is sold generically for use in refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, as well as for anorexia in patients with AIDS.
 
The Old License Agreement was terminated on March 21, 2013 due to the Company’s failure to make a required payment. However, on June 27, 2014, the Company entered into a new license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (the “2014 License Agreement”). In exchange for certain milestone and royalty payments, patent costs and license fees, the 2014 License Agreement grants the Company: (i) exclusive rights to several issued and pending patents, and (ii) the non-exclusive right to certain technical information that is generated by the University of Illinois in connection with certain clinical trials as specified in the 2014 License Agreement, all of which relate to the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders. The Company is developing dronabinol for the treatment of OSA, the most common form of sleep apnea.
 
Prior to the merger, the Company conducted a 21 day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase 2 clinical study in 22 patients with OSA, in which dronabinol produced a statistically significant reduction in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), the primary therapeutic end-point, and was observed to be safe and well tolerated.
 
On December 23, 2016, the Company announced positive results of the potentially pivotal, PACE (Pharmacotherapy of Apnea by Cannabimimetic Enhancement) Phase 2B OSA clinical trial, that was fully funded by the National Institutes of Health and conducted by Dr. David Carley and colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University. In the PACE trial, dronabinol significantly improved the primary outcome measures of Apnea Hypopnea Index (“AHI”), daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (“ESS”), and overall patient satisfaction as measured by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medications (“TSQM”). 
 
In a dose dependent fashion, treatment with 2.5 mg and 10 mg dronabinol once a day at night significantly reduced the Apnea Hypopnea Index (“AHI”), a measure of breathing abnormalities during sleep, in 56 patients with moderate to severe OSA who completed the study. Of these, 17 received placebo, 19 received the 2.5 mg dose and 20 received the 10 mg dose. Compared to average baseline AHI values of 26 + 12, six weeks of dronabinol administration to moderate to severe OSA patients reduced AHI values, compared to placebo, by 9.7 + 4 for the 2.5 mg dose and 13.2 + 4 for the 10 mg dose (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001, respectively, compared to control). Furthermore, treatment with 10 mg dronabinol significantly improved daytime sleepiness as measured by the ESS (p = 0.0001, compared to placebo) and achieved the greatest overall patient satisfaction with treatment (p = 0.02) as measured by the TSQM.

Dronabinol is a Schedule III, controlled generic drug with a relatively low abuse potential that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of AIDS related anorexia and chemotherapy induced emesis. The use of dronabinol for the treatment of OSA is a novel indication for an already approved drug and, as such, the Company expects that FDA approval of a 505(b)(2) application will be required.
 
Ampakines
 
Since its founding, the Company has been engaged in the research and clinical development of a class of compounds referred to as ampakines. By acting as positive allosteric modulators of AMPA glutamate receptors, ampakines increase the excitatory effects of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Early preclinical and clinical research suggested that these ampakines might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of memory and cognitive disorders, depression, attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia. Given our current focus on respiratory disorders, we may seek to partner, out-license or sell our rights to the use of ampakine compounds for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric indications, as we focus on the development of our compounds for the treatment of breathing disorders.
 
The early ampakines discovered by the Company, Eli Lilly and Company, and others were ultimately abandoned due to the presence of undesirable side effects, particularly convulsive activity. Subsequently, Company scientists discovered a new, chemically distinct series of molecules termed “low impact” as opposed to the “high impact” designation given to the earlier compounds. While these low impact compounds share many pharmacological properties with the high impact compounds, they do not produce convulsive effects in animals. These low impact compounds do not bind to the same molecular site as the high impact compounds and, as a result, do not produce the undesirable electrophysiological and biochemical effects that lead to convulsive activity.
 
The Company owns patents and patent applications for certain families of chemical compounds that claim the chemical structures, their actions as ampakines and their use in the treatment of various disorders. Patents claiming a family of chemical structures, including CX1739 and CX1942, as well as their use in the treatment of various disorders, extend through at least 2028. Additional patents claiming a family of chemical structures, including CX717, as well as their use in the treatment of various disorders, expire in 2017 in the U.S. and in 2018 internationally.
 
In order to broaden the use of the Company’s ampakine technology into the area of respiratory disorders, on May 8, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting the Company exclusive rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment of various respiratory disorders, including drug induced respiratory depression. These patents extend through at least 2028 and, along with the Company’s own patents claiming chemical structures, comprise the Company’s principal intellectual property supporting the Company’s research and clinical development program in the use of ampakines for the treatment of respiratory disorders.
 
The Company has obtained preclinical results indicating that several of its low impact ampakines, including CX717, CX1739 and CX1942, were able to antagonize the respiratory depression caused by opioids, barbiturates and anesthetics without offsetting the analgesic effects of the opioid or the sedative effects of the anesthetics. Dr. John Greer, faculty member of the Department of Physiology, Perinatal Research Centre, and Women & Children’s Health Research Institute and Alberta Innovates Health Sciences Senior Scientist with the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute at the University of Alberta, has shown that these ampakine effects are due to a direct action on neurons in pre-Botzinger’s complex, a brain stem region responsible for regulating respiratory drive.
 
After several Phase 1 and 2 studies to demonstrate safety and tolerability, the first of these low impact compounds, CX717, was tested in two Phase 2A clinical studies to determine its ability to antagonize the respiratory depressant effects of fentanyl, a potent opioid analgesic. In both of these studies, one of which was published in a peer-reviewed journal, CX717 antagonized the respiratory depression produced by fentanyl without altering the analgesia produced by this drug.

Despite the impending loss in 2017 and 2018, respectively, of U.S. patents and international patents claiming composition-of-matter and certain non-respiratory uses for CX717, the Company believes that CX717 stills retains considerable value as a potential, commercial product, for the following reasons. The Company owns or controls patents claiming the use of CX717 for the treatment of various respiratory disorders that are in effect in the United States and elsewhere at least through 2028, and additional method of treatment patents are planned and are being prepared. Long term preclinical safety studies have been completed and are sufficient to support chronic dosing of CX717 in humans for six months. In nine Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies, CX717 was safe and well tolerated. CX717 has demonstrated the ability to antagonize the respiratory effects of fentanyl, a potent opioid, in two clinical trials, demonstrating target site engagement as well as proof of principle. Promising results also have been observed in clinical trials of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and cognition. Finally, while CX717 was put on temporary clinical hold by the FDA due to potential neurotoxicity, this hold was completely removed and the Company was allowed to re-initiate clinical trials. This lifting of the clinical hold resulted from the Company obtaining what it believes to be conclusive data showing that the presumed neurotoxicity (i.e., appearance of vacuoles in certain brain regions) observed after administration of very high doses of CX717 results from a post-mortem artifact due to the interaction of CX717 with formaldehyde, the chemical agent used to fix the brain tissue. The Company is preparing this data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and intends to submit a new Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to the FDA in the second half of 2017.
 
In several Phase 1 clinical studies, the Company’s present lead ampakine, CX1739, has demonstrated good safety and tolerability after single doses up to 1200 mg for seven days, as well as two doses per day of 600 mg each for ten days. Pharmacokinetic results to date from the volunteers who have taken CX1739 show that drug absorption over the range of 50 mg to 1200 mg was linear and predictable, with an approximate half-life of 8 hours.
 
The Company filed an IND with the FDA in September 2015 to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, Phase 2A study of CX1739 (300 mg) versus placebo, followed by dose escalation of CX1739 to 600 and 900 mg, with open-label administration of the IV opioid remifentanil in approximately 18 healthy subjects to assess the ability of CX1739 to antagonize the respiratory depressive effect of remifentanil without altering the analgesic effect of the opioid. The clinical protocol was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CX1739 to antagonize respiratory depression in two models of opioid use and abuse. During REMI-INFUSION, a model of chronic (steady state) opioid use, respiration, pain, pulmometry, and safety were measured during a 30-minute intravenous infusion of remifentanil that produced stable blood levels. During REMI-BOLUS, a model of acute, intravenous opioid overdose, a single, intravenous bolus injection of remifentanil was administered at a dose calculated to achieve significant respiratory depression.
 
On each study day, REMI-BOLUS was initiated with an intravenous, bolus injection of remifentanil 3 hours after subjects received either placebo or CX1739. Respiration was measured for 20 minutes and then compared to the baseline respiration recorded 5 minutes prior to the bolus injection. REMI-INFUSION was initiated 3.5 hours after placebo or CX1739, with an intravenous infusion protocol designed to maintain stable remifentanil blood levels and calculated to produce approximately 50% respiratory depression. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT02735629.
 
The commencement of this clinical trial was subject to the resolution of two deficiencies raised by the FDA in its clinical hold letter issued in November 2015, which were satisfactorily resolved in early 2016. As a result, the FDA removed the clinical hold on the Company’s IND for CX1739 on February 25, 2016, thus allowing for the initiation of the clinical trial. In March 2016, upon Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval, the trial was initiated at the Duke Clinical Research Unit (“DCRU”), Duke University Medical Center (“DUMC”), Durham NC. The dosing and data acquisition phase of the clinical trial was completed in June 2016 and the clinical trial was formally completed on July 11, 2016.
 
On September 12, 2016, the Company announced preliminary top-line analysis of safety and efficacy data from this clinical trial. On October 3, 2016, the Company discovered an error in the preliminary data reported to it and accordingly, on October 4, 2016, the Company issued a press release retracting the efficacy data contained in the September 12, 2016 press release. On December 15, 2016, the Company announced the corrected results of the trial, and presented the re-analyzed data, as follows.

During REMI-INFUSION, the model of chronic opioid use, CX1739 antagonized the respiratory rate depression produced by remifentanil, with statistically significant effects observed at 300 mg (p<.005) and 900 mg (p<.001). The antagonism produced by the 600 mg dose did not achieve statistical significance. This lack of a linear, dose response effect is not unusual in early stage clinical trials. During this period, CX1739 did not alter the analgesic and sedative effects of remifentanil. During REMI-BOLUS, the model of IV opioid overdose, CX1739 treatment did not prevent respiratory depression, or improve time to recovery at any of the doses tested.
 
Overall, CX1739 was found to be safe and well tolerated, both prior to and during administration of remifentanil. Treatment-related adverse events (“AEs”) for the various doses of CX1739 were mild, with an incidence comparable to that reported for placebo. The great majority of AEs occurred after remifentanil administration, including nausea and vomiting, which are common side effects associated with opioid administration.
 
In addition to CX1739, the Company is developing CX1942, a soluble ampakine, as an injectable formulation in a hospital or surgical setting to be used in conjunction with opioids and anesthetics either during or after surgery. Animal studies conducted in collaboration with investigators at the University of Florida and funded by a Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) contract from the National Institute of Drug Abuse have indicated that CX1942 injected intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously can reverse the respiratory depression produced by fentanyl. Such data will be used to develop an injectable formulation with the flexibility to be administered via different routes.
 
As part of its preclinical research program, the Company, through Dr. John Greer, Chairman of the RespireRx Scientific Advisory Board, has engaged in research collaborations with a number of academic institutions. As part of its collaborative program with Dr. David Fuller of the University of Florida, studies with RespireRx’s ampakines have determined that these compounds improve breathing in animal models of spinal cord injury and Pompe Disease. Based on these encouraging preclinical results, the Company has begun planning, in conjunction with the Miami Project at the University of Miami and the University of Florida, to conduct clinical trials investigating the ability of CX717 and/or CX1739 to improve breathing in patients with spinal cord injury.
 
Development Goals
 
To achieve our short-and long-term development goals, as well as to provide for our day-to-day operations, we will need additional capital, the availability of which is subject to uncertainly. Should sufficient financing be available, the Company’s short-term development goals consist of the following:

1. | Upon issuance of the final clinical report of the PACE dronabinol study, the Company intends to have a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in order to identify a Phase 3 plan for the commercial development of dronabinol for the treatment of OSA, which also may include the entering into a Special Protocol Assessment, a request for fast-track status and/or a request for breakthrough status. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The Company intends to have a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in order to initiate a multi-center clinical trial investigating the ability of CX717 and/or CX1739 to improve breathing in patients with spinal cord injury. Assuming, and upon, FDA allowance and appropriate approvals by institutional review boards, we intend to have this study conducted at the University of Miami, the University of Florida, the Detroit Medical Center and the Detroit Veterans Administration Hospital. 
3. | Upon issuance of the final clinical report of the CX1739 Phase 2A trial, the Company intends to seek FDA allowance to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of CX1739 in patients who are on a chronic opioid regimen. 

 
The Company believes that these goals can be achieved in a timely and cost-effective manner. To meaningfully advance any of the above goals, however, the Company must secure sufficient additional financing. No assurance can be provided that sufficient financing will be obtained.
 
The Company’s longer term goals include the execution of a Phase 3 clinical trial program for dronabinol for OSA and the initiation of the Phase 2 clinical trial to determine the safety of CX1739 and its ability reduce symptoms of respiratory depression in patients who are on a chronic opioid regimen. Currently, the Company does not have sufficient financing resources to pursue these long term goals, and can provide no assurance that available sources of financing or a strategic partner will be secured to enable the Company to pursue or achieve these goals.

Our ability to meet our short- and long-term goals will depend on our ability to secure financing or a strategic partner. The Company believes that successful commercial implementation of these goals will require strategic partnership, which is not currently in place and for which no assurance can be provided.
 
See Item 1A, Risk Factors, “We will need additional capital in the near term and the future and, if such capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or available to us at all, we may need to scale back our research and development efforts and may be unable to continue our business operations.”
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research efforts, rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. Our competitors include many companies, research institutes and universities that are working in a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology disciplines to develop therapeutic products similar to those we are currently investigating. Most of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and/or other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have experience in performing human clinical trials of new or improved therapeutic products and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We have no experience in conducting and managing later-stage clinical testing or in preparing applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals. We expect that competition in this field will continue to intensify.
Regulation
 
The FDA and other similar agencies in foreign countries have substantial requirements for therapeutic products. Such requirements often involve lengthy and detailed laboratory, clinical and post-clinical testing procedures and are expensive to complete. It often takes companies many years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. The review process is also extensive, which may delay the approval process further. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 
FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including the new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Other similar agencies in foreign countries also impose substantial requirements.
 
The process of developing drug candidates normally begins with a discovery process of potential candidates that are then initially tested in in vitro and in vivo non-human animal (preclinical) studies which include, but are not limited to toxicity and other safety related studies, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion). Once sufficient preclinical data are obtained, a company must submit an IND and receive authorization from the FDA in order to begin clinical trials in the United States. Successful drug candidates then move into human studies that are characterized generally as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Phase 1 studies seeking safety and other data normally utilize healthy volunteers. Phase 2 studies utilize one or more prospective patient populations and are designed to establish safety and preliminary measures of efficacy. Sometimes studies may be referred to as Phase 2A and 2B depending on the size of the patient population. Phase 3 studies are large trials in the targeted patient population, performed in multiple centers, often for longer periods of time and are designed to establish statistically significant efficacy as well as safety in the larger population. Most often the FDA and similar regulatory agencies in other countries require two confirmatory Phase 3 or pivotal studies. Upon completion of both the preclinical and clinical phases, an NDA (New Drug Application) is filed with the FDA or a similar filing is made to the regulatory authority in other countries. NDA filings are extensive and include the data from all prior studies. These filings are reviewed by the FDA and, only if approved, may the company or its partners commence marketing of the new drug in the United States.
 
There also are variations of these procedures. For example, companies seeking approval for new indications for an already approved drug may choose to pursue an abbreviated approval process by filing a Supplementary NDA (SNDA). Another example would be an Abbreviated NDA (ANDA) claiming bio-equivalence to an already approved drug. Other opportunities allow for accelerated review and approval based upon several factors, including potential breakthrough status of the drug or orphan designation (generally, an orphan indication in the United States is one with a patient population of less than 200,000).

As of yet, we have not obtained any approvals to market our products. Further, we cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agency will grant us approval for any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Even if regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market. See “Risk Factors – Risks related to our business.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We have no experience or capability to either manufacture bulk quantities of the new compounds that we develop, or to produce finished dosage forms of the compounds, such as tablets or capsules. We rely, and presently intend to continue to rely, on the manufacturing and quality control expertise of contract manufacturing organizations or current and prospective corporate partners. There is no assurance that we will be able to enter into manufacturing arrangements to produce bulk quantities of our compounds on favorable financial terms. There is, however, substantial availability of both bulk chemical manufacturing and dosage form manufacturing capability throughout the world that we believe we can readily access. See “Risk Factors – Risks related to our business – We are at an early stage of development and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products and technologies” for a discussion of certain risks related to the development and commercialization of our products.
Marketing 
 
We have no experience in the marketing of pharmaceutical products and do not anticipate having the resources to distribute and broadly market any products that we may develop. We will therefore continue to seek commercial development arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for our proposed products for those indications that require significant sales forces to effectively market. In entering into such arrangements, we may seek to retain the right to promote or co-promote products for certain of the orphan drug indications in North America. We believe that there is a significant expertise base for such marketing and sales functions within the pharmaceutical industry and expect that we could recruit such expertise if we choose to directly market a drug. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—We are at an early stage of development and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our products and technologies” for a discussion of certain risks related to the marketing of our products.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016 and as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company employed five people and four people, respectively (all officers), two of whom were full time. The Company also engages certain contractors who provide substantial services to the Company. In February 2017, one employee (officer), the Company’s Chief Financial Officer resigned, and his responsibilities were subsequently assigned to one of the remaining officers.
Technology Rights
 
University of California, Irvine License Agreements
 
The Company entered into a series of license agreements in 1993 and 1998 with the University of California, Irvine (“UCI”) that granted the Company proprietary rights to certain chemical compounds that acted as ampakines and their therapeutic uses. These agreements granted the Company, among other provisions, exclusive rights: (i) to practice certain patents and patent applications, as defined in the license agreement, that were then held by UCI; (ii) to identify, develop, make, have made, import, export, lease, sell, have sold or offer for sale any related licensed products; and (iii) to grant sub-licenses of the rights granted in the license agreements, subject to the provisions of the license agreements. The Company was required, among other terms and conditions, to pay UCI a license fee, royalties, patent costs and certain additional payments.

Under such license agreements, the Company was required to make minimum annual royalty payments of approximately $70,000. The Company was also required to spend a minimum of $250,000 per year to advance the ampakine compounds until the Company began to market an ampakine compound. At December 31, 2012, the Company was not in compliance with its minimum annual payment obligations and believed that this default constituted a termination of the license agreements. On April 15, 2013, the Company received a letter from UCI indicating that the license agreements between UCI and the Company had been terminated due to the Company’s failure to make certain payments required to maintain the agreements. Since the patents covered in these license agreements had begun to expire and the therapeutic uses described in these patents were no longer germane to the Company’s new focus on respiratory disorders, the loss of these license agreements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s current drug development programs. In the opinion of management, the Company has made adequate provision for any liability relating to this matter in its financial statements at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 
University of Alberta License Agreement and Research Agreement
 
On May 8, 2007, the Company entered into a license agreement, as subsequently amended, with the University of Alberta granting the Company exclusive rights to practice patents held by the University of Alberta claiming the use of ampakines for the treatment of various respiratory disorders. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta a licensing fee and a patent issuance fee, which were paid, and prospective payments consisting of a royalty on net sales, sublicense fee payments, maintenance payments and milestone payments. The prospective maintenance payments commence on the enrollment of the first patient into the first Phase 2B clinical trial and increase upon the successful completion of the Phase 2B clinical trial. As the Company does not at this time anticipate scheduling a Phase 2B clinical trial in the near term, no maintenance payments to the University of Alberta are currently due and payable, nor are any expected to be due in the near future.
 
On January 12, 2016, the Company entered into a Research Contract with the University of Alberta in order to test the efficacy of ampakines at a variety of dosage and formulation levels in the potential treatment of Pompé Disease, apnea of prematurity and spinal cord injury, as well as to conduct certain electrophysiological studies to explore the ampakine mechanism of action for central respiratory depression. The Company agreed to pay the University of Alberta total consideration of approximately CAD$146,000 (approximately US$108,000), consisting of approximately CAD$85,000 (approximately US$63,000) of personnel funding in cash in four installments during 2016, to provide approximately CAD$21,000 (approximately US$16,000) in equipment, to pay patent costs of CAD$20,000 (approximately US$15,000), and to underwrite additional budgeted costs of CAD$20,000 (approximately US$15,000). All but approximately US$16,000 of the total consideration has already been paid directly or in-kind. The conversion to U.S. dollars above utilizes an exchange rate of approximately US$0.76 for every CAD$1.00.
 
The University of Alberta has received matching funds through a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in support of the research. The Company retains the rights to research results and any patentable intellectual property generated by the research. Dr. John Greer, Ph.D., Chairman of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board and faculty member of the Department of Physiology, Perinatal Research Centre, and Women & Children’s Health Research Institute and former Director of the Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute at the University of Alberta, collaborated on this research. The studies were completed in 2016. Any patentable intellectual property developed in the Research Agreement will be covered by the existing license agreement described above.
 
University of Illinois License Agreement
 
Through the merger with Pier, the Company gained access to the Old License Agreement that Pier had entered into with the University of Illinois on October 10, 2007. The Old License Agreement covered certain patents and patent applications in the United States and other countries claiming the use of certain compounds referred to as cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders (including sleep apnea), of which dronabinol is a specific example of one type of cannabinoid. The Old License Agreement was terminated effective March 21, 2013 due to the Company’s failure to make a required payment.

On June 27, 2014, the Company entered into the 2014 License Agreement with the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois that was similar, but not identical, to the Old License Agreement. In exchange for certain milestone and royalty payments, patent costs and license fees, the 2014 License Agreement grants the Company (i) exclusive rights to several issued and pending patents, and (ii) the non-exclusive right to certain technical information that is generated by the University of Illinois in connection with certain clinical trials as specified in the 2014 License Agreement, all of which relate to the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of sleep related breathing disorders. The Company is developing dronabinol for the treatment of OSA, the most common form of sleep apnea.
