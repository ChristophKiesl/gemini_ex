 Industry Trends that Drive our Growth
 Annual Increase in Demand for Bandwidth 
 Demand for both downstream and upstream bandwidth from consumers and enterprises has grown substantially and is expected to continue to increase. Key drivers of increased bandwidth demand include: 

• | more users with more connected devices and applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | more time spent online by users;
--+---------------------------------


• | increased use of bandwidth-intensive streaming media services, such as Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Netflix, Hulu and YouTube; cloud applications, such as iCloud, Office 365/OneDrive, and Dropbox; and augmented and virtual reality applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Internet of Things, or IoT, solutions, in connected homes, businesses and industries; connected devices such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant; machine-to-machine connectivity; car connectivity; and smart cities;

Transformation of Communications Network Infrastructure
 To meet the growing demand for utility-grade broadband connectivity, service providers are undertaking a significant transformation in network architecture from the core of the network all the way through to the customer premise equipment. Three key trends are evident in this transformation and, we believe, are important for our growth: densification, network convergence, and cloudification.

• | Densification. Increasing demand for bandwidth and user expectations for ubiquitous, seamless and reliable connectivity require the addition of more access points at the network edge and at customer premises for users to connect to broadband networks, a transformation also known as network densification. As a result, CSPs across all access technologies are shifting from centralized to more distributed architectures. Densification requires extending network connectivity and distributing access aggregation solutions closer to end users. For cable operators this entails deploying more access aggregation nodes and reducing the size of service groups per node. For wireless operators, particularly in 5G, this will lead to an emphasis on small, versus traditional macro, cells in new network deployments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Network Convergence. Traditionally service providers have deployed separate, siloed networks to deliver both fixed (cable, fiber or copper DSL) and mobile broadband to their subscribers. To meet the demands of next generation networks and to realize greater cost efficiencies in network deployment and operation, service providers are focused on converging these siloed fixed and mobile core networks into a single converged 5G core. The 5G core will be the heart of the network and act as an anchor point for multi-access technologies to deliver a seamless service experience across fixed and wireless access technologies. 3GPP, the global wireless standards body, has defined a new 5G core architecture that supports service delivery over wireless, fixed or converged networks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Network virtualization and Cloudification (“Networking as a Service”). Increased consumption of video and other high-bandwidth applications that demand low latency are forcing CSPs to fundamentally rethink their data networks. Network virtualization, in which network software is decoupled from dedicated servers and re-deployed on commodity hardware, was a first step in transforming networks. Virtualization enables several significant benefits to service providers, such as increased operational efficiency, upgradability, configuration flexibility, service agility and scalability. But to meet 5G specifications that call for new or enhanced features, like software-defined networking, multi-access mobile edge computing, and rapid deployment of network slices, additional network architecture modification will be required. We believe that network cloudification is the path forward to solve this challenge, where network functions will be hosted in edge data centers with access delivered through the Internet (public cloud) or via private networks (private cloud). We believe that cloudified networks will provide better support for scalability, agility, innovation, and low latency application and service delivery, as well as the potential for significant cost savings.

 .
 Adoption of 5G
  
• | Fifth Generation, or 5G, Mobile Networks. 5G, the latest generation of cellular technology, is expected to change the way people live and work. 5G will enable a significant increase in the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks due to more available bandwidth and advanced antenna technology. Engineered to provide speeds higher than 2 Gbps, 5G will also offer improved capacity, scale, latency and reliability. In upgrading to 5G, CSPs will require new core and access infrastructure. By 2026, some estimates predict that 60% of the world’s population will be covered by 5G networks, and 5G subscriptions are forecast to grow to 3.5 billion. As a result, we believe that demand from our existing and new customers for our 5G core, access infrastructure and customer premise devices will be an important driver of our growth for the next several years.

• | 5G Fixed Wireless Access, or FWA, likely to become mainstream. A key component of 5G networks will be the promotion of FWA to a more mainstream broadband access medium. FWA services use the mobile network to deliver high-speed fixed broadband connections in areas where there may not be existing high-speed fixed broadband services and where it may not be feasible or cost-effective to deploy other high-speed access technologies such as fixed-line DSL, hybrid fiber coaxial cable, and fiber-to-the-premise. While FWA is not a new broadband technology, until recently the technology was unable to replicate the speed and reliability of fiber broadband. As a result, its deployment was mainly limited to remote communities in under-served rural areas. However, with the introduction of 5G, breakthroughs in FWA technology, and access to millimeter wave spectrum, these technical limitations no longer exist. FWA now has the potential to move from a niche access technology alternative in rural markets to a more mainstream access medium that includes residential suburban and urban markets, as well as enterprise campuses.

Market Opportunity 
 We believe that our products are well suited to address these trends and accordingly present us with a significant market opportunity across all access technologies. Historically, we have generated the significant majority of our revenue from the cable market with our converged cable access platform, or CCAP. However, since 2019 we have become more diversified as a result of our acquisition of NetComm and the introduction of solutions for wireless and fixed-line broadband networks. We believe that this has expanded our total addressable market from approximately $1.2 billion in 2019 to $49.4 billion in 2023.
 We expect to continue to generate revenue in the future from growth in the cable market and increased revenue from sales of both wireless and fixed-line broadband solutions to new and existing customers. We believe there is an opportunity for us to take new market share as fixed and wireless networks continue to converge.
 Key Benefits of Our Solutions
 Highly Flexible, Service-Oriented, Cloud-Native Architecture
 Our multi-service broadband platform, Axyom, is at the heart of all of our core network infrastructure products.  Axyom is a web scale solution based on a distributed micro-service framework. The Axyom Software Platform includes our virtual software workloads and the software that manages those micro-services. The Axyom software architecture includes virtual network functions, or VNFs, for all CSPs – mobile, fixed, cable and converged. Our VNFs are developed from the ground up using cloud native principles to not only ensure scalability and flexibility but to ensure that the Axyom VNFs are optimized for the virtual computing environment in which they will run. 
 Our Axyom software platform offers a large catalogue of ultrabroadband services, while our Axyom Virtual Management Controller, or VMC, provides life-cycle VNF Management, element management system functions and Northbound interfaces to Network Function Virtualization, or NFV, Orchestrators and SDN Controllers. With the ability to support multiple application level KPIs, the VMC provides the control and visibility needed to orchestrate large numbers of VNFs instances running simultaneously and to manage them through their lifecycle. 
 

Each Casa VNF is designed around the following design principles: 
  
• | Supports stateless processing – Axyom VNFs are designed to use a centralized in-memory data store for state and subscriber/session information.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Can be orchestrated – Axyom VNFs have been integrated with several industry leading orchestration solutions, such as NetCracker, HP Enterprise and Amdocs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Composed of microservices – Our microservices operate at web-scale and can be individually managed. They include core microservices that implement business logic and support microservices that support all VNFs. Overall Axyom microservices are designed to be self-contained so that they can be individually upgraded and also chained clustered into VNFs and services. This cloud native approach provides maximum flexibility and operational efficiency
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Supports convergence solutions – Many service providers serve a combination of mobile, fixed and cable broadband subscribers. Our Axyom software platform not only delivers optimized solutions specific to mobile, fixed and cable broadband networks, but Axyom is also designed to support converged solutions. We also provides microservices that can share a common User Plane Function, or UPF, in a multi-access environment, capabilities that provide service providers with common and superior resource management.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Allows location independence – Our core network solutions are disaggregated, allowing control and user plane compute resources to be located in the right place for specific use cases. As an example, if the goal is low latency, Axyom allows the user plane VNF to be located on an edge server.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enables deployment flexibility – our Axyom software platform provides flexibility since it allows service providers to transition from current monolithic, legacy solutions to Axyom VNFs that can be run on bare metal or in virtual environments, either virtual machines or containers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 End-to-End Products on a Converged Core and Multi-Access Intelligent Edge
 We offer a full end-to-end portfolio of all-access broadband network solutions that extend from a cloud-native, converged network core to the customer premises. Our products help CSPs deploy more capacity at the network edge, closer to where end users and devices are accessing the network, thereby increasing available bandwidth and reducing latency to improve quality of service. In addition, our converged network core supports wireline and wireless access and avoids separate cores for each access type with overlapping functions (subscriber management, session management, transport security, access aggregation and radio frequency, or RF, management) within the network. This enables operators to reduce long-term capital expenditures and operating expenses. Our convergence solutions may also enable operators to more consistently deliver services and execute policy across different access types.
 Ability to Upgrade Networks Remotely with Rapid, Seamless Addition of Bandwidth Capacity
 We designed our programmable architecture to enable rapid and seamless expansion of network capacity with the purchase of additional software licenses. This flexible approach helps CSPs respond to increased customer demands with rapid bandwidth and service provisioning.
 Additionally, our programmable architecture allows us to deploy technology updates to our customers remotely without the expense, disruption or network downtime caused by hardware replacements or field visits by personnel, while minimizing network downtime. We can remotely implement additional features or capacity in order to scale our solutions to meet the needs of our customers as they look to broaden the use and capabilities of our solutions. Similarly, we are often able to troubleshoot and assist our customers with technical issues through seamless software updates.
 Reduced Network Complexity and Lower Total Cost of Ownership
 Our converged software platform allows CSPs to significantly reduce the complexity, footprint requirements and costs of their networks by reducing parallel and otherwise redundant network architecture. The large capacity increases that our solutions enable, and the ability of our solutions to deliver broadband services over a converged core, translates to fewer pieces of equipment in the network and lower energy usage, operating costs and capital expenditures.
Our Growth Strategy 
 The key elements of our growth strategy are: 
 Continue to Innovate and Extend Technology Leadership Through R&D Investment 
 We believe that we offer market-leading broadband infrastructure solutions today. We intend to continue to enhance our existing solutions and develop new solutions in both our current and adjacent markets. For example, we have invested in and launched distributed access architecture solutions to allow our cable customers to densify their networks, providing higher bandwidth, which enhances user experience. Additionally, we have been investing in our core and access solutions for 4G/LTE and 5G wireless networks.
Further Penetrate Existing Customers 
 Our customers often deploy our solutions in a specific region or for a specific application, which may only account for a portion of their overall network infrastructure needs. We plan to expand our footprint within the networks of existing 
 10

customers as they realize the technological and financial benefits of our solutions, as well as sell our new solutions to them as they offer new broadband services to their subscribers.
 Expand our Customer Base by Expanding the Breadth of Solutions Sold to Customers
 We intend to sell additional solutions to our growing installed base of CSPs, particularly as they increasingly offer converged services to their subscribers. We have invested in developing a cloud-native platform that allows us to rapidly provide new applications and services to our customers. While we initially focused on providing solutions for cable service providers due to our founders’ experience in the cable industry, the commonalities between fixed and wireless network architectures have allowed us to expand our solutions into the fixed telco and wireless markets. Our fixed telco and wireless solutions have been purchased by several customers, including Tier 1 network operators globally. 
Invest in Our Platform through Selective Acquisitions 
 We may selectively pursue acquisitions that enhance our existing platform capabilities and are consistent with our overall growth strategy. For example, on July 1, 2019, we acquired NetComm for cash consideration of $162.0 million Australian dollars, or AUD ($112.7 million United States dollars, or USD, based on an exchange rate of USD $0.700 per AUD $1.00 on July 1, 2019). This acquisition has enabled us to expand our customer base, enhance our global footprint, extend our product portfolio to the far edge of the network, and further diversify our revenue sources.

 We offer end-to-end cloud-native, virtual, physical and distributed infrastructure and customer premise network solutions that enable our customers to provide fixed and wireless broadband services to consumers and enterprises.
Wireless
 Network Core
  
• | Virtual Evolved Packet Core, or vEPC. Virtualizing the LTE EPC allows service providers to reduce network operating costs, improve network efficiency and deploy new services faster. Built from the ground up, our vEPC is optimized for virtualized environments and implements control and user plane separation, or CUPS. It can be deployed stand alone or in conjunction with our other core network products, such as our Security and Small Cell Gateways.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11

 
• | 5G Core. We built our 5G core, converged to support fixed and wireless networks, to help service providers implement the shift from a single, one-size-fits-all core network toward a core that provides different logical networks, or “slices”, for different traffic requirements to support new use cases, including IoT, Enhanced Mobile Broadband, and Mission Critical Services. Our 5G core delivers several important features including:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | higher Gbps per vCPU;
--+----------------------


o | a solution deployable in containers with virtual machines, or VMs, or bare metal;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | location-independent placement of the control and user plane in a CUPS architecture;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | a smooth migration from 4G to 5G with efficient internal messaging between 4G and 5G network components; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | network slicing in a service-based architecture.
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Other elements of our core infrastructure network solutions include our Security Gateway, which enables secure encrypted access for subscribers roaming between trusted and untrusted networks, while providing high levels of density and performance, and our Wireless Gateway, which enables routing and security functions as well as traffic management, to provide secure connectivity for wireless endpoints and to enable broadband services such as LTE over Wi-Fi, including Wi-Fi calling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Small Cell solutions
  
• | Apex family of Small Cells. Our portfolio of indoor and outdoor Apex small cell solutions consists of remotely deployable access points that provide cellular connectivity services at the network edge in conjunction with transport security functions to address coverage and capacity challenges. These solutions allow CSPs to more cost-effectively densify their networks while simultaneously improving coverage and enhancing throughput. Our small cell portfolio includes our:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Lifestyle residential small cell, the Apex Pebble, which uses the user’s broadband connection rather than a cell tower connection to provide wireless service in areas outside of the operator’s coverage areas. We believe that our Apex Pebble offers unique features that include:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | attractive design that is intended to drive better acceptance by subscribers and thereby provide better RF coverage than utilitarian-looking small cells that are likely to be hidden away in places that reduce RF propagation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | untethered Wi-Fi backhaul option, versus the ethernet backhaul requirement in comparable traditional femtocells, which allows a user to place the device anywhere in his or her home where Wi-Fi is available without running or connecting additional cables to a home router.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Apex enterprise small cell with 4G radio capability, which supports two LTE carriers, in a small form factor.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Apex Strand solution, which is designed for both MSOs and mobile network operators, supports two LTE carriers (licensed LTE bands or citizens band radio service, or CBRS), and takes advantage of existing hybrid-fiber cable, or HFC, strand to help solve the power, backhaul and siting issues that accompany large-scale small cell deployments.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 5G indoor small cell, which offers support for licensed LTE/5G bands and eventually CBRS and C-Band and is designed for environments with a large number of subscribers or where a larger coverage area is required. Our 5G indoor small cell helps our wireless customers meet the coverage and capacity challenges in dense urban and suburban areas where large numbers of NR and LTE devices are present. The 5G indoor small cell All-in-One package includes the baseband unit and the radio remote unit with flexible external antenna configurations. It also supports open radio access network defined interfaces for centralized and virtualized radio access network deployments.

Axyom Element Management System, or AeMS
  
• | We designed our AeMS to make small cell deployment and management more efficient for service providers as they expand and evolve their mobile access networks. Our virtualized AeMS provides full life-cycle management, which allows the provider to manage large scale deployments of small cells within complex network environments. It includes key management tools that facilitate integration with existing networks and increase radio access network utilization with zero-touch plug and play configuration of small cells. The AeMS provides visibility and access to all modules from a single-pane-of-glass dashboard which gives service providers the ability to monitor and control small cells efficiently and effectively. In 2020 we expanded our AeMS to use cases beyond small cell deployment management, and have connected our distribution point unit, or DPU. In 2021 we expect to add to our fixed-wireless access solutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed Wireless Access
  
• | Our Fixed Wireless Access, or FWA, solutions enable service providers to offer fixed, ultra-broadband services to their customers where the service provider does not own copper, fiber or coaxial cable to the customer premise, or where these access media are not cost-efficient to deploy. Connections are instead serviced by a 3GPP compliant wireless connection in a manner that optimizes overall network efficiency and provides a higher grade of broadband service than would typically be achieved via a typical mobile handset. Our fixed wireless solutions support 4G and 5G, including our newly launched 5G millimeter wave FWA device. These can be delivered as self-install indoor units or as pro-install outdoor units that are mounted to the side of the customer premise. We designed our portfolio with a heavy emphasis on reducing the total cost of ownership for operators, achieved through class-leading hardware performance and build quality and our range of install accessories that optimize the installation process and overall install success rate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cable
 Our solutions for cable service providers can be deployed in a centralized, distributed or virtual environment. While centralized deployments allow our customers to deploy all critical CCAP functions in a single location, distributed and virtual deployments enable our customers to densify the access network by distributing access deeper into the network, away from existing data centers. 
Virtual Deployment
  
• | Cable service providers are actively evaluating virtualized versions of network functions, as well as software-defined networking control and orchestration to enable faster service creation and more nimble response to changes in service and bandwidth demand. In cable access networks, this trend is accompanied by fiber-deep strategies that push required ultra-broadband bandwidth closer to subscribers. Our Distributed Access Architecture solutions and virtual converged cable access platform, or vCCAP, create a secure, scalable, high-performance next-generation cable access network.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our vCCAP provides all the features of our C100G CCAP on commercial-off-the-shelf, or COTS, servers in a flexible architecture that enables independent scaling of control and data planes. We built our vCCAP on our Axyom modular software framework for the cloud from the ground up. It delivers high performance and deployment flexibility in edge or core environments. Our virtual solutions also enable migration from physical network functions, or PNFs, to VNFs with a common management interface to both.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | While our customers continue primarily to rely on their existing i-CCAP infrastructure to provide gigabit broadband service to their customers, our vCCAP and Distributed Access Architectures, or DAA, products have been deployed by several of our customers and, as of December 31, 2021, we are currently in over 70 trials with our customers globally.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Centralized Deployment
 Integrated CCAP – C100G and C40G
  
• | Our C100G CCAP combines (i) cable modem termination system, or CMTS, functionality, which enables IP data transport from data centers to end-users over cable networks, including voice over IP, or VoIP, and (ii) edge-quadrature amplitude modulation, or Edge-QAM, functionality to enable video delivery over cable networks in one integrated chassis. We believe our C100G CCAP was the first solution offering full CCAP functionality, allowing the delivery of voice, video and data on a single platform. Our C100G CCAP also
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13

 
features high downstream speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second, high upstream channel capacity, and low space and energy consumption requirements. Using our C100G CCAP, our customers whose networks are configured for DOCSIS 3.0 can adopt DOCSIS 3.1 through either a software upgrade or a simple line card addition, while continuing to service their customers who use DOCSIS 3.0 modems. We are also able to increase capacity for our C100G CCAP through channel expansions, which are delivered via software-enabled increases in bandwidth capacity. We believe that our software-centric approach will enable us to seamlessly provide our customers with future updates as standards evolve.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In addition to our C100G CCAP, we also offer our C40G CCAP, which provides per rack unit performance comparable to that of our C100G CCAP, but in a smaller form factor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our CCAP solutions offer three key differentiating applications compared to a single cable network:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | DOCSIS Core. Provides high-speed delivery of IP data for broadband connectivity services, including VoIP.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Video Core. Delivers high-speed video processing, including for HD and 4K.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Intelligent Routing. Intelligently manages network traffic to optimize service quality.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Distributed Deployment
 
• | DAAs offer a new approach for service providers that are looking to increase capacity in their networks. Our family of DAA solutions is designed to help service providers push capacity to the network edge to improve the services their subscribers enjoy, extract more value from existing investments, and maintain smooth operations in the transition from centralized to distributed access architectures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our family of DAA solutions includes:
--+--------------------------------------


o | Physical or virtual CCAP cores that deliver full CCAP and full spectrum DOCSIS 3.1 support and are compliant with CableLabs’ interoperability standards.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The CCAP Service Card, or CSC, deployable in our C100G or C40G chassis, which provides the complete DOCSIS and Edge-QAM media access control, or MAC, functions as well as traffic aggregation for the DAA nodes or shelves.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | A range of DAA node and shelf form factors that perform complete DOCSIS and EQAM physical layer, or PHY, or MAC/PHY functions. Our remote PHY, or R-PHY, solutions for cable networks retain software-driven network control and intelligence functions at the network core while placing physical layer functions remotely in a fiber node and the network edge. Our remote MAC/PHY, or R-MAC/PHY, solution for cable networks offers the capabilities of our R-PHY solution while also moving media access control functions from the network core to remotely deployed R-MAC/PHY nodes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 10G Ethernet transport between the CCAP core and the DAA nodes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

Bandwidth Capacity Expansion
  
• | Software. Our customers can add additional bandwidth capacity to their CCAP solutions by purchasing perpetual software license upgrades. Our software platform also permits additional features to be provisioned remotely, as compared to hardware-centric solutions, which require wholesale hardware replacements. As new standards and services evolve and broadband networks become increasingly virtualized, we expect we will be able to deliver additional capabilities as software-only updates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Line cards. Our customers may also purchase additional bandwidth in the form of our upstream and downstream line cards. Our line card expansion options allow our customers to rapidly add new service interfaces and physical connection capacity without the need for chassis replacements. In addition, our expansion cards can cost-effectively enable support for our distributed access solutions utilizing the same C100G CCAP chassis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Fixed-Line Broadband
 Optical Access Solutions
  
• | Along with our centralized and distributed deployment solutions, we offer a portfolio of Passive Optical Network, or PON, solutions for centralized and distributed PON architectures that enable service providers to move fiber closer to the network edge and deliver a broader range of ultra-broadband services more efficiently
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and at higher speed. Our PON solutions include next generation 10G EPON and XGS PON alternatives, including optical line terminals and optical network units. We also offer a DOCSIS Provisioning over Ethernet system for seamless integration of our PON solutions with existing DOCSIS network protocols.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtualized Broadband Network Gateway Router and Multiservice Router
  
• | Our virtualized broadband network gateway, or vBNG, router provides advanced subscriber management and routing capabilities in a cloud-native, virtualized solution. By separating the control and data plane functions, our vBNG enables elastic scaling and service agility, while allowing the service provider to put the control and data planes where they make most sense. Accordingly, our vBNG can be deployed in either centralized architectures (on the same server in the data center or central office) or distributed ones (at the network edge or node closer to the end user). Our vBNG is deployed as a service on our Axyom NFV Framework. It is convergence ready with built-in access gateway functions, or AGF, interfacing with our 5G core. We support data plane slicing based on service (converged/legacy) with dynamic control of the slice from our 5G core. At the 2019 Broadband World Forum, we demonstrated how our vBNG and 5G core could enable subscribers to use services seamlessly as they move between mobile and fixed connectivity. This solution won us the Broadband Forum Innovation Award for 5G in 2019.

• | Our fixed-line portfolio includes our dis-aggregated Multi-Service Router, or MSR. Our MSR is built on commercial off-the-shelf switching platforms that use merchant silicon. Our MSR supports the BNG data plane on merchant silicon. It offers industry-leading throughput and capacity in a one rack-unit form factor. Our MSR operates with the vBNG control plane being separated on a server at any centralized location or integrated right within the switch CPU. Service providers therefore can pick and choose the type of data plane at each location based on scale and throughput needs. Our MSR is also a full-fledged Provider Edge, or PE, router. It supports layer 2 multi-protocol layer switching and layer 3 virtual private networks with resource reservation protocol for traffic engineering and Fast Re-route, a technology to provide fast traffic recovery upon link or router failures for mission critical services. It also supports edge access functions. Our MSR therefore offers the functionality of a BNG, PE Router, and Top-of-Rack switch all rolled into one.

• | Our customers use our vBNG to support their next-gen PON and multi-access edge computing deployments. As an example, we demonstrated an end-to-end solution using our G.fast DPUs and 10G XGS-PON ONTs working with our XGS-PON OLT-A product connecting to a multi-tenant vBNG. This solution offers a smooth migration path for telecommunications providers from digital subscriber line, or DSL, technologies to G.fast to fiber-to-the-home, while maintaining the same vBNG edge functions. Multi-tenancy allows customers to slice the same hardware infrastructure at the edge to different access methods based on service needs.

 Fiber Extension (Fiber-To-The-Distribution-Point “FTTdp”)
  
• | Our Fiber Extension, or FTTdp, solutions allow service providers to extend the fiber running in the street or basement, utilizing the copper lead-ins at an end user’s premises. The solution consists of a distribution point unit, or DPU, which is installed outside of the home or in the basement of a multi-dwelling unit and a Network Connection Device, or NCD, which is installed inside the home. Our DPUs are reverse powered from the NCD when there is no power source available at the location of the DPU and where installing local power is costly and time consuming for the service provider. Our FTTdp solutions offer a cost- and time-effective means to provide a fiber-to-the-home experience to the end user and the operator, reducing time delays and cost overruns where the fiber penetration into buildings becomes problematic. Our portfolio focuses on cost optimization for service providers, with solutions ranging from software through to accessories that enhance the installation process.

 Machine-to-Machine, or M2M, and Industrial Internet of Things, or IIoT
  
• | Our M2M and IIoT routers provide businesses and governments with networking products that are enabled for 3G and 4G/LTE data communication. We designed these routers for applications such as retail, transportation, health, metering digital signage, security, banking and mining. These solutions enable remote diagnostics, real-time monitoring, and wireless access via the Internet. Our routers are designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions and extreme temperatures. Dual file-system management enhances solution reliability, while integrated open-source software development kits enable customers to customize our routers for specific-use cases.

Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our solutions and services through our direct sales force and in partnership with our resellers and sales agents. Our sales force is supported by our sales engineering team, which has deep technical expertise and the capability for product presentations, product evaluations, trials and customer care. Each sales team is responsible for specific direct end-customer accounts and/or a geographic territory across the following regions: North America, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
 Our products typically have a long sales cycle, requiring detailed discussions with prospective customers about their network requirements and technology roadmaps. To help us succeed in a market characterized by long sales cycles, we have developed strong customer relationships, which in turn provide us with insight into how our products will be deployed in our customers’ networks. We involve product engineers in the sales process, enabling them to build relationships with customers that are valuable both during implementation and in post-sales customer support. These relationships also provide us with opportunities to leverage our familiarity with our customers’ needs to make additional sales following the initial sale. 
 We also use resellers to market, sell and support our products and services, and we use sales agents to assist our direct global sales force with certain customers, primarily in the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. 
 Our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences, web marketing, trade shows, seminars and events, public relations, analyst relations, demand generation and direct marketing. We undertake our marketing activities to build our brand, increase customer awareness, communicate our product advantages, and generate qualified leads for our direct sales force, as well as our resellers and sales agents.
 Competition 
 The CSP market is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology trends and shifting customer needs.
 We primarily compete with larger and more established companies in the CSP market, such as Adtran, Cisco, CommScope, Ericsson, Huawei, Inseego, Nokia and Samsung.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. Nevertheless, many of our competitors have substantial competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and substantially greater financial, technical, research and development or other resources than we do.
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new broadband solutions for the fixed, wireless and cable communications markets and enhancing our current solutions to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We aim to be first to market with deployable, innovative solutions. We are willing to invest early in research and development and take technological risks to meet these goals. We also seek to enhance our technological innovation through our partnerships with industry standard-setting organizations and groups, such as CableLabs, 3GPP, and Wi-Fi Alliance. These efforts position us to be able to advance industry standards while evolving our solutions to meet those new standards. 
Manufacturing 
 We partner with multiple global contract manufacturing companies to manufacture the hardware for our solutions using the designs, components and standards that we specify. We conduct final assembly and quality assurance testing at our in-house and outsourced manufacturing facilities. We believe our combination of in-house and outsourced manufacturing capabilities, assembly and quality assurance testing allows us to maintain consistent and quality product for our customers. We also believe that this manufacturing model enables us to respond quickly to technological changes and supports our engineering goal of being first to market with deployable products. We believe our inventory management enables us to offer shorter times between order and delivery to our customers as compared to our competitors. 
 Our contract manufacturers purchase the materials and components for our solutions through a variety of major electronics suppliers. While the majority of material and component inputs for our solutions are generally available, since 2020 we have experienced disruption from component shortages and other supply chain issues that have delayed delivery of certain products to our customers and have had a material, adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Please refer to our Risk Factor on third-party manufacturers, under Risks Related to Supply Chain and Inventory Management.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections. To date, we have focused our efforts to protect our intellectual property primarily on trade secrets.
 We have obtained or applied for patents and have registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many foreign countries. At December 31, 2021, we held eight U.S. patents, with expiration dates through 2041, and had multiple patent applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered or applied to register various trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, including for Casa Systems, NetComm and our four-triangle pyramid logo. 
 17

We limit access to and use of our proprietary software, technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants, customers and vendors and other measures for maintaining trade secret protection. We generally license our software to customers pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on their ability to use the software, including prohibitions on reverse engineering and limitations on the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute nondisclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreements and by restricting access to our source code. 
 We also incorporate a number of third-party software programs into our solutions pursuant to license agreements. Our software is not substantially dependent on any third-party software, although in some cases it utilizes open source code.
 
Human Capital and Empowerment
 Our company was founded on the principle that people are our greatest asset. We pride ourselves on our culture of innovation, which is driven by our management team of experienced executives and engineers with deep industry expertise. Our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly highly-skilled engineers involved in the design, development, support and manufacture of new and existing products. In order for us to attract the best talent, we aim to offer challenging work in an environment that enables our employees to learn, grow and reach their full potential. 
 Core to our empowerment strategy is embracing diversity and building a culture of inclusion across the organization. We are working to achieve this by expanding the diversity of our workforce, creating growth and development opportunities for our employees, embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive work environment for all. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,004 full-time employees, of which 334 were located in the United States and 670 were located outside the United States. Our workforce as of December 31, 2021 consisted of 628 employees in engineering and research and development, 181 employees in sales and marketing, 91 employees in general and administrative, 67 employees in manufacturing and 37 employees in services and support. None of our employees are represented by unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
 Our human capital resource objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees. We strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry and across the globe by offering competitive compensation and benefits that support their health, and financial and emotional well-being. Our compensation philosophy is based on rewarding each employee’s individual contributions and striving to achieve equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace. Examples of benefits offered in the U.S. include a 401(k) plan with employer matching contributions; health benefits; life, business travel and disability insurance; additional voluntary insurance; paid time off and parental leave; paid counseling assistance; child and elder care assistance; family college planning and corporate discounts. For further information concerning our equity incentive plans, see Note 13, Stock-based Compensation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 We conduct annual assessments that review department goals to identify talent needs, assess how each division is positioned from a talent perspective, review the current state of talent vitality for each department, review key talent segments and prioritize actions to identify and develop talent. We regularly consider succession plans and focus on promoting internal talent to help grow our employees' careers. We encourage all employees to never stop learning through “Casa Systems University”, an on-line platform offering our employees continued learning on various technology and business topics.
