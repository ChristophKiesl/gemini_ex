Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a global, patient-dedicated biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and delivering novel medicines for rare diseases. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by the first, oral monotherapy for Fabry disease that has achieved widespread global approval, a differentiated biologic for Pompe disease, and an industry leading rare disease gene therapy portfolio.
The cornerstone of our portfolio is Galafold® (also referred to as "migalastat"), the first and only approved oral precision medicine for people living with Fabry disease who have amenable genetic variants. Migalastat is currently approved under the trade name Galafold® in the United States ("U.S."), European Union ("E.U."), United Kingdom ("U.K."), and Japan, with multiple additional approvals granted and applications pending in several geographies around the world. 
The lead biologics program of our pipeline is Amicus Therapeutics GAA ("AT-GAA", also known as ATB200/AT2221, or cipaglucosidase alfa/miglustat), a novel, clinical-stage, potential best-in-class treatment paradigm for Pompe disease. In February 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") granted Breakthrough Therapy designation ("BTD") to AT-GAA for the treatment of late onset Pompe disease. We initiated the rolling Biologic License Application ("BLA") submission to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2020.
We have established an industry leading gene therapy portfolio of potential therapies for people living with rare metabolic diseases, through a license with Nationwide Children's Hospital ("Nationwide Children’s") and an expanded collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania ("Penn"). Our pipeline includes gene therapy programs in rare, neurologic lysosomal disorders ("LDs"), specifically: CLN6, CLN3, and CLN1 Batten disease, Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDKL5 deficiency disorder ("CDD"), Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIB ("MPS IIIB"), as well as a next generation program in Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIA ("MPS IIIA"). Our expanded collaboration with Penn also provides us with exclusive disease-specific access and the option rights to develop potentially disruptive new gene therapy platform technologies and programs for most LDs and a broader portfolio of more prevalent rare diseases, including Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Myotonic Dystrophy, and select other muscular dystrophies. In the first quarter of 2020, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the CLN3 Batten disease gene therapy, AT-GTX-502, for the treatment of pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. In September 2020 and February 2021, the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") granted Priority Medicines ("PRIME") designation and the FDA granted Fast Track designation, respectively, to the CLN6 Batten disease gene therapy, AT-GTX-501, for the treatment of patients with variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 6 ("vLINCL6").
In July 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement for a $400 million credit facility with Hayfin Capital Management (“Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026”) with an interest rate equal to 3-month LIBOR, subject to a 1% floor, plus 6.5% per annum and requires interest-only payments until mid-2024 and matures in six years in 2026. This transaction resulted in net proceeds of $385.9 million, after deducting fees and expenses. There were no warrants or equity conversion features associated with the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026. Additionally, we used $156.3 million of the proceeds to voluntarily settle the principal amount, accrued interest, and early settlement premiums of the Senior Secured Term Loan with BioPharma Credit PLC that was due in 2023 ("Senior Secured Term Loan due 2023").

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to create, manufacture, test, and deliver the highest quality medicines for people living with rare metabolic diseases through internally developed, acquired, or in-licensed products and product candidates that have the potential to obsolete current treatments, provide significant benefits to patients, and be first- or best-in-class. In addition to our programs in Fabry and Pompe diseases, we are leveraging our global capabilities to develop and expand our robust pipeline in genomic medicine. We have made significant progress toward fulfilling our vision of building a leading global biotechnology company focused on rare metabolic diseases. 
Our operations have not been significantly impacted from the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic in 2020; however, we observed increased lag times between patient identification and Galafold® initiation due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in the fourth quarter. We have maintained operations in all geographies, secured our global supply chain for our commercial and clinical products, as well as maintained the operational integrity of our clinical trials, with minimum disruptions. Our ability to continue to operate without any significant disruptions will depend on the continued health of our employees, the ongoing demand for Galafold® and the continued operation of our global supply chain. We have continued to provide uninterrupted access to medicines for those in need of treatment, while prioritizing the health and safety of our global workforce. However, our results of operations in future periods may be negatively impacted by unknown future impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Highlights of our progress include:
•Commercial and regulatory success in Fabry disease. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Galafold® revenue totaled $260.9 million, an increase of $78.6 million compared to the prior year. We continue to see strong commercial momentum and expansion into additional geographies. In countries where we have been operating the longest, such as Germany and the U.K., we see an increasing proportion of previously untreated patients come onto Galafold®. In the U.S., we continue to see a significant increase in patients from a growing and very wide prescriber base. Across all markets, we see a high rate of compliance and adherence to this oral treatment option. 
•Pompe clinical program milestones. In December 2020, we completed last patient, last visit in our global Phase 3 pivotal study of AT-GAA (ATB200-03, also known as "PROPEL") with 123 patients at 62 sites in 24 countries and initiated the rolling BLA submission to the FDA for AT-GAA. In February 2021, we subsequently reported topline results for the PROPEL study. Additionally, in 2020, orphan drug designation was received in Japan and the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency issued a Promising Innovative Medicine ("PIM") designation for AT-GAA for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease. Previously, the U.S. FDA granted BTD for AT-GAA for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease. 
•Pipeline advancement and growth. We have established an industry leading gene therapy portfolio of medicines for people living with rare metabolic diseases through a license with Nationwide Children’s and an expanded collaboration with Penn. During the first quarter of 2020, we initiated the long-term follow-up of the initial participants in the CLN6 Phase 1/2 study. In October 2020, we reported additional positive interim safety and efficacy data in our ongoing CLN6 clinical study. Additionally, the research collaboration with Penn was expanded to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies for Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDD, CLN1, MPS IIIB, as well as a next generation program in MPS IIIA. 
•Manufacturing. We continued to manufacture our Pompe biologic at commercial scale (1,000L) for our clinical studies, including our pivotal PROPEL study, and early commercial inventory. Our supply agreement with WuXi Biologics and current capacity are expected to produce sufficient quantities to support commercial needs after receipt of applicable regulatory approvals if obtained. For gene therapy, we are working with our strategic partners to support our clinical manufacturing capabilities. During 2020 and thus far in 2021, our global supply chains have not been interrupted and we have thus far maintained our ability to manufacture Galafold® as well as our clinical supply during the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Financial strength. Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2020 was $483.3 million. Based on current operating models, we believe that the current cash position, which includes the net proceeds from the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026 and expected revenues is sufficient to fund our operations and ongoing research programs to achieve self-sustainability. Potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, business development

collaborations, pipeline expansion, and investment in manufacturing capabilities could impact our future capital requirements.
Our Commercial Product and Product Candidates
Galafold® (Migalastat HCl) for Fabry Disease
Our oral precision medicine Galafold® was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in August 2018 under the brand name Galafold® for the treatment of adults with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable galactosidase alpha gene ("GLA") variant based on in vitro assay data. The FDA approved Galafold® for 348 amenable GLA variants. Galafold® was approved in the E.U. and U.K. in May 2016 as a first-line therapy for long-term treatment of adults and adolescents, aged 16 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and who have an amenable mutation (variant). The approved E.U. and U.K. labels include 1,384 mutations amenable to Galafold® treatment, which represent up to half of all patients with Fabry disease. In countries where mutations are provided only on the amenability website, these 1,384 amenable mutations are now available. Marketing authorization approvals have been granted in over 40 countries around the world, including the U.S., E.U., U.K., Japan, and others. We plan to continue to launch Galafold® in additional countries during 2021. 
As an orally administered monotherapy, Galafold® is designed to bind to and stabilize an endogenous alpha-galactosidase A ("alpha-Gal A") enzyme in those patients with genetic variants identified as amenable in a GLP cell-based amenability assay. Galafold® is an oral precision medicine intended to treat Fabry disease in patients who have amenable genetic variants, and at this time, it is not intended for concomitant use with ERT. 
Gene Therapy for Fabry Disease
We are committed to continued innovation for all people living with Fabry disease. For people living with Fabry disease who have non-amenable variants, which are not suitable for Galafold® as a monotherapy, our strategy is to develop a Fabry gene therapy. In October 2018, we expanded our gene therapy portfolio through a collaboration agreement with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies, including Fabry disease, and other indications. In October 2019, we disclosed preliminary data from a Fabry adeno-associate viral ("AAV") gene therapy using an Amicus-engineered transgene that demonstrated high levels of GLA activity and robust GL-3 reduction in a mouse model of Fabry disease. In February 2021, we presented initial preclinical data from our investigational AAV gene therapy program. This initial preclinical study assessed a range of single doses of AAV in Gla knockout mice with either wild-type hGLA (“unmodified hGLA”) or an Amicus/Penn engineered hGLA transgenes (“engineered hGLA” or “AT-GTX-701”). The engineered hGLA AAV gene therapy demonstrated stable homodimer formation, enhanced temperature, plasma and neutral ph stability compared to the unmodified hGLA AAV gene therapy. In the lowest tested dose of AT-GTX-701, Gla knockout mice showed partial substrate reduction, while highest tested dose resulted in near complete substrate reduction. Additionally, AT-GTX-701 demonstrated significantly greater lyso-Gb3/GL-3 substrate reduction across all Fabry disease relevant tissues including the dorsal root ganglia (“DRG”), kidney, and heart, with reductions at low dose being equal to or greater than the reductions observed at higher doses with wildtype transgene and provided the first evidence for DRG storage reduction in a Fabry mouse model treated with an AAV gene therapy.
Fabry Disease Background
Patients with Fabry disease have an inherited deficiency of the alpha-Gal A enzyme that would normally degrade the lipid substrate globotriaosylceramide in the lysosome. Genetic variants that cause changes in the amino acid sequence of alpha-Gal A result in an unstable enzyme that does not efficiently fold into its correct three-dimensional shape and cannot be trafficked properly in the cell, even if it has the potential for biological activity. Galafold® is an oral small molecule pharmacological chaperone that is designed to bind to and stabilize a patient’s own endogenous target protein. This is considered a precision medicine because Galafold® targets only patients with GLA variants amenable to Galafold®.

Fabry disease is an X-linked disease caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which encodes the alpha-Gal A enzyme. These mutations can cause alpha-Gal A to be either absent or deficient. When alpha-Gal A is absent or deficient the substrates, GL-3 and lyso-Gb3 accumulate, leading to damage of cells within affected parts of the individual's body and causing the various pathologies seen in Fabry disease. Fabry disease leads to progressive, irreversible organ damage, typically involving the nervous, cardiac, and renal systems, as well as multiple other tissues. The symptoms can be severe, differ from patient to patient, and begin at an early age, resulting in significant clinical, humanistic, and healthcare costs. Fabry disease requires lifelong medical intervention to manage the complications of this devastating disease across multiple organ systems.
Fabry disease is a relatively rare disorder. The annual incidence of Fabry disease in newborn males has been historically estimated to be 1:40,000-1:60,000 (Journal of the American Medical Association January 1999 and The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease 8th edition 2001). However, more recent newborn screening studies in Italy, Taiwan, Austria, Spain and the U.S., which collectively screened more than 500,000 male and female newborns, found the incidence of GLA mutations to be between 1:2,445 to 1:8,454, more than ten times higher than previous estimates for classic patients (American Journal of Human Genetics 2006, Human Mutation 2009, the Lancet 2011, Journal of Pediatrics 2017, and JAMA Pediatrics 2018). When looking at only male newborns within these studies, the incidence of Fabry disease mutations is as high as 1:1,316 – 1:7,575 (Circulation in Cardiovascular Genetics 2009, American Journal of Human Genetics 2006, European Journal of Pediatrics 2017).
We believe that approximately 35-50% of the Fabry disease patient population may benefit from treatment with Galafold® as a monotherapy. Additionally, we expect that as awareness of late-onset symptoms of Fabry disease grows, the number of patients diagnosed with the disease will increase. Increased awareness of Fabry disease, particularly for specialists not accustomed to treating Fabry disease patients, may lead to increased testing and diagnosis of patients with the disease.
Currently, two other products, both ERTs, are approved for the treatment of Fabry disease: agalsidase beta by Sanofi Aventis and agalsidase alfa by Takeda, the latter of which is not approved in the U.S. 
Novel ERT for Pompe Disease
We are leveraging our biologics capabilities to develop AT-GAA, a novel treatment paradigm for Pompe disease. AT-GAA consists of a uniquely engineered rhGAA enzyme, ATB200, or cipaglucosidase alfa, with an optimized carbohydrate structure to enhance lysosomal uptake, administered in combination with AT2221, or miglustat, that functions as an enzyme stabilizer. 
The small molecule enzyme stabilizer, miglustat or AT2221, binds to and stabilizes ATB200, or cipaglucosidase alfa, in circulation to improve the uptake of active enzyme in key disease-relevant tissues, resulting in increased clearance of accumulated substrate, glycogen. Miglustat is not an active ingredient that contributes directly to substrate reduction ("glycogen"). 
We initiated ATB200-03 (or "PROPEL"), a global Phase 3 clinical study of AT-GAA in adult patients with late onset Pompe disease in December 2018 and completed last patient, last visit in December 2020. In February 2021, we reported topline results from the Phase 3 PROPEL study.
Patients enrolled in PROPEL were randomized 2:1 so that for every two patients randomized to be treated with AT-GAA, one was randomized to be treated with alglucosidase alfa. Of the Pompe patients enrolled, 77% were being treated with alglucosidase alfa (n=95) immediately prior to enrollment (“Switch”) and 23% had never been treated with any ERT (n=28) (“Naïve”). 117 patients completed the PROPEL study and all 117 voluntarily enrolled in the long-term extension study.
The primary endpoint of the study was the mean change in 6-minute walk distance as compared with baseline measurements at 52 weeks across the combined ERT Switch and ERT Naïve patient populations. In this combined population patients taking AT-GAA (n=85) walked on average 21 meters farther at 52 weeks compared to 7 meters with those treated with alglucosidase alfa (n=37). This primary endpoint in the combined population was assessed for superiority and while numerically greater, statistical significance for superiority on this combined population was not achieved for the AT-GAA arm as compared to the alglucosidase alfa arm (p=0.072).
Per the hierarchy of the statistical analysis plan, the first key secondary endpoint of the study was the mean change in percent-predicted Forced Vital Capacity (“FVC”) at 52 weeks across the combined population. In this combined population patients taking AT-GAA demonstrated a nominally statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference for superiority over those treated with alglucosidase alfa. AT-GAA significantly slowed the rate of respiratory decline in patients after 52

weeks. Patients treated with AT-GAA showed a 0.9% absolute decline in percent-predicted FVC, compared to a 4.0% absolute decline in the alglucosidase alfa arm (p=0.023). 
Patients within the combined study population demonstrated statistically significant improvements on the GSGC (“Gait, Stairs, Gower’s Chair”) key secondary endpoint, which captures strength, coordination and mobility, compared to a worsening for alglucosidase alfa treated patients in the overall population (p<0.05). Additionally, lower MMT (Manual Muscle Testing), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (“PROMIS”) physical function and PROMIS fatigue secondary endpoints favored AT-GAA treated patients over alglucosidase alfa treated patients. Results also showed improvements in the two important biomarker endpoints of Pompe disease (Hex-4 and CK), which significantly favored AT-GAA compared to alglucosidase alfa (p<0.001). AT-GAA demonstrated a similar safety profile to alglucosidase alfa. 
The PROPEL Switch patients entered the study having been treated with alglucosidase alfa for a minimum of two years. More than two thirds (67%+) of those patients had been on ERT treatment for more than five years prior to entering the PROPEL study (mean of 7.4 years). A pre-specified analysis of the patients switching from alglucosidase alfa on 6-minute walk distance showed that after 52 weeks from switching, AT-GAA treated patients (n=65) walked 16.9 meters farther than their baseline, compared to 0.0 meters for those patients who were randomized to remain on alglucosidase alfa (n=30) (p=0.046).
A pre-specified analysis of the patients switching from alglucosidase alfa on percent-predicted FVC showed that AT-GAA treated patients stabilized and slightly improved their respiratory function on this important measure while those patients remaining on alglucosidase alfa continued to significantly decline in respiratory muscle function. AT-GAA patients showed a 0.1% absolute increase in percent-predicted FVC while the alglucosidase alfa patients showed a 4.0% absolute decline over the course of the year (p=0.006).
The PROPEL Naïve patients treated with AT-GAA for 52 weeks (n=20) walked 33 meters farther than their baseline, on the 6-minute walk distance endpoint. The Naïve patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (n=7) walked 38 meters further than their baseline. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=0.60). Additionally, patients never previously treated with any ERT showed similar declines in percent-predicted FVC at 52 weeks of –4.1% for AT-GAA treated patients and –3.6% for alglucosidase alpha treated patients. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=0.57). 
    Gene Therapy for Pompe Disease
As part of our long-term commitment to provide multiple solutions to address the significant unmet needs of the Pompe community, we are also advancing a next-generation gene therapy treatment for Pompe disease. In October 2018, we expanded our gene therapy portfolio through a collaboration agreement with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies for Pompe disease and other indications. 
In April 2019, we presented initial preclinical data from our investigational AAV gene therapy program for Pompe disease. This initial preclinical study in Pompe knockout mice administered a single high dose of AAV gene therapy with either unmodified wild-type hGAA ("unmodified hGAA") or an Amicus/Penn engineered hGAA transgene with a Lysosomal-Targeting Cell receptor binding motif ("engineered hGAA"). The engineered hGAA AAV gene therapy demonstrated more robust and consistent glycogen reduction compared to unmodified hGAA AAV gene therapy, in all key tissues assessed in a Pompe mouse model. In the central nervous system, the engineered hGAA AAV gene therapy also showed robust glycogen reduction in neuronal cells, suggesting this may be an effective way to address neuronal aspects of Pompe disease. Unmodified hGAA AAV gene therapy showed minimal glycogen reduction in neuronal cells. This preclinical study provided initial validation for combining Amicus-engineered transgenes with Penn's AAV gene therapy technologies.
In May 2020, we presented preclinical data with the engineered hGAA AAV in single and combined central nervous system ("CNS") and systemic directed gene therapy in a mouse model of Pompe disease with advanced disease at treatment. The engineered hGAA AAV showed better targeting and clearance of glycogen storage at low doses in Pompe mice compared to unmodified hGAA AAV. High dose IV therapy showed strength rescue and the addition of high dose intracerabroventricular ("ICV") therapy to high dose IV provided incremental benefit.

Pompe Disease Background
    Like Fabry disease, Pompe disease is an LD that results from a deficiency in an enzyme, GAA. Signs and symptoms of Pompe disease can be severe and debilitating and include progressive muscle weakness throughout the body, particularly the heart and skeletal muscles. GAA deficiency causes accumulation of glycogen in cells, which is believed to result in the clinical manifestations of Pompe disease. Pompe disease ranges from a rapidly fatal infantile form with severe cardiac involvement to a more slowly progressive, late-onset form primarily affecting skeletal muscle. All forms are characterized by severe muscle weakness that worsens over time. In the early-onset form, patients are usually diagnosed shortly after birth and often experience enlargement of the heart and severe muscle weakness. In late-onset Pompe disease, symptoms may not appear until late childhood or adulthood and patients often experience progressive muscle weakness.
According to reported estimates of the Acid Maltase Deficiency Association, the United Pompe Foundation, and the Lysosomal Disease Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, there are 5,000-10,000 patients with Pompe disease worldwide.
Currently, one product, an ERT, is approved for the treatment of Pompe disease: alglucosidase alfa by Sanofi Aventis.
Gene Therapy for Various Types of Batten Disease 
Through our license with Nationwide Children’s and expanded collaboration with Penn, we are researching potential first-in-class gene therapies for multiple forms of Batten disease. Batten disease is the common name for a broad class of rare, fatal, inherited disorders of the nervous system also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses ("NCLs"). In these diseases, a defect in a specific gene triggers a cascade of problems that interferes with a cell's ability to recycle certain molecules. Each gene is called ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal ("CLN") and given a different number designation as its subtype. There are 13 known forms of Batten disease often referred to as CLN1-8; 10-14. The various types of Batten disease have similar features and symptoms but vary in severity and age of onset.
Most forms of Batten disease/NCLs usually begin during childhood. The clinical course often involves progressive loss of independent adaptive skills such as mobility, feeding, and communication. Patients may also experience vision loss, personality changes, behavioral problems, learning impairment, and seizures. Patients typically experience progressive loss of motor function and eventually those affected become wheelchair-bound, are then bedridden, and die prematurely.
We have two clinical programs in CLN6 and CLN3 Batten disease, and several preclinical programs including CLN1 and other types of Batten disease. CLN6 Batten disease results from a mutation in the CLN6 gene which primarily affects the nervous system and results in a late-infantile form of Batten disease. CLN3 Batten disease, the most common form of Batten disease, results from a mutation in the CLN3 gene which primarily affects the nervous system and results in a juvenile form of Batten disease. CLN1 Batten disease results from a mutation in the CLN1 gene which primarily affects the nervous system and results in an infantile form of Batten disease. 
Our Phase 1/2 study in CLN6 Batten disease enrolled thirteen patients who received a single one-time intrathecal administration of AAV-CLN6 gene therapy. In October 2020, we reported additional positive interim results from our CLN6 Batten disease AAV-CLN6 gene therapy program, AT-GTX-501. Interim safety data are available for 13 patients with CLN6 Batten disease. Interim safety data demonstrated the treatment with AT-GTX-501 was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events ("AEs") were mild and unrelated to treatment. No pattern of adverse events related to AAV or CLN6 immunogenicity was observed. Interim efficacy data are available within the Hamburg Motor and Language scores and showed a meaningful effect in slowing disease progression for twelve patients reaching the 12-month timepoint and for eight patients up to 24 months, post-administration of the AAV-CLN6 gene therapy. Additionally, in October 2019, we reported interim clinical data that suggested stabilization of various components of Hamburg Seizure and Vision scores in most patients from baseline to month 12 or 24, in particular those patients treated at a younger age, compared to the progression expected in matched untreated patients. The CLN6 Batten population is approximately 1,000 patients across our commercial landscape today and there are no approved therapies for this disorder.
-10-


In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single intrathecal administration of an AAV serotype AT-GTX-502 gene therapy in patients with CLN3 Batten disease. In the Phase 1/2 study, a total of three patients were dosed in the low-dose group, and based on the safety profile to date, the data safety monitoring board cleared us to begin enrollment in the high-dose cohort. One patient is currently dosed in the high-dose cohort. In February 2021, we announced initial safety for the first four patients up to 15 months post-administration of AT-GTX-502 and preliminary efficacy data for the first three patients in the low-dose cohort for up 15 months post-administration of AT-GTX-502, as well as one patient in the high-dose cohort for up to 3 months post-administration of AT-GTX-502. Initial results of the study suggest that AT-GTX-502 was well tolerated and demonstrated potential early signs of disease stabilization compared to a natural history dataset. CLN3 impacts approximately 5,000 patients across our commercial landscape today and there are no approved therapies for this disorder.
CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder 
We are researching a potential first-in-class genetic medicine for CDD consisting of a CDKL5 protein engineered for cross correction, delivered as either a protein replacement or as a gene therapy through our collaboration with Penn. CDKL5 is a gene on the X-chromosome encoding the CDKL5 protein that regulates the expression of several essential proteins for normal brain development. Genetic mutations in the CDKL5 gene result in CDKL5 protein deficiency and CDD. This disorder manifests clinically as persistent seizures starting in infancy, followed by severe impairment in neurological development. Most children affected by CDD cannot walk or care for themselves and may also suffer from scoliosis, visual impairment, sensory issues, and gastrointestinal complications. 
Other Preclinical Gene Therapies
We have a number of additional gene therapies in active preclinical development, including gene therapies for MPS IIIB as well as a next generation program in MPS IIIA. Our strategy is to develop first or best in class AAV gene therapies for these rare devastating pediatric neurological lysosomal storage diseases.
Strategic Alliances and Arrangements
We will continue to evaluate business development opportunities as appropriate that build stockholder value and provide us with access to the financial, technical, clinical, and commercial resources necessary to develop and market technologies or products with a focus on rare metabolic diseases. We are exploring potential collaborations, alliances, and other business development opportunities on a regular basis. These opportunities may include the acquisition of preclinical-stage, clinical-stage, or marketed products so long as such transactions are consistent with our strategic plan to develop and provide therapies to patients living with rare and orphan diseases.
Acquisitions
Celenex, Inc.
In September 2018, we expanded our pipeline by acquiring the rights and related intellectual property of ten gene therapy programs through the acquisition of Celenex, Inc. ("Celenex"). Celenex is a private, clinical stage gene therapy company whose lead programs are ten gene therapy programs including CLN6 and CLN3, which are in clinical stage, and several programs in pre-clinical stage. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay up to an additional $10 million in connection with the achievement of certain development milestones, $220 million in connection with the achievement of certain regulatory approval milestones across multiple programs and up to $75 million in tiered sales milestone payments. Celenex has an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital ("Nationwide Children’s"). Under this license agreement, Nationwide Children’s is eligible to receive development and sales-based milestones of up to $7.8 million for each product.
MiaMed, Inc.
In July 2016, we acquired MiaMed, Inc., ("MiaMed"), which is a pre-clinical biotechnology company focused on developing protein replacement therapy for CDD and related diseases. As part of the transaction, we may be obligated to pay up to an additional $83.0 million in connection with the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones, for a potential aggregate deal value of $89.5 million. 
-11-


Callidus Biopharma, Inc.
In connection with our acquisition of Callidus Biopharma, Inc. ("Callidus"), we may be obligated to make additional payments to the former stockholders of Callidus upon the achievement of certain clinical milestones of up to $35 million and regulatory milestones of up to $80 million set forth in the merger agreement, provided that the aggregate merger consideration shall not exceed $130 million. 
Intellectual Property
Patents and Trade Secrets
Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain proprietary protection surrounding our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, including both new inventions and improvements of existing technology, that are important to the development of our business, unless this proprietary position would be better protected using trade secrets. Our patent strategy includes obtaining patent protection, where possible, on compositions of matter, methods of manufacture, methods of use, combination therapies, dosing and administration regimens, formulations, therapeutic monitoring, screening methods, and assays. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, in-licensing, and partnership opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Lastly, we monitor third parties for activities that may infringe our proprietary rights, as well as the progression of third-party patent applications that may have the potential to create blocks to our products or otherwise interfere with the development of our business. We are aware, for example, of U.S. patents, and corresponding international counterparts, owned by third parties that contain claims related to ERTs, and small molecules for stabilizing enzymes. If any of these patents were to be asserted against us, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor or that, if we choose or are required to seek a license, a license to any of these patents would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
We own or hold license rights to several issued patents and numerous pending and issued applications, filed in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other jurisdictions that are related to Galafold® and our ongoing clinical programs:
•We own issued U.S. patents that cover the use of migalastat, the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Galafold®, in the treatment of Fabry disease, which expire in 2027, 2028, 2029, 2037 or 2038 and are listed in the FDA Orange Book. Foreign counterparts of the U.S. patents are pending or issued in Europe, Japan, and certain other jurisdictions. Further, we have pending U.S. patent applications covering various aspects of Galafold®, including methods of treating a patient diagnosed with Fabry disease with migalastat and their foreign counterparts. Any patents issuing from these applications will expire in 2036, 2038, 2039, 2040, or 2041.and we anticipate listing these patents in the FDA Orange Book if issued.
•We own several issued U.S. patents that cover various aspects of our investigational new treatment for Pompe disease, AT-GAA (ATB200/AT2221, an ERT/pharmacological chaperone combination) as well as foreign counterparts to the issued patents, most of which are still pending. Issued U.S. patents cover ATB200 compositions-of-matter, formulations, methods of manufacturing and methods of treatment and will expire in 2033, 2035 or 2037. We also have pending U.S. patent applications covering compositions, methods of treatment, methods of manufacture, and formulations with anticipated expiry in 2033, 2035, 2036, 2037, 2038, 2040, or 2042.

•From the Celenex acquisition, we acquired an exclusive license to composition-of-matter and intrathecal method of treatment patent applications covering the gene therapy for treating Batten disease that are pending in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other jurisdictions. Any patents issued from these applications will expire in 2033 or 2040. The patent covering an intrathecal method of treatment, which expires in 2033, has issued in Europe and Japan.
•From our agreement with Penn, we have license to Penn’s patent portfolio pertaining to vector and other platform technologies for treating Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDD, CLN1, MPS IIIB, as well as a next generation program in MPS IIIA. Any patents issued from these applications will expire in 2039.
Patent term extensions and adjustments, supplementary protection certificates, and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed above and may extend protection. 
In addition to our clinical programs, we actively monitor and file patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign countries on relevant technologies and pre-clinical programs. For example, we own or hold license rights to U.S. and foreign patents or patent applications covering the following:
•Gene therapy protein engineering technology;
•Gene therapy (e.g., Pompe, Fabry, CDLK5, MPS IIIB and next generation MPS IIIA) and ERT (e.g., CDKL5) programs and the use to treat specified diseases.
We cannot be certain, however, that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents.
•Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the effective date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest nonprovisional filing date. This period may be shortened by terminal disclaimer or further extended by patent term adjustment or extension. The term of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is 20 years from the earliest nonprovisional filing date.
The U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, and amendments thereto, more commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides for an extension of one patent, known as a Hatch-Waxman statutory extension, for each New Chemical Entity ("NCE") to compensate for a portion of the time spent in clinical development and regulatory review. However, the maximum extension is five years and the extension cannot extend the patent beyond 14 years from the new drug application ("NDA") approval. Similar extensions are available in European countries, known as Supplemental Protection Certificate ("SPC") extensions, Japan, and other countries. However, in the U.S. we will not know what, if any, extensions are available until a drug is approved. In addition, in the U.S., under provisions of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, we may be entitled to an additional six-month period of patent protection or market exclusivity for completing pediatric clinical studies in response to an FDA issued Pediatric Written Request before said exclusivities expire.

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, technical, scientific, and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in promptly filing patent applications on new discoveries, and in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We focus special attention on filing patent applications for formulations and delivery regimens for our products in development to further enhance our patent exclusivity for those products. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by contracting with our employees, collaborators, scientific advisors, and our commercial consultants to ensure that any inventions resulting from the relationship are disclosed promptly, maintained in confidence until a patent application is filed, and preferably until publication of the patent application, and assigned to us or subject to a right to obtain a license. We do not know whether any of our owned patent applications or those patent applications that are licensed to us will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, circumvented, or be found to be invalid or unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products and reduce the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. Neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we were the first to invent the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or patent applications. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantages against these competitors. Furthermore, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that any related patent may expire prior to or shortly after commencing commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage of the patent to our business and products.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secret technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with commercial partners, collaborators, employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and other contractors, and by contracting with our employees and some of our commercial consultants to ensure that any trade secrets resulting from such employment or consulting are owned by us. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be discovered independently by others. To the extent that our consultants, contractors, or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Collaboration and License Agreements
We have acquired rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates through licenses granted by various parties. The following summarizes our material rights and obligations under those licenses:
Nationwide Children's Hospital
In September 2018, we expanded our pipeline by acquiring the rights and related intellectual property of ten gene therapy programs through our acquisition of Celenex. Celenex has an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide Children’s. Under this license agreement, Nationwide Children’s is eligible to receive development and sales-based milestones of up to $7.8 million for each product.
-14-


University of Pennsylvania
In October 2018, as amended, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Penn to pursue research and development of novel gene therapies. Our gene therapy portfolio pipeline expanded to include Pompe disease, Fabry disease, CDD, CLN1, MPS IIIB, as well as a next generation program in MPS IIIA. This expanded collaboration with Penn also provides us with exclusive disease-specific access and option rights to develop potentially disruptive new gene therapy platform technologies and programs for most LDs and a broader portfolio of rare diseases, including Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Myotonic Dystrophy, and select other muscular dystrophies. 
Under the expanded collaboration agreement with Penn, Penn is eligible to receive certain milestone, royalty and discovery research payments with respect to licensed products for each indication. Milestone payments are payable following the achievement of certain development and commercial milestone events in each indication, up to an aggregate of $88.0 million per indication. Royalty payments are based on net sales of licensed products on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country- by-country basis. We will provide $10.0 million each year during the five-year agreement to fund the discovery research program. In connection with the collaboration agreement, in 2018, we made an upfront payment of $7 million in cash to Penn that was expensed to research and development expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
GlaxoSmithKline
In July 2012, as amended in November 2013, we entered into an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK"), pursuant to which Amicus obtained global rights to develop and commercialize Galafold® as a monotherapy and in combination with ERT for Fabry disease (“Collaboration Agreement”). Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, GSK is eligible to receive post-approval and sales-based milestones up to $40 million, as well as tiered royalties in the mid-teens in eight major markets outside the U.S. 
Manufacturing
We continue to rely on contract manufacturers to supply the active biopharmaceutical ingredients and final drug product for Galafold®, other pharmacological chaperones, our next-generation ERT product candidates, and our gene therapy product candidates. The active biopharmaceutical ingredients and final formulations for these products are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP"). The components in the final formulation for each product are commonly used in other biopharmaceutical products and are well characterized ingredients. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. We have implemented appropriate controls for assuring the quality of both active biopharmaceutical ingredients and final drug products. Product specifications will be established in concurrence with regulatory bodies at the time of product registration.
While our third-party manufacturers have met our current manufacturing requirements, we anticipate taking steps to increase our manufacturing capabilities for our gene therapy platform. Our current arrangement with third-party manufacturers provide sufficient quantities of our program materials to meet anticipated clinical trial demands.

Competition
Overview
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. In addition, several large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly focused on developing therapies for the treatment of rare diseases through organic growth, acquisitions, and partnerships. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources, provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with both existing and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise associated with research and development, regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient, and/or are less expensive than products that we may develop. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive to buyers.
Major Competitors
Our major competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the U.S. and abroad that have approved therapies or therapies in development for LDs. Other competitors are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have approved therapies or therapies in development for rare diseases for which pharmacological chaperone technology, or next-generation ERT may be applicable. Additionally, we are aware of several early-stage, niche pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies whose core business revolves around protein misfolding; however, we are not aware that any of these companies are currently working to develop products that would directly compete with ours. We are also aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are developing various treatments for novel ERTs and gene therapy. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and price.

Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products, including gene therapies, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Services Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to file a marketing application, to issue Complete Response letters or to not approve pending NDAs or biologic product license applications ("BLAs"), or to issue warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, litigation, government investigation, and criminal prosecution.
Biopharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics, potential safety, and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP"). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and at least one proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical safety evaluations, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, continue during the IND phase of development. Reproductive toxicity studies are required to allow inclusion of women of childbearing potential in clinical trials, whereas carcinogenicity studies are required for registration. The results of these long-term studies would eventually be described in product labeling.
A 30-day review period after the submission and receipt of an IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. The IND becomes effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA, and trials may begin at that point unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations are subject to a clinical hold.
-17-


Clinical trials usually involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable government regulations, Good Clinical Practice ("GCP"), as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an Institutional Review Board ("IRB"), for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support an NDA or BLA for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on pharmacodynamics effects and effectiveness.
Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients over longer treatment periods, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
The FDA has established the Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review.
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving gene therapies. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene therapy trials and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these trials. 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA for the determination of efficacy and safety. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee; although for orphan drugs these fees are waived, and the holder of an approved NDA or BLA may also be subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
-18-


The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Marketing applications are assigned review status during the filing period. Review status could be either standard or priority. Most such applications for standard review are reviewed within 12 months under PDUFA V (two months for filing plus ten months for review). The FDA attempts to review a drug candidate that is eligible for priority review within six months, as discussed below. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to evaluate major amendments submitted during the pre-specified PDUFA V review clock. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an Advisory Committee for public review, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an Advisory Committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA may also undertake an audit of nonclinical and clinical trial sites. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied and to be marketed. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. Complete response letters outline the deficiencies in the submission that prevent approval and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in an amendment submitted to the NDA or BLA, the FDA will then issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type and extent of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval commitments or requirements to conduct additional testing and/or surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including distribution and labeling restrictions which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, problems are identified following initial marketing, or post-marketing commitments are not met.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patent(s) with claims that cover the applicant's product or approved method of use. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same route of administration, active ingredients strength, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be, in most cases, therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as "generic equivalents" to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed "innovator" drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph 4 certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
-19-


If the ANDA applicant submits a Paragraph 4 certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph 4 certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph 4 certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph 4 certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
Patent term and data exclusivity run in parallel. An ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired ("New Chemical Entity Market Exclusivity"). Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph 4 certification that challenges a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval.
Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug for the same new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or new use.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unindicated uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Products approved under Subpart H or Subpart E carry additional post-marketing considerations and requirements.
Drugs may be promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, new safety information, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA, NDA supplement, BLA, or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. New efficacy claims require submission and approval of an NDA supplement and BLA supplement for each new indication.
The efficacy claims typically require new clinical data similar to those included in the original application. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA and BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs and BLAs. Additional exclusivity may be granted for new efficacy claims. Generic ANDAs cannot be labeled for these types of claims until the new exclusivity period expires.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to routine inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to access compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
-20-


Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant with FDA orphan drug designation for a particular active ingredient to receive FDA approval of the designated drug for the disease indication for which it has such designation, is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period ("Orphan Drug Exclusivity") in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not finally approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the license holder cannot supply sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition, provided that the sponsor has conducted appropriate clinical trials required for approval. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee for the orphan indication.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 ("PREA"), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Fast Track Designation
Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of an IND may request the FDA to designate the drug candidate as a Fast Track drug if it is intended to treat a serious condition and fulfill an unmet medical need. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. Once the FDA designates a drug as a Fast Track candidate, it is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of that drug by providing more frequent communication with and guidance to the sponsor.
In addition to other benefits such as greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug's NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's review period as specified under PDUFA V for filing and reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA has been submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a candidate that is planned for use to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A Breakthrough Therapy designation conveys all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. The FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance.
Priority Review
Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within six months from filing for a new molecular entity ("NME") or six months from submission for a non-NME if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease. A Fast Track designated drug candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA's criteria for priority review. The FDA makes its determination of priority or standard review during the 60-day filing period after an initial NDA or BLA submission.
-21-


Accelerated Approval
Under the FDA's accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. This approval mechanism is provided for under 21CRF314 Subpart H and Subpart E. In this case, clinical trials are conducted in which a surrogate endpoint is used as the primary outcome for approval. A surrogate endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. This surrogate endpoint substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives and is considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Such surrogate endpoints may be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. When the Phase 4 commitment is successfully completed, the biomarker is deemed to be a surrogate endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, could lead the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Section 505(b) (2) New Drug Applications
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA, an ANDA, or a BLA. A fourth alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b) (2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the safety and efficacy data of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application.
505(b) (2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA for which at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b) (2) applicant.
To the extent that the Section 505(b) (2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already-approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent as an ANDA applicant. Thus approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NCE, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph 4 certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ("PPACA") created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" or "interchangeable" with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or "fingerprinting", in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies, and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the development of a stand-alone NDA or BLA is necessary. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and Other Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes as well as regulations related to payments and transfers of value to healthcare providers, the protection of the security and privacy of protected health information, and other compliance efforts. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services, reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Physician Drug Samples
As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (the "PDMA") imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling, and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.

Regulation Outside the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Most countries outside the U.S. require that clinical trial applications be submitted to and approved by the local regulatory authority for each clinical study. In addition, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the U.S. before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
To obtain regulatory approval of an orphan drug under the E.U. regulatory system, we are mandated to submit a marketing authorization application ("MAA") to be assessed in the Centralized Procedure. The centralized procedure, which came into operation in 1995, allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid throughout the E.U. It is compulsory for medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes, for orphan medicinal products and for human products containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 (date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) and which are intended for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 or for products which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a Community authorization is in the interests of patients at Community level. When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralized procedure, it sends an application directly to the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), to be assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"). The procedure results in a Commission decision, which is valid in all E.U. Member States. Centrally-authorized products may be marketed in all Member States. Centralized procedure: Full copies of the MA application are sent to a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur designated by the competent EMA scientific committee. They coordinate the EMA's scientific assessment of the medicinal product and prepare draft reports. Once the draft reports are prepared (other experts might be called upon for this purpose), they are sent to the CHMP, whose comments or objections are communicated to the applicant. The rapporteur is therefore the privileged interlocutor of the applicant and continues to play this role, even after the MA has been granted.
The rapporteur and co-rapporteur then assess the applicant's replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP and, taking into account the conclusions of this debate, prepare a final assessment report. Once the evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the authorization. When the opinion is favorable, it shall include the draft summary of the product's characteristics, the package leaflet and the texts proposed for the various packaging materials. The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days. The EMA then has fifteen days to forward its opinion to the Commission. This is the start of the second phase of the procedure: the decision-making process. The Agency sends to the Commission its opinion and assessment report, together with annexes containing: the SmPC ("Annex 1"); the particulars of the MAH responsible for batch release, the particulars of the manufacturer of the active substance and the conditions of the marketing authorization ("Annex 2"); and the labelling and the package leaflet ("Annex 3"). The annexes are translated into the 22 other official languages of the E.U. During the decision-making process, the Commission services verify that the marketing authorization complies with Union law. The Commission has fifteen days to prepare a draft decision. The medicinal product is assigned a Community registration number, which will be placed on its packaging if the marketing authorization is granted. During this period, various Commission directorates-general are consulted on the draft marketing authorization decision.
The draft decision is then sent to the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, (Member States have one representative each in both of these committees) for their opinions. The Centralized Procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The Decentralized Procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state's assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to the public health, the disputed points may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

We have obtained an orphan medicinal product designation in the E.U. from the EMA for Galafold® for the treatment of Fabry disease and the combination product, ATB200/AT2221, for the treatment of Pompe disease. Applications from persons or companies seeking "orphan medicinal product designation" for products they intend to develop for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the E.U. are reviewed by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products ("COMP"). In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the E.U. and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the E.U. would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the E.U. of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients.
Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for fee reductions, protocol assistance and access to the centralized procedure before and during the first year after marketing approval. Fee reductions are not limited to the first year after marketing approval for small and medium enterprises. In addition, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives EMA marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan market exclusivity, which means the EMA may not approve any other application to market a similar drug for the same indication for a period of 10 years. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Competitors may receive marketing approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. In order to do so, however, they must demonstrate that the new drugs or biologics are clinically superior over the existing orphan product. This demonstration of clinical superiority may be done at the time of initial approval or in post-approval studies, depending on the type of marketing authorization granted.
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, the Priority Medicines (“PRIME”) scheme, to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIME scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. In September 2020, AT-GTX-501 was granted PRIME designation.
We have obtained a positive opinion for our pediatric investigation plan ("PIP") in the E.U. for Galafold® for the treatment of Fabry disease as well. A PIP is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form, or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the E.U. Medicines authorized across the E.U. with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months. This is the case even when the studies' results are negative. For orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity. Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the Agency are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization ("PUMA"). If a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive.
The U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020 following which, existing E.U. medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the U.K. during the transition period under the terms of the E.U.-U.K. Withdrawal Agreement. A transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the E.U. single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the E.U. on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the U.K. and E.U. to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement ("TCA") and became effective on January 1, 2021.

From January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") will be the U.K.’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland (together Great Britain, "GB"); broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the E.U. regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. The MHRA has published a draft guidance on how various aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development or commercialization of medicines in the U.K. The new guidance will be given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations ("Amendment etc.") ("E.U. Exit") Regulations 2019 (the "Exit Regulations"). The U.K. regulatory regime largely mirrors that of the E.U. 
The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, an accelerated assessment procedure and new routes of evaluation for novel products and biotechnological products. All existing E.U. MAs for centrally authorized products will automatically be converted ("grand fathered") into U.K. MAs free-of-charge on January 1, 2021. Galafold® now has a U.K. MA and we will have until January 1, 2022 to submit essential baseline data in order to support the conversion process. 
There will be no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA will review applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the GB market, i.e. the prevalence of the condition in GB (rather than the E.U.) must not be more than 5 in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period or market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB or E.U./European Economic Area, wherever is earliest.
The PIP application process for applicants is simplified by offering an expedited assessment where possible, and by mirroring the submission format, content and terminology of the E.U.-PIP system. The MHRA is taking decisions on PIP and waiver opinions, modifications and compliance statements to support pediatric market authorization decisions, while acknowledging that Northern Ireland continues to be part of the E.U.’s system for pediatric medicines development including agreement of E.U. PIPs or waivers.
The MHRA has maintained the Early Access to Medicine Scheme ("EAMS"). EAMS is designed to give patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions access to medicines that do not yet have a marketing authorization when there is a clear unmet medical need. It is anticipated that medicines with a positive EAMS opinion could be made available to patients 12-18 months ahead of formal marketing authorization. As the initial step in this process, the applicant must apply for and be granted a Promising Innovative Medicine (“PIM”) designation. The designation will be issued after an MHRA scientific designation meeting on the basis of non-clinical and clinical data available on the product, in a defined disease area. Following designation, the applicant is expected to complete a clinical development program within a reasonable time period, in order to continue with an application under the EAMS. In January 2020, the MHRA issued a PIM designation for AT-GAA for the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease.
We have obtained orphan drug designation in Japan for migalastat for the treatment of Fabry Disease. We also have other Orphan Drug applications approved in other world markets including Switzerland, Australia, South Korea and Taiwan. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, based on the opinion of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council, grants orphan status to drugs intended to address serious illnesses with high unmet medical need that affect fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan. In 2020, orphan drug designation was granted in Japan for AT-GAA for the treatment of Pompe disease. Orphan designation provides certain benefits and incentives, including priority review for marketing authorization and a period of 10 years of market exclusivity if the drug candidate is approved for the designated indication.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.

 Healthcare Reform
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. 
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. 
On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act pending further action by Congress. In October 2017, he signed an Executive Order which directed federal agencies to modify how the Affordable Care Act is implemented. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the former administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the 
-27-


federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry. 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. A ruling is expected in 2021.
The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”), among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act , effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” by increasing from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. 
Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.
Human Capital
At Amicus, one of our founding principles is that we believe in each other to foster teamwork and respect for each individuals' contribution. Our passion for making a difference unites us. Supporting our globally diverse employees is an essential part of the core values and culture at Amicus. Tied to these values and culture, we believe our success and our ability to help patients depends on our capability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. 
We also believe that diversity of experience and thought is essential. At Amicus, we are committed to the advancement of diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Diversity is the representation of all our varied identities and differences (race, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, tribe, socio-economic status, thinking and communication styles, etc.), collectively and as individuals. Equity seeks to ensure fair treatment, equality of opportunity, and 
-28-


fairness in access to information and resources for all. Inclusion means that all individuals feel respected, accepted, and valued. Inclusion builds a culture of belonging, by actively inviting the contribution and participation of all people. Combined, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") creates a work environment where every voice is heard and valued, resulting in a dimensional way of thinking that is used when meeting company goals. DEI at Amicus is about creating an environment that supports bringing the authentic employee to the workplace. Our unique experiences, cultures, and backgrounds are what make us so great at putting patients at the forefront of what we do and pushing ideas as far and fast as possible. As of December 31, 2020, we had 483 full-time employees. Currently, 50% of our executive management team are women and 20% of our board of directors are women. 
We believe it is critical that our employees are informed and engaged. We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, round tables, employee pulse surveys, company intranet, and acknowledge individual contributions through a number of reward and recognition programs. We believe these engagement efforts keep employees informed about our strategy, culture and purpose and motivated to do their best work. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also further strengthened our digital communication and social networking platforms. Our communications during the pandemic have kept our employees informed on critical priorities, important actions being taken by management in response to the pandemic, and continued efforts to protect employee’s health, safety and well-being.
We support and develop our employees through global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills. These are further emphasized through our engagement on employee career paths through the annual goal process, a tuition reimbursement program, providing the ability to attend industry conferences and trainings, and holding patient-mission focused Lunch and Learns. Additionally, we strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry and across the globe by offering competitive compensation and benefits that support their health, financial and emotional well-being. Our compensation philosophy is based on rewarding each employee’s individual contributions and striving to achieve equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, and share based compensation.
