Overview
 
    Piedmont Lithium Inc. is an exploration stage company developing a multi-asset, integrated lithium business contributing to the transition to a net zero carbon world and the creation of a clean energy economy in North America. Through this endeavor, we are focused on developing and manufacturing battery quality lithium hydroxide for the fast-growing electric vehicle industry. The centerpiece of our operations, our wholly-owned Carolina Lithium Project (“Carolina Lithium Project”), is located in the renowned Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt of North Carolina. We are geographically diversified with equity investments in strategic partnerships that own lithium resource assets in Canada and Ghana. Collectively, these resource assets and the location of these assets in the United States, Canada and Ghana, strategically position us to be a large, low-cost, sustainable producer of lithium products, serving the North American and European electric vehicle and battery supply chains. The geology, geography and proximity of our resources, planned production operations and customer base, should allow us to deliver a valuable supply of high-quality, sustainably produced lithium hydroxide from spodumene concentrate, which is preferred by most electric vehicle manufacturers. Our diversified operations should enable us to play a pivotal role in supporting the move toward decarbonization and the electrification of transportation and energy storage.

  Our Strategy
 
  Our strategy is to become a highly strategic, fully-integrated North American producer of lithium hydroxide using spodumene concentrate sourced from multiple global mineral deposits in which we hold both economic interests and long-term supply agreements. The centerpiece of our business will be our wholly-owned Carolina Lithium Project in North Carolina. We also hold economic interests and long-term supply agreement rights in an existing spodumene mine in Canada and pre-production spodumene deposits in Canada and Ghana.
 
Our strategy involves developing a low cost, highly sustainable, North American source of lithium hydroxide manufactured from both domestic and imported spodumene concentrate, giving North American battery and electric vehicle manufacturers better continuity of supply while also helping them meet their environmental commitments. A key component of our strategy is to become an “integrated” supplier with access to premier global mineral resources, spodumene concentrate facilities and lithium hydroxide processing facilities. This approach should allow us to become one of the most sustainable, cost-effective suppliers in the world, and further help potential customers achieve their important environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) goals required by shareholders and regulatory agencies.
 
Complementary to our lithium-based strategy is our plan to maximize the utilization of the Carolina Lithium Project’s mineral resources, including marketable byproducts quartz, feldspar and mica. The existence of these minerals in the Carolina Lithium Project’s ore body creates additional revenue streams while lowering production costs related to our primary extraction and processing of lithium hydroxide. The availability and marketability of quartz, feldspar, and mica will significantly reduce waste associated with the manufacturing of lithium hydroxide, thereby contributing to our sustainability goals within our ESG strategy.
 

       Our equity investments in Quebec, Canada, which include an existing North American Lithium (“North American Lithium” or “NAL”) mine near Val-d’Or, Canada, position us for potential future production of spodumene concentrate in the Province of Quebec, while taking advantage of low-cost, zero-carbon hydroelectricity. We believe our equity investment and earn-in agreement in Ghana will provide us access to hard rock lithium assets including a future long-term supply of spodumene concentrate through our existing spodumene concentrate supply agreement. 

Our strategy is to continue to evaluate strategic partnership opportunities with lithium projects globally that are located in favorable jurisdictions, have the potential for scale, low-cost, sustainable production practices, and are logistically-advantaged relative to our proposed lithium hydroxide manufacturing sites.
 
Our business plan is subject to market conditions and the ability to define an economically viable project. We intend to implement our business plan by:
 

• | completing additional drilling programs on our properties to expand current mineral resource estimates and increase geological confidence of our mineral resource estimates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Lithium Projects
 
Carolina Lithium Project
 
Overview
 
  Piedmont Lithium holds a 100% interest in the Carolina Lithium Project located within the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt, which historically provided most of the western world’s lithium between the 1950s and 1980s. The Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt is located approximately 25 miles west of Charlotte, North Carolina in the United States.
 
As of June 30, 2021, the Carolina Lithium Project comprised approximately 3,116 acres of surface property and associated mineral rights, of which approximately 1,329 acres were owned, approximately 113 acres were subject to long-term leases, approximately 79 acres were subject to lease-to-own agreements, and approximately 1,595 acres were subject to exclusive option agreements. These exclusive option agreements, upon exercise, allow us to purchase or, in some cases, enter into long-term lease agreements for the surface property and associated mineral rights. Our option agreements provide for annual option payments, bonus payments during periods when we conduct drilling, and royalty payments during periods when we conduct mining. Our option agreements generally provide us with an option to purchase the optioned property at a specified premium over fair market value. Our obligation to make annual option payments and drilling payments will terminate with respect to a property if we exercise our purchase option. We also own a 61-acre property in Kings Mountain, North Carolina.
 
We have reported mineral resource estimates as part of our exploration and evaluation activities, which include completion of 582 drill holes totaling 85,592 meters and spanning five drilling campaigns as of June 30, 2021. As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, we have completed 599 exploration drill holes totaling 88,185 meters and spanning five drill campaigns.
 
   Since securing the exploration rights and initial land position in 2016, we have focused on proving the potential of mineral resources for the Carolina Lithium Project. As of June 30, 2021, resource drilling has defined over 100 spodumene-bearing pegmatite bodies within areas of our properties with most of the spodumene-bearing mineralization on our properties occurring within 150 meters of the surface. The Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt is one of the premier locations in the world for exploration of lithium pegmatites given its favorable geology and easy access to infrastructure, power, research and development centers for lithium and battery storage, major high-technology population centers and downstream lithium processing facilities.

  Spodumene Concentrate Operation
 
 The integrated Scoping Study update for the Carolina Lithium Project is based on a 20-year project life, with an estimated average annual production of 248,000 metric tons of spodumene concentrate (“SC6”) at steady-state.
Lithium Hydroxide Conversion Operation
 
 The integrated Scoping Study update for the Carolina Lithium Project assumes a lithium hydroxide conversion plant, also referred to as a chemical plant, will operate for 20 years, with production commencing approximately 90 days after the start of the spodumene concentrator. The lithium hydroxide chemical plant has an estimated production rate of 30,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year.
Byproducts
 
 Our forecasted production of byproducts is based on the current process design of the concentrator and the demand estimates we have received from potential customers for these minerals. We have assumed that approximately 252,000 metric tons per year of quartz concentrate, approximately 392,000 metric tons per year of feldspar concentrate, and approximately 70,000 metric tons per year of mica concentrate will be produced at steady-state production on an annual basis.
Operating and Capital Costs
 
 The integrated Carolina Lithium Project is projected to have an average life of project cash operating cost of approximately $2,943 per metric ton of lithium hydroxide, including royalties and net of byproduct credits, potentially positioning Piedmont Lithium as one of the industry’s lowest-cost producers. The Scoping Study estimates total development capital costs to construct the integrated Carolina Lithium Project to be approximately $840 million, which includes land expenses, owner’s costs, and approximately $128 million in contingency.
Quebec Projects
 
Overview
 
 The Quebec Projects are located in the Abitibi region of Quebec, Canada, and are jointly owned by Piedmont Lithium and Sayona through a strategic partnership in Sayona Quebec. Piedmont Lithium and Sayona have equity interests of 25% and 75%, respectively, in Sayona Quebec.


  Sayona Quebec’s assets are comprised of three projects: (i) the Authier Project, (ii) the Tansim Project and (iii) North American Lithium, which was acquired by Sayona Quebec in August 2021 subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2021. Sayona Quebec is reviewing the potential consolidation of spodumene resources for these projects located in Quebec.
 
 The Authier Project is a feasibility-stage project located approximately 28 miles northwest of the city of Val-d’Or, a major mining center in Quebec. Val-d’Or is located approximately 290 miles northwest of the city of Montreal. The Authier Project is easily accessible by a rural road network connecting to a national highway a few miles east of the project site.
 
 NAL is an existing spodumene mine and concentrator currently in care and maintenance and is fully permitted with over $400 million previously invested in mining, spodumene concentrate and refining capacity. NAL is located approximately 20 miles from the Authier Project near Val-d’Or. NAL was operational and ramping toward nameplate production in 2018, when it was placed on care and maintenance due to weak lithium markets and poor capital structure.
 
The Tansim Project is an exploration stage project located approximately 51 miles southwest of the Authier Project.
 
  Technical studies will contemplate the integration of Sayona Quebec’s Authier Project with Sayona Quebec’s operations at NAL, including restart requirements, technical improvements, and optimization of NAL’s operations in order to fully utilize this competitive set of assets. Through the strategic partnership, Sayona and Sayona Quebec are prioritizing the manufacturing of lithium products in Quebec and capitalizing on Quebec’s competitive advantages, which include access to skilled labor, strong infrastructure, governmental mining support, and zero-carbon, low-cost hydropower.
 
 Technical studies are currently underway for the planned restart of spodumene concentrate operations for NAL. A definitive feasibility study integrating production from NAL and the Authier Project is expected in the first half of 2022.

See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.
 
Ghana Project
 
   On August 31, 2021, subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2021, we invested $15.9 million to acquire an equity interest of approximately 10% in IRR and to form a strategic partnership with IRR for the production of spodumene concentrate in Ghana. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.
Overview
 
   The Ghana Project is a strategic partnership between Piedmont Lithium and IRR through our purchase of an equity interest in IRR, our expected staged investments over a period of three to four years to acquire a 50% equity interest in IRR’s Ghanaian-based Cape Coast Lithium Portfolio (“IRR Ghana”), and a long-term supply agreement for 50% of IRR Ghana’s planned spodumene concentrate production. The Ghana Project is an exploration stage project located on the south coast of the Ghana and covering an area of approximately 425 square miles.
 
The Ewoyaa Project, which is the flagship deposit of the Ghana Project, is located on the south coast of Ghana less than one mile from the Takoradi-Accra National Highway with a relatively short transport distance of approximately 68 miles to the port of Takoradi. The project site is adjacent to high voltage power and is expected to have a low environmental impact due to reliance on solar and hydroelectric generating capacity to power operations.
 
Supply Agreement
 
  On July 1, 2021, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with IRR giving Piedmont Lithium 50% of IRR Ghana’s life of mine production of spodumene concentrate. Pricing for the offtake supply of spodumene concentrate will be at market rates at the time of purchase. Under the agreement, spodumene concentrate is priced on a CIF, China market price basis less ocean freight and insurance on a net back basis to first on board vessel (Incoterms 2020) at the Port of Takoradi, Ghana.
Investments
 
On August 31, 2021, subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2021, we paid GBP 11.5 million ($15.9 million) to IRR as part of an agreement:
 

• | to acquire to an equity interest of approximately 10% in IRR;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | with the ability to acquire a 22.5% equity interest in IRR Ghana by funding $17.0 million in the Ewoyaa Project for all of the exploration and definitive feasibility study expenses over the next 24 months; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | with the ability to acquire an additional 27.5% of IRR’s operations in Ghana, by solely funding an additional $70.0 million in capital costs for the Ewoyaa Project.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Strengths
 
We believe that we are well-positioned to successfully execute our business strategies primarily due to our following competitive strengths:
 

• | Located in a historical major lithium mining and manufacturing district in the United States—The integrated Carolina Lithium Project is located within the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt and along trend to the Hallman Beam and Kings Mountain mines, which historically provided much of the western world’s lithium between the 1950s and 1980s. The Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt extends over 40 miles in length and reaches a maximum width of approximately one mile. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Significant existing infrastructure—We believe the Carolina Lithium Project is well situated in a historical lithium district, with access to road and rail infrastructure, a highly skilled labor force, low-cost and low carbon sources of baseload grid power, research and development centers for lithium and battery storage, and access to major high technology population centers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversification of resources—During 2021, we made investments in and established strategic partnerships with Sayona and IRR. We continue to pursue opportunities to complement our business through additional acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and/or investments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquisition of past-producing assets—Subsequent to fiscal year 2021 and through our equity investment in Sayona Quebec, we successfully acquired the past producing mining assets of NAL located in the Abitibi region, near Val d’Or, Quebec, Canada. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology selection—During 2021, we partnered with Metso Outotec on lithium hydroxide conversion technology. We believe that the selection of Metso Outotec’s innovative alkaline pressure leach technology for the conversion of spodumene concentrate to lithium hydroxide should provide us with a relative advantage in capital and operating costs as well as our environmental profile, including carbon intensity, compared to other hard rock lithium conversion methods. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly experienced management team with a long history of developing and operating mining, energy, and lithium manufacturing projects—During 2021, we expanded our management team and increased our core skills with people experienced in the management, operations, sales and marketing of lithium manufacturing operations. Our management team has significant experience in acquiring, developing, and financing mining and chemical projects. We have increased our corporate capabilities in areas of finance, accounting, legal, and human resources. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing, Sales, Contracts and Principal Markets
 
  On September 28, 2020, we entered into a sales agreement with a vehicle manufacturer (“Buyer”) to provide spodumene concentrate to the Buyer. The agreement commits us to sell, at a fixed maximum price, a number of tons of spodumene concentrate equal to approximately one-third of our estimated average annual production. The agreement has an initial five-year term running from the first delivery date and may be extended by mutual agreement for a second five-year term. The agreement contemplates a number of areas where the parties must come to a mutual agreement. For example, the agreement is conditional upon the Buyer and our mutual agreement, based on the development schedules of both parties, to a start date for deliveries and to the parties agreeing in good faith to an allocation of certain material costs.
 
On July 31, 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Ion to form Pronto Minerals for the purpose of marketing and selling byproducts, specifically quartz, feldspar and mica, produced by our Carolina Lithium Project.
 
 10
 
  We continue to develop a marketing and sales strategy that includes production from the Carolina Lithium Project, as well as our other lithium projects. Based on historical and current production in the Carolina Tin-Spodumene Belt and other demand by producers in North Carolina, we anticipate producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide, spodumene concentrate, and certain other byproducts including quartz, feldspar and mica, all of which may be used by the global electric vehicle, energy storage and construction materials markets.
 
Specialized Skills and Knowledge
 
We rely on specialized skills and knowledge to gather, interpret and process geological and geophysical data, successfully permit and then design, build and operate extraction facilities and engage in numerous additional activities required as part of the mine-to-lithium hydroxide process. We have employed, and expect to continue to employ, a strategy of contracting consultants and other service providers with specialized skills and knowledge to supplement the skills and knowledge of our permanent staff to undertake our lithium operations effectively.
 
 11
 
 Competition
 
 We compete with other mineral and chemical processing companies, many of which possess greater financial resources and technical facilities than we do, in connection with the acquisition of suitable exploration properties and the engagement of qualified personnel. Although we aspire to be a leading lithium hydroxide producer in North America, the lithium mining and chemical industry is fragmented, and we are one of many participants in this sector. Many of our competitors have been in business longer and have established more strategic partnerships and relationships and have greater financial accessibility than we have.
 
While we compete with other exploration companies in acquiring suitable properties, we believe there will be readily available purchasers of lithium chemical products or other industrial minerals if they were to be produced from any of our leased properties. The price of our planned products can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including fluctuations in the market prices for lithium, supplies of lithium, demand for lithium as well as mining activities of others.
 
If we identify lithium mineralization that is determined to be of economic grade and in sufficient quantity to justify production, additional capital would be required to develop, mine and sell our production.
 
Government Regulations

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on us, subject us to significant potential liabilities, and have an adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations and/or competitive position. Violations and liabilities with respect to these laws and regulations could result in significant administrative, civil, or criminal penalties, remedial clean-ups, natural resource damages, permit modifications and/or revocations, operational interruptions and/or shutdowns and other liabilities. The costs of remedying such conditions may be significant, and remediation obligations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, federal, state and local legislative bodies and agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes in these regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to current requirements and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, other than with respect to the permitting activities of the Carolina Lithium Project, we have not been required to spend material amounts on compliance regarding environmental regulations.
 
Permits
 
 In November 2019, we were granted a Clean Water Act Section 404 Standard Individual Permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) for our planned concentrate operations. The USACE completed an Environmental Assessment of the project in conjunction with other state and federal agencies based on our December 2018 permit application and our responses to agency and public comments.
In 2019, we received a Clean Water Act Section 401 Individual Water Quality Certificate from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s (“NCDEQ”) Division of Water Resources.
 
We hold a Synthetic Minor Construction and Operation Permit issued by the NCDEQ’s Division of Air Quality for our property in Kings Mountain, North Carolina. However, we are not pursuing development of this property at this time.
 
Our exploration and evaluation activities for the Carolina Lithium Project include drilling, which is authorized under a general permit initially approved in 2017 by the NCDEQ and updated in April 2019, October 2019 and June 2021. We have reclamation obligations under this permit, pursuant to which we will be obligated to reclaim all disturbed drill pads and temporary roads to the approximate original contours and will seed with grass and straw to stabilize any disturbances. Generally, we are required to affect such reclamation within 14 days following drilling. We have concluded that these reclamation obligations are immaterial.
 
In addition to the permits that we have been issued to date, we will require other permits before construction or operations of the integrated business including mining, mineral concentration, or chemical manufacturing may commence. Other permits that are required for the Carolina Lithium Project include, but are not limited to, a state mining permit issued by the North Carolina Division of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources (“DEMLR”), a new air permit issued by the NCDEQ Division of Air Quality, and rezoning approved by the Gaston County Board of Commissioners.
 
We may require additional permits for the Carolina Lithium Project including, but not limited to, an NCG01 General Stormwater Permit for stormwater discharges from construction activities issued by DEMLR, an NCG02 General Stormwater Permit for mine dewatering issued by DEMLR, a road abandonment approved by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (“NCDOT”) and Gaston County under North Carolina General Statute 136-63, an Encroachment Permit for an at-grade rail crossing issued by NCDOT, various driveway permits issued by NCDOT, a Gaston County Watershed Permit approved by Gaston County Planning, various building permits approved by Gaston County Planning, explosives permits approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and Hazardous Chemical Permits issued by Gaston County Fire Officials.
 
Subsequent to fiscal year 2021, we submitted an application for a mining permit for the Carolina Lithium Project to DEMLR on August 31, 2021. We have not yet applied for other additional required permits described above.
 
Prior to developing or mining any mineralization that we discover, we will be required to obtain new governmental permits authorizing, among other things, any mining development activities and mining operating activities. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process and involves numerous jurisdictions, public hearings, and possibly costly undertakings. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our planned operations, or the cost and time required to obtain or renew such permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the exploration, development and/or operation of our properties. See “Risk Factors—We will be required to obtain governmental permits in order to conduct development and mining operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming, and there is no certainty that all necessary permits for our operations will be granted.”

U.S. Federal Legal Framework
 
The Carolina Lithium Project will be required to comply with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations and licensing and permitting requirements. The material environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that we must comply with include, among others, the following U.S. federal laws and regulations:

• | National Environmental Protection Act (“NEPA”), which requires careful evaluation of the environmental impacts of mining and lithium manufacturing operations that require federal approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and its amendments, which governs air emissions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clean Water Act (“CWA”), which governs discharges to and excavations within the waters of the United States;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which governs the management of solid waste;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability where hazardous substances have been released into the environment (commonly known as Superfund); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, which established the primary safety and health standards regarding working conditions of employees engaged in mining, related operations, and preparation and milling of the minerals extracted, as well as the Occupation Safety and Health Act, which regulates the protection of the health and safety of workers in lithium manufacturing operations and to the extent such protection is not already addressed by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our operations may also be subject to state environmental law and regulations, including but not limited to laws and regulations related to the reclamation of mined lands, which may require reclamation permits to be acquired prior to the commencement of mining operations and may require substantial financial guarantees to cover the cost of future reclamation activities.
 
Solid and Hazardous Waste
 
RCRA, and comparable state statutes, affect our operations by imposing regulations on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and on the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements.
 
In addition, CERCLA can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct on classes of persons who are statutorily responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons can include the current and former owners, lessees or operators of a site where a release occurs, and anyone who disposes or arranges for the disposal of a hazardous substance. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the entire cost of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for other costs, including response costs, alternative water supplies, damage to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners, workers and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the indoor or outdoor environment. Each state also has environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA. Hazardous wastes may have been previously handled, disposed of, or released on or under properties currently or formerly owned or leased by us or on or under other locations to which we sent waste for disposal. These properties and any materials disposed or released on them may subject us to liability under CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate disposed wastes or property contamination, to contribute to remediation costs, or to perform remedial activities to prevent future environmental harm.

Air Emissions
 
The federal CAA and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from numerous sources through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed permitting requirements. Air pollution regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain air permits and comply with stringent permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay our operations, and we may be required to incur capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related obligations. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources.
Clean Water Act
 
The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes, including mineral processing wastes, into waters of the United States, a term broadly defined to include, among other things, certain wetlands. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters. The CWA provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges, both routine and accidental, of pollutants. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties, and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that require permits to discharge storm water runoff, including discharges associated with construction activities. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and costs.
 
Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may also be required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of fill materials to regulated waters including wetlands without a permit from the USACE.
 
In May 2015, the EPA issued a final rule that attempted to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, but the agency repealed this rule in September 2019 and replaced it with the Navigable Water Protection Rule in April 2020, which narrowed federal jurisdictional reach relative to the 2015 rule. The repeal and replacement of the 2015 rule is currently subject to litigation, and the scope of the jurisdictional reach of the CWA may, therefore, remain uncertain for several years, with a patchwork of legal guidelines applicable to various states potentially developing. We could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas to the extent they are required.
 
 15
 
NEPA
 
NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects or increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities.
Endangered Species Act
 
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service continues its effort to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary. The ESA has not previously had a significant impact on our operations. However, the designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist.
Foreign Legal Framework
 
Our proposed projects with Sayona and IRR will be required to comply with all environmental laws and regulations in Quebec, Canada and Ghana, respectively.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” under the U.S. Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”) and will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of:

• | the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,070,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC) or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which we expect to be June 30, 2024; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1,070,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of shares of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000 as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified exemptions from various requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies in the United States. Generally, a company that registers any class of its securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act is required to include in the second and all subsequent annual reports filed by it under the Exchange Act, a management report on internal control over financial reporting and, subject to an exemption available to companies that meet the definition of a “smaller reporting company” in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, an auditor attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company, we will be exempt from the requirement to include an auditor attestation report in our annual reports filed under the Exchange Act, even if we do not qualify as a “smaller reporting company.” In addition, Section 103(a)(3) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) has been amended by the JOBS Act, to provide that, among other things, auditors of an emerging growth company are exempt from any rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the consolidated financial statements of the company.
 
Pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may elect to utilize an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for public companies until such standards apply to private companies. We have elected to utilize this extended transition period. This election is irrevocable.
