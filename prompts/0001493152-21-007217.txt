Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Reed’s Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Reed’s”, the “Company,” “we,” or “us” throughout this report) owns a leading portfolio of handcrafted, all-natural beverages that is sold in over 40,000 outlets nationwide (including the natural and specialty food channel, grocery stores, mass merchants, drug stores, convenience stores, club stores and on-premise locations including bars and restaurants). Reed’s two core brands are Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer and Reed’s Real Ginger Ale and Virgil’s Handcrafted soda. Reed’s Craft Ginger Beers are unique due to the proprietary process of using fresh ginger root combined with a Jamaican inspired recipe of natural spices, honey and fruit juices. Reed’s uses this same handcrafted approach in its Reed’s Real Ginger Ale and Virgil’s line of great tasting, bold flavored craft sodas, including its award-winning Virgil’s Root Beer.
 
Reed’s is the leading ginger beer in the US; Virgil’s is the leading independent (not aligned with Coca-Cola, Pepsi or Keurig Dr. Pepper) all-natural full line craft soda and is ranked fourth in the craft soda category.
 
Historical Development
 
Reed’s Original Ginger Brew, created in 1987 by Christopher J. Reed, our founder, and current Chief Innovation Officer and director, was introduced to the market in Southern California stores in 1989. By 1990, we began marketing our products through United Natural Foods Inc. (“UNFI”) and other natural food distributors and moved our production to a larger facility in Boulder, Colorado.
 
In 1991, we incorporated our business operations in the state of Florida under the name of Original Beverage Corporation and moved all production to a co-pack facility in Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1990’s, we continued to develop and launch new Ginger Brew varieties. Reed’s Ginger Brews reached broad placement in natural and gourmet foods stores nationwide through UNFI and other major specialty, natural/gourmet and mainstream food and beverage distributors.
 
In 1997, we began licensing the products of China Cola and eventually acquired the rights to that product in 2000. In 1999, we purchased the Virgil’s Root Beer brand from the Crowley Beverage Company. In 2000, we moved into an 18,000-square foot warehouse property, the Brewery, in Los Angeles, California, to headquarters. In 2001, pursuant to a reincorporation merger, we changed our state of incorporation to Delaware and also changed our name to “Reed’s, Inc.”
 
In September 2018, we completed the relocation of its headquarters to Norwalk, Connecticut. In December 2018, after a lengthy marketing and bidding process, we sold the Brewery to a company owned by Christopher J. Reed, our founder. The sale of the Brewery marked a fundamental shift in the nature of our operations and effectively eliminated our costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity.
 
Industry Overview
 
Reed’s offers its portfolio of natural hand-crafted beverages in the craft specialty foods industry as natural alternatives to the $32 billion mainstream carbonated soft drinks (“CSD”) market in the United States as measured by IRI Multi Outlet scan data. Reed’s products are sold across the country and internationally in the following major channels: natural food, specialty food, grocery, mass merchant, convenience, club, drug, and on-premise locations (bars and restaurants).


Even after a year of the pandemic, overall sales growth of natural food and beverage products continues to outpace sales growth for conventional products across all retail channels. We see ample opportunity to scale our natural beverage business and grow our distribution in these channels.
 
Carbonated Soft Drink Industry Overview
 
The retail CSD category has rallied during the pandemic. This past year, after 13 years of declines, the retail CSD category grew 13%. The ginger ale segment grew even faster at 15.4% and is now a $1.1 billion dollar market. Ginger ale growth, we believe, is driven primarily by a consumer perception of ginger ale as a healthier alternative to other sodas. Our new line of ginger ales made with real ginger deliver on this perception and are poised to breakout in the segment.
 
In the wake of COVID-19, consumers are shifting consumption to better-for-you products. We believe there is significant growth potential from consumers switching away from mainstream beverages that contain artificial ingredients and preservatives towards great-tasting, natural alternatives.

Consumer Trends Driving Growth for Our Products
 
The following is a list of consumer trends that are accelerating as we exit the pandemic, and which support our brands.
 

● | Natural: Interest in all-natural products has gone mainstream. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Clean Label: 62% of Americans are avoiding at least one ingredient. 
● | Reduced Sugar: A favorable trend for our zero-sugar beverages, 77% of consumers say they are reducing their sugar intake. 
● | Functionality: Right before the pandemic, 65% of consumers looked for function in what they eat and drink. This accelerating trend will drive growth for our ginger-based beverages. 
● | Craft: Appeal continues to grow of higher-quality, independent, and more authentic brands. 
● | Premiumization: A trend towards embracing quality has accelerated during the pandemic with consumers splurging on premium beverages at retail, including premium mixers. 
● | Better-for-you Mocktails: More consumers are seeking non-alcoholic alternatives with bold and unique flavors. 
● | Ready-to-Drink Cocktails: Category is exploding alongside hard seltzer as people seek novelty and variety, which puts our RTD Mules in a great position to succeed. 



Our strategies will remain responsive to these macro consumer trends as we concentrate our efforts on developing the Company’s sales and marketing functions.
 
Our Products
 
We make our hand-crafted beverages with only premium, natural ingredients. Our products are free of genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) and artificial preservatives. Over the years, Reed’s has developed several product offerings. In 2019, we streamlined our focus to our core categories of Reed’s Ginger Beverages and Virgil’s Craft Sodas. In April 2020, we launched our new line of Reed’s Real Ginger Ales, in both Full Sugar and Zero Sugar versions, made with 2,000mg of fresh organic ginger.
Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer
 
Reed’s Craft Ginger Beer is set apart from other ginger beers by its proprietary process of brewing fresh ginger root, its exclusive use of all-natural ingredients, and its authentic Jamaican-inspired recipe. We do not use artificial preservatives, artificial flavors, or colors, and Reed’s Ginger Beer is certified kosher. We offer different levels of fresh ginger content, ranging from our lightest-spiced Original, to our medium-spiced Extra, and finally to our spiciest Strongest. We also offer three sweetener options: one with cane sugar, honey and fruit juices; one with honey and pineapple juice; and another without sugar (Zero Sugar) made from an innovative blend of natural sweeteners (developed in 2018 and commercialized in 2019).

The Virgil’s line includes the following products:
 
Handcrafted Line: Virgil’s first Handcrafted soda was launched in 1994. It began as one man’s passion to create the finest root beer ever produced and has since won numerous awards. Virgil’s difference is using all-natural ingredients to craft bold, classic soda flavors. Virgil’s Handcrafted line includes Root Beer, Vanilla Cream, Black Cherry, and Orange Cream.
 
Zero Sugar Line: Virgil’s launched a new line of Zero Sugar, Zero Calorie craft sodas in 2019. Each Zero Sugar soda is sweetened with a proprietary blend of natural sweeteners with no added sugars.

Our Primary Markets
 
We target a smaller segment of the estimated $32 billion mainstream carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the United States. Our brands are generally considered premium and natural, with upscale packaging. They are loosely defined as the craft specialty bottled carbonated soft drink category.


We have an experienced and geographically diverse sales force promoting our products, with senior sales representatives strategically placed in multiple regions across the country, supported by local Reed’s sales staff. Additionally, we have sales managers handling national accounts for natural, specialty, grocery, mass, club, drug and convenience channels. Our sales managers are responsible for all activities related to the sales, distribution, and marketing of our brands to our entire retail partner and distributor network in North America. The Company not only employs an internal sales force but has partnered with independent sales brokers and outside representatives to promote our products in specific channels and key targeted accounts.
 
We sell to well-known popular natural food and gourmet retailers, large grocery store chains, mass merchants, club stores, convenience and drug stores, liquor stores, industrial cafeterias (corporate feeders), and to on-premise bars and restaurants nationwide and in some international markets. We also sell our products and promotional merchandise directly to consumers via the Internet through our Amazon storefront which can be accessed through our company web site www.drinkreeds.com.
 
Some of our representative key customers include:
 

● | Natural stores: Whole Foods Market, Sprouts, Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Gourmet & specialty stores: Trader Joe’s, Bristol Farms, Lazy Acres, The Fresh Market, Central Market 
● | Grocery and mass chains: Kroger (and all Kroger banners), Safeway, Albertson’s, Publix, Food Lion, Stop & Shop, H.E.B., Wegmans, Target, Walmart 
● | Club stores: BJ’s 
● | Liquor stores: BevMo!, Total Wine & More, Spec’s 
● | Convenience & drug stores: Circle K, CVS Health, Rite Aid 

Our Distribution Network
 
Our products are brought to market through an extremely flexible and fluid hybrid distribution model, which is a mix of direct-store-delivery, customer warehouse, and distributor networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics, and local trade practices.
 
Our product reaches the market in the following ways:
 
Direct to Natural & Specialty Wholesale Distributors
 
Our natural and specialty distributor partners operate a distribution network delivering thousands of SKUs of natural and gourmet products to thousands of small, independent, natural retail outlets around the U.S., along with national chain customers, both conventional and natural. This system of distribution allows our brands far reaching access to some of the most remote parts of North America. During the past year we expanded, and will continue to expand, in this distribution network.
Direct to Store Distribution (“DSD”) Through Non-Alcoholic Beverage Distributor Network
 
Our independent distributor partners operate DSD systems which deliver primarily beverages, foods, and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by their route sales and field sales employees. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products frequently restocked and responds to in-store promotion and merchandising. We are primarily focused on expanding our DSD network on a national basis.

Direct to Store Warehouse Distribution
 
Some of our products are delivered from our co-packers and warehouses directly to customer warehouses. Some retailers mandate we deliver directly to them, as it is more cost effective and allows them to pass savings along to their customers. Other retailers may not mandate direct delivery, but they recommend and prefer it as they have the capability to self-distribute and can realize significant savings with direct delivery.
Wholesale Distribution
 
Our Wholesale Distributor network handles the wholesale shipments of our products. These distributors have a warehouse and distribution center, and ship Reed’s and Virgil’s products directly to the retailer (or to customers who opt for drop shipping).
International Distribution
 
We presently export Reed’s and Virgil’s brands throughout international markets via US based exporters. International markets where our brands are present are France, UK, South Africa, portions of the Caribbean, Canada, Spain, Philippines, Israel and Australia. In the UK, our Virgil’s brands can be found at Pizza Hut, Tesco Supermarket and Sainsbury.


International sales to some areas of the world are cost prohibitive, except for some specialty sales, since our premium sodas were historically packed in glass, which drives substantial freight costs when shipping overseas. Despite these cost challenges, we believe there are good opportunities to expand internationally, and we are increasing our marketing focus on these areas by adding freight friendly packages such as aluminum cans. We are open to exporting and co-packing internationally and expanding our brands into foreign markets, and we have held preliminary discussions with trading companies and import/export companies for the distribution of our products throughout Asia, Europe, Australia, and South America. We believe these areas are a natural fit for Reed’s ginger products because of the popularity and importance of ginger in international markets, especially the Asian market, where ginger is a significant part of the local diet and nutrition.
 
We believe the strength of our brands, innovation, and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.
 
Distribution Agreements
 
We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors that commit us to “termination fees” if we terminate our agreements early or without cause. These agreements provide for our distributor partners to have the right to distribute our products to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region. As is customary in the beverage industry, if we should terminate the agreement or not automatically renew the agreement, we would be obligated to make certain payments to our distributor partners. We constantly review our distribution agreements with our partners across North America.
 
Some of our outside distributors are not bound by written agreements with us and may discontinue their relationship with us on short notice. Most distributors handle a number of competitive products. In addition, our products are sometimes a small part of our distributors’ businesses.
 
Manufacturing Our Products
 
All of Reed’s products are produced by our co-pack partners, which assemble our products and charge us a fee, generally by the case, for the products produced. We have a long-standing relationship with two co-packers in Pennsylvania. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of our plant, we entered into a three-year co-packing agreement with CCB, whereby CCB will produce Reed’s Inc. beverages in glass bottles at prevailing West Coast market rates. In 2019, we entered into a co-packing agreement with Sonoma Beverage Company on the West Coast. We recently engaged an additional co-packer on the East Coast, Clinton’s Ditch, and another on the West Coast, Noel Canning. We are in discussions and negotiations with additional co-packers to secure added capability for future production needs. We periodically review our co-packing relationships to ensure that they are optimal with respect to quality of production, cost and location.

Warehousing and Logistics are a significant portion of the Company’s operational costs. In order to drive efficiency and reduce costs, on February 1, 2019 we entered into a strategic partnership with Veritiv Logistics Solutions to manage all freight movement for the Company. Veritiv is one of the largest distribution service providers in North America and has expertise that will provide a competitive advantage in the movement of raw materials and finished goods. This partnership will support planning and execution of all inventory movement, assessment of storage needs and cost management.
 
We follow a “fill as needed” model to the best of our ability and have no significant order backlog.
 
New Product Development
 
While we have simplified our business and have streamlined a significant number of SKUs in order to further our primary objective of accelerating the growth of the Reed’s and Virgil’s core product offerings, we believe significant opportunity remains in the all-natural beverage space.
 
Healthier alternatives will be the future for carbonated soft drinks. We will continue to drive product development in the all-natural, no and low sugar offerings in the “better for you” beverage categories. In addition, we believe there are powerful consumer trends that will help propel the growth of our brand portfolio including the increased consumption of ginger as a recognized superfood, the growing use of ginger beer in today’s popular cocktail drinks, and consumers’ increased demand for higher quality, all-natural handcrafted beverages.
 
Christopher J. Reed, the Company’s founder and Chief Innovation Officer continues to support our new product development efforts in 2020. Mr. Reed possesses thirty plus years of product development and innovation experience. Recent innovations include our compelling line of full flavor, all-natural, zero sugar, zero calorie sodas. Reed’s has also begun to expand and broaden its product development capabilities by engaging and working with larger, experienced beverage flavor houses and innovative ingredient research and supply companies.
 
We believe our new business model enhances our ability to be nimble and innovative, producing category leading new products in a short period of time.
 
Competition
 
Nonalcoholic Beverages
 
The nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry is highly competitive, consisting of numerous companies ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Many of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other branding campaigns. Competitors in the ginger beer category include Goslings, Fever Tree, Bundaberg, Cock ‘n Bull and Q Tonic; in the craft soda category we compete with brands such as Stewart’s, IBC, Zevia, Blue Sky, Hansen’s, Henry Weinhard’s, Boylan, and Jones Soda; In the Ginger Ale category we compete with Canada Dry, Schweppes, Seagram’s and Zevia.
 
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising, and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing our products over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the soft drink category could also cause our products to be unable to gain or even lose market share, or we could experience price erosion.
 

10
--


Despite our products having a relatively high price for a craft premium beverage product, minimal mass media advertising to date, and a small but growing presence in the mainstream market compared to many of our competitors, we believe our all-natural innovative beverage recipes, packaging, use of premium ingredients, and a proprietary ginger processing formula provide us with a competitive advantage. Our commitments to the highest quality standards and brand innovation are keys to our success.
 
Shot Category 
 
Our Reed’s Wellness Ginger Shot was introduced during 2020. The shot category is very competitive and a few mainstream companies dominate the category, but there is room for an all-natural alternative. Competition for market share and acceptance of new products is significant. Main competitors are 5-Hour Energy, Ginger Time, and Rescue Ginger Shots.
Candy 
 
Reed’s Craft Crystallized Ginger and Reed’s Ginger Chews restaged their product line up in 2020 and we will be working with a new distribution partner in 2021. The category is small and there is not a significant number of entrants. Key competitors are Chimes and Gin Gins.
Raw Materials
 
Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by Reed’s or by our contract packers in accordance with our specifications.
 
Generally, the raw materials used in our products are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers and many of the materials have multiple reliable suppliers. This provides a level of protection against a major supply constriction or adverse cost or supply impacts. Since our raw materials are common ingredients and supply is easily accessible, we have few long-term contracts in place with our suppliers.
 
Glass Bottles and Aluminum Cans
 
A significant component of our product cost is the purchase of glass bottles and aluminum cans. In December 2017, we entered into an exclusive strategic partnership with Owens-Illinois (glass), and in February 2018 we entered into a strategic partnership with Crown Cork & Seal for aluminum cans. Both suppliers provide expertise in emerging package and material innovation that can be leveraged to further expand marketing and package offerings.
Working Capital Practices
 
Historically, we have financed our operations through public and private sales of common stock, issuance of preferred and common stock, convertible debt instruments, term loans and credit lines from financial institutions, and cash generated from operations. We have taken decisive action to improve our margins, including fully outsourcing our manufacturing process, streamlining our product portfolio, negotiating improved vendor contracts and restructuring our selling prices.
Licensing
 
During 2020 we entered into a licensing agreement with Full Sail Brewery headquartered in Hood River, Oregon to manufacture and sell our new line of Reed’s Alcoholic Moscow Mule in 4 pack, 12 pack, and 16 ounce cans. Full Sail manages all aspects of production and distribution.

Seasonality
 
Sales of our nonalcoholic beverages are somewhat seasonal with a higher than average volume in the warmer months. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.
Proprietary Rights
 
We own copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets relating to our products and the processes for their production; the packages used for our products; and the design and operation of various processes and equipment used in our business. Some of our proprietary rights are licensed to our co-packers and suppliers and other parties. Reed’s ginger processing and brewing process, finished beverage products and concentrate formulas are among its most valuable trade secrets.
 
We own trademarks in the United States that we consider material to our business. Trademarks in the United States are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our manufacturing and bottling agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Reed’s trademarks in connection with their manufacture, sale and distribution of our products. We have registered and intend to obtain additional trademarks in international markets as may become necessary.
 
We use confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, manufacturers and distributors to protect our proprietary rights. Mr. Reed is also subject to an intellectual property agreement with Reed’s restricting competition consistent with his fiduciary obligations to Reed’s.
 
Regulation
 
General
 
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, competition laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.
 
A California law known as Proposition 65 requires a specific warning to appear on any product containing a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:
 

● | below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
● | naturally occurring; 
● | the result of necessary cooking; or 
● | subject to another applicable exemption. 

 
No Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently required to display warnings under this law. We are unable to predict whether a component found in a Company product might be added to the California list in the future, although the state has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine and other natural occurring substances will be evaluated for listing. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended, might result in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a beverage of ours produced for sale in California.

Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use non-refillable, recyclable containers in the United States. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
 
All of our facilities and other operations in the United States are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our primary cost pertaining to environmental compliance activity is in recycling fees and redemption values. We are required to collect redemption values from our customers and remit those redemption values to the state, based upon the number of bottles or cans of certain products sold in the state.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2020, we have 34 full-time equivalent employees on our corporate staff. We employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed. We have never participated in a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are good.
