Organization and Nature of Business
 
The Company was incorporated as Conceptualistics, Inc. on January 6, 1988 in Delaware. Subsequent to its incorporation, the Company changed its name to Eat at Joe’s, Ltd. In February 2015, the Company changed its name to SPYR, Inc. and adopted a new ticker symbol “SPYR” effective March 12, 2015.
 
The Company’s common stock is traded on the National Association of Security Dealers, Inc. (the “NASD’s”) OTC Bulletin Board Under the symbol “SPYR.”
 
The primary focus of SPYR, Inc. (the “Company”) is to act as a holding company and develop a portfolio of profitable subsidiaries, not limited by any particular industry or business.
 
The Company has the following wholly owned subsidiaries:
 

· | SPYR APPS, LLC a Nevada Limited Liability Company;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | SPYR APPS Oy, a Finish Limited Liability Company;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | E.A.J.: PHL, Airport Inc. a Pennsylvania corporation;
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
On March 24, 2015, the Company organized its wholly owned subsidiary SPYR APPS, LLC, (“Apps”) a Nevada Limited Liability Company, and on February 22, 2016, the Company organized its wholly owned subsidiary SPYR APPS Oy, (“Oy”) a Finish Limited Liability Company. The focus of the SPYR APPS subsidiaries is the development and publication of our own mobile games as well as the publication of games developed by third-party developers.
 
Through our other wholly owned subsidiary, E.A.J.: PHL Airport, Inc., we own and operate the restaurant “Eat at Joe’s” ®, which is located in the Philadelphia International Airport and has been in operations since 1997.
 
Beginning May 2015, administrative activities have been conducted from the Company’s corporate headquarters located at 4643 South Ulster Street, Suite 1510, Denver, Colorado. Prior to May 2015, administrative activities of the Company were conducted by corporate officers from either their home or shared business offices located at 670 White Plains Road, Suite 120, Scarsdale, NY 10583.
 
The Company’s lease with the Philadelphia Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the Company’s restaurant is located is scheduled to expire in April 2017. The lease will not be renewed and as a result, the Company is scheduled to close the restaurant concurrent with expiration of the lease in April 2017. The Company’s plan is to divest itself from its restaurant division and is considering spinning off the business, and issuing a stock dividend to its shareholders of record as of May 19, 2017, however, there can be no assurance this can be completed. The Company is also exploring opportunities to license and/or franchise the name “Eat at Joe’s” as well as merger and acquisition targets of other businesses in the food service industries.
 
OPERATING LOSSES
 
The Company has incurred net losses from operations of $7,252,000 and $3,981,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such operating losses reflect developmental and other administrative costs for 2016 and 2015. The Company expects to incur losses in the near future until profitability is achieved. The Company’s operations are subject to numerous risks associated with establishing any new business, including unforeseen expenses, delays and complications. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve or sustain profitable operations.
FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS AND UNCERTAINTY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING
 
Revenues are not yet sufficient to support the Company’s operating expenses and are not expected to reach such levels until the Company completes its expansion plans of building a portfolio of mobile games published and/or developed under its umbrella.
 
In June 2016, the Company obtained an exclusive option to purchase all the assets of the developer of the electronic game commonly known and referred to as “Pocket Starships” (the “Option”). This exclusive Option is exercisable by the

Company at any time, in the Company’s sole discretion, through December 31, 2020, on fixed terms favorable to the Company.
 Since December 17, 2015, the Company has been publishing Pocket Starships through an exclusive publishing agreement (the “Publishing Agreement”) with the game’s former publisher, Spectacle Games Publishing (“Spectacle”). The exclusive Publishing Agreement runs for a term of five years, expiring on December 17, 2020, and provides for the Company to fund advanced development and marketing of Pocket Starships in exchange for 50% of the revenue generated by Pocket Starships, plus a recoupment, out of Spectacle’s share of the revenue, of the development money advanced by the Company. Should the Company decide to exercise the Option, the Company will receive 100% of the revenue generated by Pocket Starships.
 Spectacle is a California corporation that is under common ownership and control of MMOJoe, as defined below. Spectacle maintains a proper registered agent in California, but otherwise has no formal presence in the U.S. The developer and owner of Pocket Starships, MMOJoe UG, maintains its physical offices out of which its employees perform their work at Pintschstrasse 13, 10249 Berlin, Germany and has incorporated a related entity in the U.S. under common ownership and control by the name of MMOJoe USA, a California corporation, which maintains a proper registered agent, but otherwise has no formal presence in the U.S. (collectively “MMOJoe”). All services and work by Spectacle and MMOJoe are performed by employees working out of offices in Berlin, Germany and/or third party contractors overseas. Should the Company decide to exercise the Option, it will pay to MMOJoe $5,000,000 in cash plus $10,000,000 worth of shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at the time of closing of the purchase. In exchange for the Option, the Company granted MMOJoe stock options to purchase an aggregate of 3.75 million shares of common stock with a fair value of $472,000 using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The stock options are fully vested, exercisable at a price per share of $1.00, $2.50 and $5.00 and will expire starting in December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019.
 
The Company may also decide to diversify, through acquisition or otherwise, in other unrelated business areas if opportunities present themselves. The Company may seek additional financing in the future to help fund such expansion and growth. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available at all or available on terms acceptable to the Company.
