Item 1. Business
Our Company
 Our Company designs, manufactures and sells highly engineered turbocharger and electric-boosting technologies for light and commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and the global vehicle independent aftermarket as well as automotive software solutions. These OEMs in turn ship to consumers globally. We are a global technology leader with significant expertise in delivering products across gasoline, diesel, natural gas and electric (hybrid and fuel cell) powertrains. These products are key enablers for fuel economy and emission standards compliance.
 Our products are highly engineered for each individual powertrain platform, requiring close collaboration with our customers in the earliest years of powertrain and new vehicle design. Our turbocharging and electric-boosting products enable our customers to improve vehicle performance while addressing continually evolving and converging regulations that mandate significant increases in fuel efficiency and reductions in exhaust emissions worldwide. 
 We offer light vehicle gasoline, light vehicle diesel and commercial vehicle turbochargers that enhance vehicle performance, fuel economy and drivability. A turbocharger provides an engine with a controlled and pressurized air intake, which intensifies and improves the combustion of fuel to increase the amount of power sent through the transmission and to improve the efficiency and exhaust emissions of the engine. Market penetration of light vehicles with a turbocharger is expected to increase from approximately 51% in 2020 to approximately 55% by 2025, according to IHS Markit (“IHS”), which we believe will allow the turbocharger market to grow at a faster rate than overall automobile production. 
 Building on our expertise in turbocharger technology, we have also developed electric-boosting technologies targeted for use in electrified powertrains, primarily hybrid and fuel cell vehicles. Our products include electric turbochargers and electric compressors that provide more responsive driving and optimized fuel economy in electrified vehicles. Our early-stage and collaborative relationships with our global OEM customer base have enabled us to increase our knowledge of customer needs for vehicle safety, predictive maintenance, and advanced controllers to develop new connected and software-enabled products.
 In addition, we have emerging opportunities in technologies, products and services that support the growing connected vehicle market, which include software focused on automotive cybersecurity and integrated vehicle health management (“IVHM”). Our focus is developing solutions for enhancing cybersecurity of connected vehicles, as well as in-vehicle monitoring to provide maintenance diagnostics, which reduce vehicle downtime and repair costs. For example, our Intrusion Detection and Prevention System uses anomaly detection technology that functions like virus detection software to perform real-time data analysis to ensure every message received by a car’s computer is valid. Our IVHM tools detect intermittent faults and anomalies within complex vehicle systems to provide a more thorough understanding of the real-time health of a vehicle system and enable customers to fix faults before they actually occur. We are collaborating with tier-one suppliers on automotive cybersecurity software solutions and with several major OEMs on IVHM technologies.
 Our comprehensive portfolio of turbocharger, electric-boosting and connected vehicle technologies is supported by our five research and development (“R&D”) centers, 11 close-to-customer engineering facilities and 13 factories, which are strategically located around the world. Our operations in each region have self-sufficient sales, engineering and production capabilities, making us a nimble local competitor, while our standardized manufacturing processes, global supply chain, worldwide technology R&D and size enable us to deliver the scale benefits, technology leadership, cross-regional support and extensive resources of a global enterprise. In high-growth regions, including China and India, we have established a local footprint, which has helped us secure strong positions with in-region OEM customers who demand localized engineering and manufacturing content but also require the capabilities and track record of a global leader.
 We also sell our technologies in the global aftermarket through our distribution network of more than 200 distributors covering 160 countries. Through this network, we provide approximately 5,300 part-numbers and products to service garages across the globe. Garrett is a leading brand in the independent aftermarket for both service replacement turbochargers as well as high-end performance and racing turbochargers. We estimate that over 110 million vehicles on the road today utilize our products, further supporting our global aftermarket business.

Leading technology, continuous innovation, product performance and OEM engineering collaboration are central to our customer value proposition and a core part of our culture and heritage. In 1962, we introduced a turbocharger for a mass-produced passenger vehicle. Since then, we have introduced many other notable technologies in mass-production vehicles, such as turbochargers with variable geometry turbines, dual-boost compressors, ball-bearing rotors and electronically actuated controls, all of which vastly improve engine response when accelerating at low speeds and increase power at higher speeds and enable significant improvements in overall engine fuel economy and exhaust emissions for both gasoline and diesel engines. Our portfolio today includes approximately 1,600 patents and patents pending.
Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings
 On the Petition Date, the Debtors each entered into the RSA and filed a voluntary petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption “In re: Garrett Motion Inc., 20-12212.” 
 On the Petition Date, certain of the Debtors also entered into the Stalking Horse Purchase Agreement with the Stalking Horse Bidder and AMP U.S. Holdings, LLC, each affiliates of KPS, pursuant to which the Stalking Horse Bidder agreed to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, substantially all of the assets of the Debtors. The Stalking Horse Purchase Agreement constituted a “stalking horse” bid that was subject to higher and better offers by third parties in accordance with the bidding procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court in the Bidding Procedures Order. The Bidding Procedures Order permitted third parties to submit competing proposals for the purchase and/or reorganization of the Debtors and approved stalking horse protections for the Stalking Horse Bidder.
 On the Petition Date, we were notified by the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, and in accordance with Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, that NYSE had commenced proceedings to delist our common stock from the NYSE. The NYSE indefinitely suspended trading of our common stock on September 21, 2020. We determined not to appeal the NYSE’s determination. On October 8, 2020, the NYSE filed a Form 25-NSE with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which removed our common stock from listing and registration on the NYSE effective as of the opening of business on October 19, 2020. The delisting of our common stock from NYSE has and could continue to limit the liquidity of our common stock, increase the volatility in the price of our common stock, and hinder our ability to raise capital.
 In accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order, the Debtors held the Auction at which they solicited and received higher and better offers from KPS and the OWJ Group. In addition to the bids received at the Auction from KPS and the OWJ Group, the Debtors also received a transaction proposal in parallel from the CO Group. The Auction was completed on January 8, 2021, at which point the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court (i) an auction notice noting that a bid received from KPS was the successful bid at the Auction but that the Debtors were still considering the proposal from the CO Group, (ii) the Plan and Disclosure Statement. On January 11, 2021, the Debtors, having determined that the proposal from the CO Group was a higher and better proposal than the successful bid of KPS at the Auction, entered into the PSA and announced their intention to pursue a restructuring transaction with the CO Group. As a result of the entry into the PSA, (i) the Debtors filed a supplemental auction notice with the Bankruptcy Court on January 11, 2021 describing the Debtors’ determination to proceed with the Transaction, (ii) the Debtors filed a revised Plan and related revised Disclosure Statement with the Bankruptcy Court on January 22, 2021 to implement the Transaction and (iii) the Stalking Horse Purchase Agreement became terminable, following which, on January 15, 2021, the Stalking Horse Bidder terminated the Stalking Horse Purchase Agreement and the Debtors subsequently paid a termination payment of $63 million and an expense reimbursement payment of $15.7 million to the Stalking Horse Bidder pursuant to the terms of the Stalking Horse Purchase Agreement and the Bidding Procedures Order.
 Under the terms of the PSA and the Transaction, the Plan, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, will include a global settlement with Honeywell providing for (a) the full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of all liabilities under or related to the indemnification and reimbursement agreement with Honeywell entered into on September 12, 2018 (the “Honeywell Indemnity Agreement”), that certain Indemnification Guarantee Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2018 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time), by and among Honeywell ASASCO 2 Inc. as payee, Garrett ASASCO as payor, and certain subsidiary guarantors as defined therein (the “Guarantee Agreement,” and together with the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement, the “Indemnity Agreements”) and the tax matters agreement with Honeywell, dated September 12, 2018 (the “Tax Matters Agreement”) and (b) the dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuits against Honeywell relating to the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement (the “Honeywell Litigation”) in exchange for (x) a $375 million cash payment by the company at emergence from chapter 11 (“Emergence”) and (y) new Series B Preferred Stock issued by the Company payable in installments of $35 million in 2022, and $100 million annually 2023-2030 (the “Series B Preferred Stock”).
 10

In accordance with the terms of the PSA, on January 22, 2021, the Debtors’ entered into the EBCA with the Equity Backstop Parties, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company will conduct the Rights Offering and each Equity Backstop Party committed to (i) exercise its rights, as a stockholder of the Company, to purchase in the Rights Offering shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) purchase, on a pro rata basis (in accordance with percentages set forth in the EBCA), shares of Series A Preferred Stock which were offered but not subscribed for in the Rights Offering.
 On February 15, 2021, the Debtors and the CO Group agreed with certain of the Consenting Lenders to amend and restate the PSA so as to, among other things, add certain of the Consenting Lenders as parties thereto supporting the Plan.
 The Debtors’ entry into and performance and obligations under the PSA and the EBCA are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court and other customary closing conditions. On February 9, 2021, the Equity Committee filed an objection to the Debtors’ motion seeking authority to enter into and perform under the PSA and the ECBA.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled to take place in the Bankruptcy Court on February 16, 2021.  There can be no assurances that the Debtors will obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and complete the Transaction.
 On January 24, 2021, representatives of the Equity Committee submitted a restructuring term sheet for the Atlantic Park Proposal. The Equity Committee subsequently filed with the Bankruptcy Court on February 5, 2021, a proposed plan of reorganization and related disclosure statement with respect to the Atlantic Park Proposal.  The transactions contemplated under the Atlantic Park Proposal have been proposed as an alternative to the transactions contemplated under the Plan. In connection with the Atlantic Park Proposal, the Equity Committee filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to modify the Debtors’ exclusive periods to file and solicit votes on a Chapter 11 plan. The Equity Committee’s motion is scheduled to be heard by the Bankruptcy Court on February 16, 2021. The Company has significant concerns with the feasibility of the Atlantic Park Proposal and has concluded that at this time the transactions contemplated under the Atlantic Park Proposal are not reasonably likely to lead to a higher and better alternative plan of reorganization as compared to the Plan.
 For additional information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases, reorganization, the PSA, the ECBA and the Transaction, see “Explanatory Note” and Note 2, Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings of the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has created unparalleled challenges for the auto industry in the short-term. In the three months ended March 31, 2020, our manufacturing facility in Wuhan, China was shut down for six weeks in February and March and we saw diminished production in our Shanghai, China facility for that same time period, which adversely impacted our net sales for the period. During the second quarter, our facilities in China re-opened, however our manufacturing facilities in Mexicali, Mexico and Pune, India were shut down for five weeks and our manufacturing facilities in Europe operated at reduced capacity. During this time, we implemented a set of hygiene and safety measures that complied with, and in many places exceeded local regulations in order to protect our employees while maintaining commitments vis-a-vis our customers. This combined with the fast recovery observed in all geographies has enabled us to ramp up production in most of our production sites to normal levels in the third quarter of 2020. This trend has been confirmed in the fourth quarter, despite the resurgence of infection rates in U.S. and European Union. If the COVID-19 pandemic drives new lockdown measures impacting our manufacturing facilities, our facilities may be forced to shut down or operate at reduced capacity again. Additional or continued facilities closures or reductions in operation could significantly reduce our production volumes and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Analyst consensus for the full year 2020 anticipates a 17% decrease in global light vehicle production, and for a 10% decline in commercial vehicle production, a larger drop than during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. In 2021, a partial recovery is expected with a rebound of light vehicle production of 14% and commercial vehicles of 6%.  As a result, we estimate that a contraction of approximately 13% for the combined light and commercial vehicle turbocharger industry volume occurred in 2020 and we expect a rebound of 13% in 2021. We have prepared contingency plans for multiple scenarios that we believe will allow us to react swiftly to changes in customer demand while protecting Garrett’s long-term growth potential. The supplies needed for our operations were generally available throughout 2020. In limited circumstances, certain suppliers experienced financial distress during 2020, resulting in supply disruptions.  However, during 2020, we implemented new procedures for monitoring of supplier risks associated with COVID-19 and the Chapter 11 Cases and believe we have substantially addressed such risks with manageable economic impacts

Our Industry
 We compete in the global turbocharger market for gasoline, diesel and natural gas engines; in the electric- boosting market for electrified (hybrid and fuel cell) vehicle powertrains; and in the emerging connected vehicle software market. As vehicles become more electrified, our electric-boosting products use principles similar to our turbochargers to further optimize air intake and thus further enhance performance, fuel economy and exhaust emissions with the help of an integrated high-speed electric motor. By using a turbocharger or electric-boosting technology, an OEM can deploy smaller, lighter powertrains with better fuel economy and exhaust emissions while delivering the same power and acceleration as larger, heavier powertrains. As such, turbochargers have become one of the most highly effective technologies for helping global OEMs meet increasingly stricter emission standards.
 Global Turbocharger market
 The global turbocharger market includes turbochargers for new light and commercial vehicles as well as turbochargers for replacement use in the global aftermarket. According to IHS and other experts, the global turbocharger market consisted of approximately 44 million unit sales with an estimated total value of approximately $10 billion in 2020. Within the global turbocharger market, light vehicles accounted for approximately 90% of total unit volume and commercial vehicles accounted for the remaining 10%.
 Consultants project that the turbocharger production volume will grow at a CAGR of approximately 3% from 2019 through 2025, driven mainly by turbochargers for light vehicle gasoline engines and continued slow growth for commercial vehicles, offset by a decline in diesel turbochargers given a decline in diesel powertrains, particularly for light vehicles. This annual sales estimate would add approximately 372 million new turbocharged vehicles on the road globally between 2019 and 2025.
 Key trends affecting our industry
 Current global economic conditions due to COVID-19 have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect many industries including the Automotive sector. Analysts estimate that automotive industry revenue dropped 11% in 2020, compared to 2019, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. According to the same dataset, other industries that drive, in particular, Off-Highway commercial vehicle turbo demand, such as Oil and Gas (24%), Railroads (16%) or Marine (2%) recorded drops in industry revenue over the same period. Global GDP growth, while restarting in second half of 2020 on the back of global government stimulus programs, will remain 5 percentage points below pre-crisis forecasts at least until 2023, according to the OECD. Consequently, IHS reduced its light vehicle production volume forecast for 2025 from 102 million units that they forecasted in 2019 to 95 million units in their January 2021 light vehicle industry production volume forecast. While this resets the volume outlook for the automotive industry, the underlying growth drivers for the turbo industry remain unchanged: Growth in the overall vehicle industry (albeit from a lower base), increasingly tight fuel efficiency and emission standards, and growing turbocharger penetration.
 Growth in overall vehicle production. After a decrease of 17% in Light Vehicle production and 10% in Commercial Vehicle production in 2020, consultants expect a stabilization in 2021. The global automotive industry is expected to reach pre-crisis volumes in 2022-2023. The shift from pure gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines to hybridized powertrains is expected to continue in response to increasingly strict fuel efficiency and regulatory standards. In parallel, the share of pure electric vehicles is expected to continue to increase from a low base as technology and supporting infrastructure continue to improve. 
 Global vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions standards. OEMs are facing increasingly strict constraints for vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions standards globally. Regulatory authorities in key vehicle markets such as the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, and Korea have instituted regulations that require sustained and significant improvements in CO2, NOx and particulate matter vehicle emissions. OEMs are required to evaluate and adopt various
13

solutions to address these stricter standards. Turbochargers allow OEMs to reduce engine size without sacrificing vehicle performance, thereby increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing harmful emissions. Furthermore, turbochargers allow more precise “air control” over both engine intake and exhaust conditions such as gas pressures, flows and temperatures, enabling optimization of the combustion process. This combustion optimization is critical to engine efficiency, exhaust emissions, power and transient response and enables such concepts as exhaust gas recirculation for diesel engines and Miller-cycle operation for gasoline engines. Consequently, we believe turbocharging will continue to be a key technology for automakers to meet future tough fuel economy and emissions standards without sacrificing performance.
 Turbocharger penetration. The utilization of turbochargers and electric-boosting technologies on vehicle powertrain systems is one of the most cost-effective solutions to address stricter standards, and OEMs are increasing their adoption of these technologies. IHS and other industry sources expect total turbocharger penetration to increase globally from approximately 53% in 2020 to approximately 56% by 2025. IHS forecasts particularly strong turbocharger penetration growth for gasoline turbochargers, expecting an increase from approximately 44% in 2020 to 56% in 2025.
 Medium-Term Powertrain Trends
 

Source: IHS
 Engine size and complexity. In order to address stricter fuel economy standards, OEMs have used turbochargers to reduce the average engine size on their vehicles over time without compromising performance. Stricter pollutants emissions standards (primarily for NOx and particulates) have driven higher turbocharger adoption as well, which we believe will continue in the future, with a predicted total automotive turbocharger sales volume CAGR of 3% between 2019 and 2025, in an industry with a predicted total automobile sales volume CAGR of approximately 1% over the same period, in each case according to IHS and other industry sources. In addition, increasingly demanding fuel economy standards require continuous increases in turbocharger technology content (e.g., variable geometry, electronic actuation, multiple stages, ball bearings, electrical control, etc.) which results in steady increases in average turbocharger content per vehicle.
 Powertrain electrification. To address stricter fuel economy standards, OEMs also have been increasing the electrification of their vehicle offerings, primarily with the addition of hybrid vehicles, which have powertrains equipped with a gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine in combination with an electric motor. IHS estimates that hybrid vehicles globally will grow from a total of approximately 5.3 million vehicles in 2019 to 29.5 million vehicles by 2025, representing a CAGR of 33%. The electrified powertrain of hybrid vehicles enables the usage of highly synergistic electric-boosting technologies which augment standard turbochargers with electrically assisted boosting and electrical-generation capability. Furthermore, the application of electric boosting extends the requirement for engineering collaboration with OEMs to include electrical integration, software controls, and advanced sensing. Overall, this move to electric boosting further increases the role and value of turbocharging in improving vehicle fuel economy and exhaust emissions.
 OEMs are also investing in full battery-electric vehicles to comply with increasingly tight regulatory targets across regions. IHS and other industry sources expect that they will compose 10% of total light and commercial vehicle production globally by 2025.  Consumer adoption hinges on future battery cost – hence vehicle price - reductions, 
 14

increases in power density – hence driving range, and shorter recharging times. As OEMs strive to solve these issues, they are increasing investment in hydrogen fuel cell powered electric vehicles for demanding applications requiring long range, especially in the commercial vehicle space. These vehicles, like battery electric vehicles, have fully electric motor powertrains, but they rely on the hydrogen fuel cell to generate the required electricity. The hydrogen fuel cell also requires advanced electric-boosting technology for optimization of size and efficiency.
 Connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and shared vehicles. In addition to powertrain evolution, the market for connected vehicle services is growing rapidly. According to Strategy&, a consulting firm, this market is expected to grow 34% per annum from approximately $8 billion in 2020 to approximately $35 billion in 2025. Our IVHM, predictive maintenance, diagnostics and cybersecurity tools address this market. Their adoption should increase as advanced driver assistance features and ultimately autonomous driving increase requirements for vehicle functional safety. Simultaneously, our cybersecurity solutions protect those vehicles against outside interference to ensure correct functionality.
 Vehicle ownership in China and other high-growth markets. Vehicle ownership in China and other emerging markets remains well below ownership levels in developed markets and will be a key driver of future vehicle production. At the same time, these markets are following the lead of developed countries by instituting stricter emission standards. Growth in production volume and greater penetration by large global OEMs in these markets, along with evolving emission standards and increasing fuel economy and vehicle performance demands, is driving increasing turbocharger penetration in high-growth regions.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we differentiate ourselves through the following competitive strengths:
 Global and broad market leadership
 We are a global leader in the $10 billion turbocharger industry. We believe we will continue to benefit from the increased adoption of turbochargers, as well as our global technology leadership, comprehensive portfolio, continuous product innovation and our deep-seated relationships with all global OEMs. We maintain a leadership position across all vehicle types, engine types and regions, including:
 Light Vehicles.
  
• | Gasoline: The global adoption of turbochargers by OEMs on gasoline engines has increased rapidly from approximately 14% in 2013 to approximately 40% in 2019 and is forecasted by IHS to increase to 56% by 2025. We have launched a leading modern 1.5L variable geometry turbo (“VNT”) gasoline application, which we believe to be among the first with a major OEM, and we expect to see increasing adoption of this technology in years to come. Key to our strategy for gasoline growth is to leverage our technology strengths in high-temperature materials and variable geometry as well as our scale, global footprint and in-market capabilities to meet the volume demands of global OEMs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Diesel: We have a long history of technology leadership in diesel engine turbochargers. Despite diesel market weakness for some vehicle segments, the majority of our diesel turbochargers revenue comes from heavier and bigger vehicles like SUVs, pickup trucks and light commercial vehicles (such as delivery vans), which remain a stable part of the diesel market. Diesel maintains a unique advantage in terms of fuel consumption, hence cost of ownership, and towing capacity makes it still the powertrain of choice for heavier vehicle applications. Diesel also remains essential for OEMs to meet their CO2 fleet average regulatory target going forward, as diesel vehicles produce approximately 10-15% less CO2, on average, than gasoline vehicles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electrified vehicles. We provide a comprehensive portfolio of turbocharger and electric-boosting technologies to manufacturers of hybrid-electric and fuel cell vehicles. OEMs have increased their adoption of these electrified technologies given regulatory standards and consumer demands driving an expected CAGR globally of approximately 33% from 2019 to 2025, according to IHS. Similar to turbochargers for gasoline and diesel engines, turbochargers for hybrid vehicles are an essential component of maximizing fuel efficiency and overall engine performance. Our products provide OEMs with solutions that further optimize engine performance and position us well to serve OEMs as they add more electrified vehicles into their fleets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commercial vehicles. Our Company traces its roots to the 1950s when we helped develop a turbocharged commercial vehicle for Caterpillar. We have maintained our strategic relationship with key commercial vehicle OEMs for over 60 years as well as market-leading positions across the commercial vehicle markets for both on- and off-highway use. Our products improve engine performance and lower emissions on trucks, buses, agriculture equipment, construction equipment and mining equipment with engine sizes ranging 1.8L to 105L.
 High-growth regions. We have a strong track record serving global and emerging OEMs, including customers in China and India, with an in-market, for-market strategy and operate full R&D and three manufacturing facilities in the high-growth regions that serve light and commercial vehicle OEMs. Our local presence in high-growth regions has helped us win business with key international and domestic Chinese OEMs, and we grew significantly faster than the vehicle production in these regions between 2013 and 2019.
 Strong and collaborative relationships with leading OEMs globally
 We supply our products to more than 60 OEMs globally. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 56% of net sales and our largest customer represented approximately 10% of our net sales in 2020. With over 60 years in the turbocharger industry, we have developed strong capabilities working with all major OEMs. We consistently meet their stringent design, performance and quality standards while achieving capacity and delivery timelines that are critical for customer success. Our track record of successful collaborations, as demonstrated by our strong client base and our ability to successfully launch approximately 100 product applications annually, is well recognized. For example, we received a 2017 Automotive News PACE™ Innovation Partnership Award in supporting Volkswagen’s first launch of an industry-leading VNT turbocharged gasoline engine, which is just one example of our strong collaborative relationships with OEMs. Our regional research, development and manufacturing capabilities are a key advantage in helping us to supply OEMs as they expand geographically and shift towards standardized engines and vehicle platforms globally.
 Global aftermarket platform
 We have an estimated installed base of over 110 million vehicles that utilize our products through our global network of more than 200 distributors covering 160 countries. Our Garrett aftermarket brand has strong recognition across distributors and garages globally, and is known for boosting performance, quality and reliability. Our aftermarket business has historically provided a stable stream of revenue supported by our large installed base. As turbo penetration rates continue to increase, we expect that our installed base and aftermarket opportunity will grow.
 Highly-engineered portfolio with continuous product innovation
 We have led the revolution in turbocharging technology over the last 60 years and maintain a leading technology portfolio of approximately 1,600 patents and patents pending. We have a globally deployed team of more than 1,250 engineers across five R&D centers and 11 close-to-customer engineering centers. Our engineers have led the mainstream commercialization of several leading turbocharger innovations, including variable geometry turbines, dual-boost compressors, ball-bearing rotors, electrically actuated controls and air-bearing electric compressors for hydrogen fuel cells. We maintain a culture of continuous product innovation, introducing about ten new technologies per year and upgrading our existing key product lines approximately every 3 years. Outside of our turbocharger product lines, we apply this culture of continuous innovation to meet the needs of our customers in new areas, particularly in connected automotive technologies. We are developing solutions, including IVHM and cybersecurity software solutions, that leverage our knowledge of vehicle powertrains and experience working closely with OEM manufacturers.
 Global and low cost manufacturing footprint with operational excellence
 Our geographic footprint locates R&D, engineering and manufacturing capabilities close to our customers, enabling us to tailor technologies and products for the specific vehicle types sold in each geographic market. In all regions where we operate, we leverage low-cost sourcing through our robust supplier development program, which continually works to develop new suppliers that are able to meet our specific quality, productivity and cost requirements. We now source more than two-thirds of our materials from low-cost countries and believe our high-quality, low-cost supplier network to be a significant competitive advantage. We have invested heavily to bring differentiated local capabilities to our customers in high-growth regions, including China and India.
 16

In 2020 we manufactured more than 87% of our products in low-cost countries, including seven manufacturing facilities in China, India, Mexico, Romania and Slovakia. We have a long-standing culture of lean manufacturing excellence and continuous productivity improvement. We believe global uniformity and operational excellence across facilities is a key competitive advantage in our industry given that OEM engine platforms are often designed centrally but manufactured locally, requiring suppliers to meet the exact same specifications across all locations.
Our Growth Strategies
 The Debtors, including Garrett, filed for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in September 2020, primarily with the intent to restructure our balance sheet. Given the Company’s operational performance prior to the Petition Date, our day-to-day operations have been largely unaffected. If we are able to timely restructure our balance sheet, and accordingly emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases, Garrett expects to continue to invest in innovative technologies that address the needs of our customers in the ongoing auto industry transformation. This continued investment into differentiated technology, coupled with our relentless focus on deep customer relations and our global capabilities, will allow us to drive the following business strategies:
 Strengthen market leadership across core powertrain technologies
 We are focused on strengthening our market position in light vehicles:
  
• | Gasoline turbochargers, which historically lagged adoption of diesel turbochargers, are expected to grow at an 6% annual CAGR from 2019 to 2025, according to IHS, exceeding the growth of diesel turbochargers. We expect to benefit from this higher growth given the gasoline platforms we have been awarded over the past several years. We have launched the first modern 1.5L VNT gasoline application with a major OEM and we expect to see increasing adoption of this technology in years to come. Key to our strategy for gasoline growth is our plan to leverage our technology strengths in high temperature materials and variable geometry technologies as well as our scale, global footprint and in-region capabilities to meet the volume demands of global OEMs.

• | We believe growth in our share of the diesel turbochargers market will be driven by new product introductions focused on emissions-enforcement technologies and supported by our favorable positioning with large vehicles and high-growth regions within this market. The more stringent emissions standards require higher turbocharger technology content such as variable geometry, 2-stage systems, advanced bearings and materials which increase our content per vehicle. We expect to grow our commercial vehicle business through new product introductions and targeted platform wins with key on-highway customers and underserved OEMs.

 Strengthen our penetration of electrified vehicle boosting technologies
 We stand to benefit from the increased adoption of hybrid-electric and fuel cell vehicles and the increased need for turbochargers associated with increased sales volumes for these engine types. IHS estimates that the global production of electrified vehicles will increase from approximately 7 million vehicles in 2019 to approximately 42 million vehicles by 2025, representing an annualized growth rate of approximately 34%. OEMs will need to further improve engine performance for their increasingly electrified offerings, and our comprehensive portfolio of turbocharger and electric-boosting technologies are designed to help OEMs do so. We expect to continue to invest in product innovations and new technologies and believe that we are well positioned to continue to be a technology-leader in the propulsion of electrified vehicles.
 Increase market position in high-growth regions
 In 2020, after a steep drop in the first quarter due to strict lockdowns, vehicle production in China has experienced a very strong rebound which has partly compensated for the decline in the first quarter, with a full year drop of 5%, compared to 20%+ in other regions. IHS expects vehicle production in China to be stable next year. We plan to continue to strengthen our relationships with OEMs in high-growth, emerging regions by demonstrating our technology leadership through our local research, development and manufacturing capabilities. Our local footprint is expected to continue to provide a strong competitive edge in high-growth regions due to our ability to work closely with OEMs throughout all stages of the product lifecycle including aftermarket support. For example, in China, our research
17

center in Shanghai, our manufacturing facilities in Wuhan and Shanghai and our more than 984 employees support our differentiated end-to-end capabilities and we believe will continue to support key platform wins in the Chinese market. Our operations in China are expected to continue to benefit us as OEMs build global platforms in low cost regions. Our commitment to providing high-touch technology support to OEMs has allowed us to be recognized as a local player in other key high-growth regions, such as India.
 Grow our aftermarket business
 We have an opportunity to strengthen our global network of more than 200 distributors in 160 countries by deepening our channel penetration, leveraging our well-recognized Garrett brand, utilizing new online technologies for customer engagement and sales, and widening the product portfolio. For example, in 2019 we launched a global web-based platform providing self-service tools aimed at connecting garage technicians. In 2020 the platform attracted 170 thousand visitors and 22,000 registered garage technicians who used the platform to complete Garrett self-learning and certification steps.
 Drive continuous product innovation across connected vehicles
 We are actively investing in software and services that leverage our capabilities in powertrains, vehicle performance management, and electrical/mechanical design to capitalize on the growth relating to connected vehicles. More than 85% of passenger vehicles sold in Europe and the United States and almost 50% of vehicles sold in China in 2020 were estimated to be connected in some way to the Internet according to Strategy&, a consultancy firm. According to the same report, that number is expected to reach 100% in Europe and the United States and >90% in China by 2025. Building on the software and connected vehicle capabilities of our Former Parent, we have assembled a team of engineers, software and technical experts and have opened new design centers in North America, India and Czech Republic. We continue to conduct research to determine key areas of the market where we are best positioned to leverage our existing technology platforms and capabilities to serve our customers. We execute a portion of our connectivity investment in collaboration with OEMs and other Tier 1 suppliers and have multiple early-stage trials with customers underway.
 Research, Development and Intellectual Property
 We maintain technical engineering centers in major automotive production regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products, process and manufacturing support to all of our manufacturing sites, and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design developments on a global basis. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,250 engineers. Our total R&D expenses were $111 million, $129 million and $128 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, the Company incurs engineering-related expenses which are also included in Cost of goods sold of $13 million, $5 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
 We currently hold approximately 1,600 patents and patents pending. Our current patents are expected to expire between 2021 and 2040. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in the aggregate, these patents provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property.
 Materials
 The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products are grey iron, aluminum, stainless steel and a nickel-, iron- and chromium-based alloy. As of December 31, 2020, we have not experienced any significant shortage of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules.
 Customers
 Our global customer base includes nine of the ten largest light vehicle OEMs and nine of the ten largest commercial vehicle engine makers.
 18

Our ten largest applications in 2020 were with seven different OEMs. OEM sales were approximately 87% of our 2020 revenues while our aftermarket and other products contributed 13%.
 Our largest customer is Ford Motor Company (“Ford”). In 2020, 2019 and 2018, Ford accounted for 10%, 12%, and 13%, respectively, of our total sales. 
 Supply Relationships with Our Customers
 We typically supply products to our OEM customers through “open” purchase orders, which are generally governed by terms and conditions negotiated with each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers are not required to purchase a minimum amount of product from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related engine platform. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.
 Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program, and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. We manufacture, and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or inventory levels throughout the supply chain.
 Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.
 Regulatory and Environmental Compliance
 We are subject to the requirements of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations in each country in which we operate. These include, among other things, laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
 Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities.
 As of December 31, 2020, the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately $15.6 million. We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and we cannot determine either the timing or the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters, which could be material to our consolidated and combined results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or 
 19

paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial position.
 Additionally, pursuant to the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement, Garrett ASASCO is obligated to make payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of Honeywell’s asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, primarily related to the Bendix business in the United States, as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments and accounts payable, in each case related to legacy elements of the Business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less 90% of Honeywell’s net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of this Honeywell Indemnity Agreement, Garrett ASASCO is responsible for paying to Honeywell such amounts, up to a cap of an amount equal to the Euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate determined by Honeywell as of a date within two business days prior to the date of the Distribution (1.16977 USD = 1 EUR) equivalent of $175 million in respect of such liabilities arising in any given calendar year. The payments that Garrett ASASCO is required to make to Honeywell pursuant to the terms of the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement will not be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Honeywell Indemnity Agreement provides that the agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (x) December 31, 2048 or (y) December 31st of the third consecutive year during which certain amounts owed to Honeywell during each such year were less than $25 million as converted into Euros in accordance with the terms of the agreement. During the first quarter of 2020, Garrett ASASCO paid Honeywell the Euro-equivalent of $35 million in connection with the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement. Honeywell and Garrett agreed to defer the payment under the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement due May 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 (the “Q2 Payment”), however we do not expect Garrett ASASCO to make payments to Honeywell under the Honeywell Indemnity Agreement during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 Under the terms of the PSA and the Transaction, the Plan, if confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, will include a global settlement with Honeywell providing for, among other things, (a) the full and final satisfaction, settlement, release, and discharge of all liabilities under or related to the Indemnity Agreements and the Tax Matters Agreement and (b) the dismissal with prejudice of the Honeywell Litigation in exchange for (x) a $375 million cash payment at Emergence and (y) new Series B Preferred Stock.

Corporate Responsibility
 WeCare4 Sustainability Approach
 Garrett’s mission to enable cleaner, safer vehicles is at the heart of its contribution to society. We develop solutions for the auto industry's most pressing sustainability issues, from emissions reduction to vehicle cybersecurity. Corporate responsibility is therefore a priority for the Company and its Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Board is responsible for promoting corporate responsibility and sustainability as well as monitoring adherence to Company standards. The Board manages oversight of sustainability through a Sustainability Committee, which is comprised of senior leaders in the business who assess and prioritize topics that are material for the business. 
 Garrett articulates its commitments to social and environmental considerations in the communities in which it operates in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct, which can be found on our website at www.garrettmotion.com under “Investors – Leadership & Governance.” 
 The Company intends to publish its first sustainability report in 2021 and to annually report progress on its sustainability commitments.

Human Capital Disclosure
 At Garrett, we place a high value on developing the right working environment and the right skillsets to advance our performance culture, support our growth strategy and ensure that the world at large can continue to benefit from breakthroughs in sustainable mobility. We invest in creating an inclusive, stimulating, and safe work environment where our employees can deliver their workplace best every day. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 6,300 permanent employees and 2,300 temporary and contract workers globally. 
 

Diversity, equity and inclusion
 Diversity and Inclusion is one of Garrett’s four fundamentals. As such, we strive to ensure that our employees are each involved, supported, respected and connected. Embracing diverse thoughts and ideas through inclusion leads to a competitive advantage in the market, increased innovation as we generate new and better ideas, and customer-centric decision making.
 For several years, the Company has supported awareness activities such as unconscious bias training and cultural adaptation assessments to foster an inclusive culture. In 2020, the Company took several steps to strengthen its approach to diversity, equity and inclusion. These include:
  
• | Review of existing diversity and inclusion initiatives;

 Garrett’s Board of Directors had 38% female representation in 2020. 
 Talent Management
 
At Garrett, we encourage our employees to develop their skills and capabilities through a comprehensive Performance and Talent Management system. From annual goal-setting and performance reviews to learning opportunities for employees and leaders, Garrett helps its people align their professional experience with the Company’s business objectives and encourages them to take ownership of their development and career paths.
 Our learning environment offers employees access to more than 1,000 online trainings that address a wide range of functional competencies, technical skills, and human skills. Learning can be self-paced, while Garrett’s growing online peer-to-peer learning communities also allow employees to easily access courses specific to their function and to share materials and ideas on the topics of interest. Dedicated programs support Garrett’s emerging leaders, and these were successfully transformed into virtual learning academies in 2020. Approximately 25,000 hours of training was delivered in 2020.
 Garrett uses regular talent reviews to strengthen the Company’s internal development processes and to calibrate assessment of individual performance.  Twice per year we hold succession planning meetings up to and including the Executive Level during which the bench-strength of teams are scrutinized and development plans for their talent are reviewed.  Ahead of both annual and mid-year performance reviews, leaders hold calibration meetings to ensure that assessment ratings are consistent and fair amongst peer groups.
 Be well, work well
 Health and Safety 
 World-class health and safety considerations are integrated into Garrett’s procedures and processes. Our management systems apply global standards that are currently transitioning from OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001 and that provide protection of human health during normal and emergency situations. Compliance with our standards and local regulatory requirements is monitored through a company-wide audit process. The timely development and implementation of process improvement and corrective action plans are closely monitored. ​​
 From early 2020, Garrett’s global Health and Safety team worked tirelessly to deliver and implement best practice safety guidelines relating to COVID-19. A global safety campaign was rolled out alongside dedicated employee newsletters to support the entire workforce with rules on staying safe and healthy. An ergonomics survey for employees working from home was also deployed to evaluate and drive any corrective measures required.
 The particular focus on the health of our employees to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 also provided a benefit in the focus on their safety with a further reduction in our Total Case Incident Rate (“TCIR”). TCIR is measured as the number of recordable injuries and illnesses multiplied by 200,000 and then that number is divided by the total number of hours worked by employees. TCIR decreased from 0.23 in 2018 to 0.11 in 2019 and then to 0.09 in 2020.

Compensation and benefits
 Garrett’s Rewards programs are rooted in our “Be well, work well” principle, and aim to support employees in achieving the right work-life balance. We invest significant time and resources in establishing compensation programs that are both competitive and equitable. We constantly evaluate our positions for market competitiveness and adjust when necessary with the goal of ensuring the retention of top talent and continuation of equitable pay practices. 
 As part of our commitment to the well-being of our employees, Garrett offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). It is an external counseling service designed to assist employees with personal, family, or workplace matters. This service is confidential and is also available to each employee’s dependents.
 In late 2020, Garrett made a number of well-being resources available to all its connected employees, including useful links and techniques for managing mental and physical health, in addition to dedicated online events.
 Employee feedback, representation, and retention
 Garrett’s Performance Management system aims to ensure that two-way dialogue is ongoing between employees and managers, punctuated by both an annual and a mid-year review, which provides employees the opportunity to express their opinions and ideas in terms of their development goals and career aspirations.
 In 2020, Garrett piloted its first Employee Engagement Survey with a pilot program with one third of its workforce across three continents and achieved a very strong aggregated participation rate of 91%. The Company intends to roll out the Engagement Survey globally in 2021 and to set a baseline engagement score which will be monitored bi-annually.
 Garrett’s strategy is to build positive, direct, business-focused working relationships with all employees in order to drive business results. Garrett respects employees’ rights and their wish to be part of employee representative bodies including unions, work councils and employee forums. The Company understands the value of collective bargaining in its labor and employee relations strategy and the importance of trust in its working relationships. Approximately 40% of the Company’s permanent employees (including both full-time and part-time employees) are represented by unions and works councils under current collective bargaining agreements. 
 Garrett closely monitors employee turnover to measure retention and define improvement actions as and where necessary. As of December 2020, the Company’s annual turnover for 2020 was 9.01%.
 Educating future innovators
 Garrett places a high value on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (“STEM”) research and learning opportunities that provide young people with the skills needed to develop the future of sustainable mobility. The Company sponsors higher education institutes in several countries to further critical research in technical areas and provide students with opportunities to study STEM programs.
 Garrett’s Internship Programs enable students to connect theoretical knowledge with practical responsibilities in the spirit of ‘living laboratories’ during which they are encouraged to take ownership of business projects and define tactics to meet the project goals. Despite the challenging context of COVID-19, Garrett offered 100 internships in 10 countries in 2020.
 Garrett also runs a Graduate Program which in 2020 provided 11 graduates in 3 countries with a unique 2-year opportunity to gain experience and exposure to Garrett’s cutting-edge technologies while at the same time building their leadership skills in a fast-paced and professional work environment.
  The Company sponsors Formula SAE and Formula Student teams in several countries and in 2020 sponsored the European BEST Engineering Competition (EBEC), the biggest international technical competition in Central Europe, where Garrett defined an assignment for 24 students around the concept of sustainable Future Mobility.
 Prior to COVID-19 Garrett teams regularly held open days for school children in their host communities, with a specific focus on encouraging girls to take an interest in STEM. With many host communities forced into lockdown in 2020 Garrett supported local first responders in several countries with the donation of PPE, and also provided food and sanitation products for 2,000 vulnerable families around Garrett’s Indian sites. Garrett is currently working on several projects to support distance learning in its host communities in 2021.

Seasonality
 Our business is typically moderately seasonal. Our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December; our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December; and our Chinese customers often reduce production during the period surrounding the Chinese New Year. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models. Accordingly, our results reflect this seasonality. Our sales predictability in the short term might also be impacted by sudden changes in customer demand, driven by our OEM customers’ supply chain management.
 We also typically experience seasonality in cash flow, as a relatively small portion of our full year cash flow is typically generated in the first quarter of the year and a relatively large portion in the last quarter. This seasonality in cash flow is mostly caused by timing of supplier payments for capital expenditures, changes in working capital balances related to the sales seasonality discussed above, and incentive payments.
 These trends were less significant during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we expect them to continue in the future once the pandemic is resolved.
