ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Organizational History
 
Ameritrust Corporation, a Wyoming corporation (the "Company"), is the successor to Gryphon Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated in Nevada in January 2006 (Gryphon"). Gryphon was originally incorporated under the name Gryphon Oil & Gas, Inc. Gryphon's primary business focus was acquiring and exploring properties for the existence of commercially viable deposits of gold in Canada. In April 2008, Gryphon established a Turkish subsidiary named APM Madencilik Sanayi Ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi. The Turkish subsidiary was sold in September 2010 to an unrelated third party, and all operations in Turkey ceased.
 
Thereafter, Gryphon focused on mineral exploration and continued exploring for gold, silver, copper-porphyry and lithium on two different properties in the state of Arizona. In August 2012, Gryphon filed dissolution documents with the State of Nevada. In 2018, its corporate charter was reinstated and one of Gryphon's shareholders was appointed as custodian. Since that time, it has since been seeking merger targets and has been evaluating various opportunities.
 
In March 2020, Mr. Seong Y. Lee purchased 142,500,000 shares of common stock of Gryphon, representing a majority of the outstanding shares, from Tourmeline Ventures, LLC for $0.0028 per share in cash. The purchase price was paid from personal funds of Mr. Lee and, as result, Mr. Lee became the controlling shareholder. 
 
In April and July 2020, following the change in control, the Board of Directors of Gryphon increased the number of directors on its Board from one to two. Subsequently, the Board voted to appoint Mr. Lee to the vacancy on the Board of Directors and elect him as Chief Executive Officer. The Board also voted to increase the authorized shares to 410,000,000, of which 400,000,000 shares were designated as common stock and 10,000,000 shares were designated as preferred stock, and to effect a 1 for 10 reverse stock split.
 
In March 2020, Gryphon merged into the Company, and each share of Gryphon was converted into one share of the Company.
 
Our Business
 
Subsequent to the change of control in March 2020, the Company began searching for real estate investments, with the goal of acquiring, holding, developing and operating commercial real estate.
Blue Diamond Ranch
 
In July 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain land near Ely, Nevada, including equipment, grazing permits and mineral rights, for approximately $15,000,000. It paid an escrow deposit of $500,000, with approximately $14,500,000 due to the seller at closing. Under the agreement, the deposit is forfeited if due diligence is not completed by December 1, 2020. We failed to close the transaction, and forfeited the $500,000 deposit.
Beespoke Capital Colorado, Inc.
 
In October 2019, before the change in control, we purchased the assets of Beespoke Capital Colorado, a broker-dealer firm ("Beespoke"). Subsequently, the licenses of Beespoke issued by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") expired and the principal officer of Beespoke resigned. Our current management is in the process of renewing such licenses. We converted Beespoke from a limited liability company to a corporation and changed its domicile from Colorado to Connecticut. Pending renewal of regulatory licenses, Beespoke is inactive.
