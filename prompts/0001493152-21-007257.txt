Additionally, on April 24, 2020, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary in Wisconsin called “Altitude Sports Management Corp.,” an entity that will providing fully integrated wealth, health, and career management services to its clients.
 
Further, on January 17, 2021, Altitude International Holdings, Inc. (the “Company” or “Altitude”) entered into a Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with Breunich Holdings, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation (“BHI”). The LOI sets forth the headline terms of a proposed Share Exchange of Altitude with BHI through which 100% of the BHI shares will be exchanged for up to 80% of then-issued and outstanding shares of Altitude.
 
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the LOI, following the Share Exchange, (i) BHI and its subsidiaries will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Altitude; (ii) BHI shareholders would own approximately 80% of the common shares of Altitude, and Altitude shareholders would own approximately 20% of the common shares of Altitude, with such percentages calculated on a fully diluted basis; and (iii) BHI has the right to appoint a majority of the directors of Altitude following the Share Exchange.
 
The completion of the Share Exchange would be subject to the satisfaction of specific conditions set forth in the LOI, including the completion of an audit of BHI and its subsidiaries and the parties first negotiating and executing a definitive Share Exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). These conditions may not ever be satisfied, the Company may never enter into a definitive Share Exchange Agreement with BHI, the Share Exchange with BHI may never be consummated, and even if it is, it may not be consummated on the terms described therein.
 
Competition
 
Currently, the membrane-based technology is not being well used in the United States. In North America, there exist some companies that provide altitude training masks, but the equipment is on a much smaller scale intended for personal use. This type of equipment employs PSA technology, which has reliability issues and a restricted altitude capacity.
 
There have been recent climate-controlled chamber successes in therapy and rehab environments. While used in the United States and North America, much of the membrane-based technology reflects continued use on a more personal basis. The impact of COVID-19 stalled most activities for much of 2020. In recent months, the Company has experienced a renewed interest in the university, college, military, and therapy sectors and professional sports teams.
 
Marketing and Customers
 
Our approach with major professional sports franchises has been an emphasis. Our recent sale to the Orlando Magic, the first sale in the NBA, and the past sales to the Miami Dolphins and Tulane University, corroborate our roll-out efforts for the U.S. professional market. We plan to market to franchise, college, military and therapy institutions interested in installing climate-controlled chambers in their performance facilities indicate renewed momentum for the 2021 season. Our outreach utilizes far-reaching relational capital as the point of entry for prospective targets. Our products and services support junior, adult, and professional individuals.
 
In December 2020, we brought on a new Chairman and CEO, Greg Breunich (“Breunich”). He has a notable career in training, education, and performance, having built IMG Academies from the ground up from 1978-2009 before establishing Club Med Academies located on Florida’s east coast. Breunich’ s initial plan is to add multiple related revenue streams to our business model, transitioning the existing business from a “one-off sale” operation to an entity with multiple year-on-year reoccurring related revenue streams. Breunich and Robert Kanuth, the former Chairman and CEO, reunited Greg Anthony, Professor Greg Whyte, and Dave Vincent to assist with ALTD’s new approach to growth. The team of Greg Breunich, Greg Anthony (former 11-year NBA player and current commentator for NBA TV and Turner Broadcast Network), and Professor Greg Whyte (arguably the foremost sports scientist and public figure on the topic of properly activated Altitude training) place ALTD in a formattable position to expand Altitudes climate-controlled environments in the US Market.

Principal Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business
 
Revised Sporting Edge UK Licensing Agreement
 
Altitude has a Revised Licensing Agreement with Sporting Edge UK that grants a license to Altitude to use Sporting Edge UK’s proprietary technology related to properly engineered, membrane-based designs for simulated altitude training equipment. The annual license fee under the revised agreement is $1.00 per year. The product line ranges from personal at home use machines to fully integrated environmental rooms and chambers. Altitude has the licensing rights to use all technology to manufacture the products and to sell them (directly or through distributors) in the following territories:

● | The Continent of North America, Central America, The Continent of South America. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Other territories as may be agreed from time to time, on a temporary or permanent basis. 

Business Strategy
 
Altitude will transition to a multi-discipline enterprise in 2021, blending income streams from performance-based education, sports, arts, science, and technology. The go-to-market method will be through packaged tuition-oriented services, chargeable support services, actual product system sales. The targeted consumer segments include but are not limited to juniors, adults, professionals. ALTD’s multi-discipline approach consists of wholly owned stand-alone academies, wellness, and manufacturing/assembly facilities. These operations generate reoccurring year-on-year revenue and represent best-in-class high-performance methodology/protocols for training, education, and therapy environments.
Industry Operating Environment
 
We believe the industry operating environment is ready for our products and our focus is climate-controlled rooms. The blended business approach that Altitude has adopted will substantiate our product in the marketplace through education and applied use of our systems and protocols. In the academies’ operations alone, participants attend from 40 nations around the world. Professional athletes and professional teams utilize the facilities from Europe, South America, and Asia.
Development
 
Altitude will be establishing its manufacturing in the United States, taking ownership of our cost to retail structure. Currently, “Made in the USA” carries weight worldwide at the consumer level.
 
The product designs licensed from Sporting Edge UK are proven and cover a wide range of room sizes. The only requirement is to change from metric to imperial sizes where necessary.

There are three unique elements to the Altitude Systems:
 

● | Sophisticated Touch Screen control systems capable of integrating the control of simulated altitude, temperature and humidity. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A unique design of Air Separation Unit with only a single active part that provides for ultra-reliable operation and a design life of greater than fifteen years. 
● | Proven training protocols that allow the desired training benefits to be achieved. 

 
We have included some photos of what our systems look like:
 

Manufacturing consists primarily of the assembly of components into unique licensed designs. In the coming months, a team from the U.K. will come to the States to assist with the setup of our existing manufacturing plant. Initial recruitment of technically capable persons will be necessary, followed by short training blocks to pass on the required skills.

Competition
 
Currently, the membrane-based technology is not being well used in the United States. In North America, there exist some companies that provide altitude training masks, but the equipment is on a much smaller scale intended for personal use. This type of equipment employs PSA technology, which has reliability issues and a restricted altitude capacity. Environment Controlled Systems will ultimately be a must have and become a part of everyday training, rehab and regeneration. The market is not aware of this fact thus the significant upside opportunity for ALTD. As we enter the target market segments and expand the use of our systems the Altitude training will become part of the norm.

The Company does not own any patents directly but has access to the Sporting Edge UK intellectual property through the License Agreement.
