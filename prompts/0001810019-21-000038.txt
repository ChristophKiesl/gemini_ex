ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview
Our Mission
Embrace technology. Empower customers. Deliver the future.
Our Business
We are a leading end-to-end multicloud technology services company. We design, build and operate our customers’ cloud environments across all major technology platforms, irrespective of technology stack or deployment model. We partner with our customers at every stage of their cloud journey, enabling them to modernize applications, build new products and adopt innovative technologies. We serve our customers with a unique combination of proprietary technology resulting from over $1 billion of investment and services expertise from a team of highly skilled consultants and engineers. And we provide our customers with unbiased expertise and technology solutions, delivered over the world’s leading cloud services, all wrapped in a Fanatical Experience.
Cloud technology—the on-demand availability of compute, storage and networking—has revolutionized how companies manage their infrastructure and applications, providing businesses with greater flexibility and lower costs compared to legacy technologies. Over the past several years, businesses have adopted cloud solutions not only to drive cost, scale and reliability benefits, but also to create new revenue opportunities, increase their speed of innovation and compete with digital natives. At the same time, businesses are increasingly turning to the use of more than one cloud solution at a time (which we refer to as multicloud) to enhance performance, ensure redundancy and resilience and provide for increased security, compliance and governance. These trends have accelerated in recent periods as businesses create and adapt to new economic and labor models and are increasingly looking for technologies that enable digital transformation and enhance productivity.
The cloud has become the driver of innovation in the enterprise. At the same time, the number of cloud platforms, the diversity of services offered by each platform and the need to adapt to new paradigms create complexity that requires specialized expertise. Many companies lack the in-house resources to navigate this complexity, thereby limiting their ability to realize the full potential of the cloud. We believe this creates an opportunity for a services partner that enables businesses to fully embrace the power of multicloud technologies and, together, deliver incredible customer experiences.
We aim to be our customers’ most trusted advisor and services partner in their path to cloud transformation and to accelerate the value of their cloud investments. We give customers the ability to make fluid decisions when choosing the right technologies, and we recommend solutions based on customers’ unique objectives and workloads, irrespective of the underlying technology stack or deployment option. In this way, we empower our customers to harness the strength of the cloud.
Over the past nine years, we have invested over $1 billion and 12 million hours to develop a robust and proprietary suite of over 200 technology tools, branded solutions and accelerators for our customers. Our proprietary technology includes automation that ranges from service delivery to self-healing infrastructure, giving us the ability to anticipate and proactively respond to opportunities and threats. This toolset ensures consistency in our customers’ experience and allows our Rackers to automate key service and application management processes, freeing up resources to focus on strategic, high-value business opportunities. This drives an efficient business model that has generated revenue per employee of over $375,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, which we believe is ahead of our competitors and in line with leading software-as-a-service companies. 
Our customers are served by a family of approximately 7,200 Rackers, including some of the most qualified architects and engineers in the world. Our Rackers are at the center of the customer experience—they maintain a hyper-focus on customer experience and satisfaction and are available to our customers 24x7x365 by phone, chat, email or web portal.

We have a culture of innovation that permeates all that we do. Our Rackers gather insights from customers, cloud partners and each other to design, implement and operate some of the most advanced cloud environments. With our deep technical expertise, we build alongside our customers to solve their most complex business challenges and explore their most promising business opportunities. Rackers are on the front lines of cloud technology and are often among the first to utilize the latest capabilities of the cloud when launching new solutions with our cloud partners. Our partnerships, Rackers and culture combine to ensure that we are at the forefront of major trends in technology, including cloud native application development, Internet of Things and containers. This expertise—and our ability to deliver it effectively—enables our customers to innovate faster and stay ahead of their competition. 
Our business benefits from a highly efficient go-to-market strategy given our large installed base of recurring revenue. Our sales efforts are led primarily by a team of over 950 quota-bearing representatives and customer success managers. Our ecosystem of over 3,000 partners serves as an extension of our direct sales force, providing a source of additional new business opportunities. Our customer engagement model begins with our professional services, where we partner with a customer to assess its objectives and design the best cloud strategy to meet its needs, and continues with our flexible recurring service offerings. 
We deliver our services to a global customer base through an integrated service delivery model. We have a presence in more than 60 cities around the world. This footprint allows us to better serve customers based in various countries, especially multinational companies requiring cross-border solutions. We have a strong presence with customers of all sizes, including large global enterprises, mid-market businesses and small and medium businesses ("SMBs"), which we define to be made up of customers with total revenue in excess of $1 billion, between $300 million and $1 billion and less than $300 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our customer base included over 1,000 enterprises, over 1,000 mid-market businesses and over 114,000 SMBs. 
Our success has been recognized by third parties and customers alike. We served over 117,000 customers across 120 countries as of December 31, 2020, including more than half of the Fortune 100. Gartner has recognized us as a Leader in its 2020 report, Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure Professional and Managed Services, Worldwide, for the fourth year in a row. Forrester also recognized us as a Leader in its 2020 report, The Forrester Wave: Multicloud Managed Services Providers, Q4 2020. We have received several industry awards, including VMware’s Global Partner of the Year Award for Social Impact in 2020, Google Cloud’s Specialization Partner of the Year for Infrastructure in 2019 and the Red Hat Innovation Award in 2017. Additionally, we believe we are one of the leading consulting partners for Amazon Web Services ("AWS"), with 15 competencies as of December 31, 2020.
Our Transformation
On November 3, 2016, Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (now named Rackspace Technology Global, Inc., or “Rackspace Technology Global”) was acquired by Inception Parent, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. We refer to the acquisition of Rackspace Hosting, Inc. as the “Rackspace Acquisition.” 
Our predecessor company was founded in 1998. Historically, we focused on providing outsourced, dedicated IT infrastructure. Since the Rackspace Acquisition, we have transformed our business in several ways: 
•Core offerings and service expertise. We have invested in multiple high growth service offerings, including multicloud services, professional services, managed security and data services. In this process, we established one of the broadest partner ecosystems across the technology industry, including infrastructure partners such as AWS, Google, Microsoft and VMware, and application leaders such as Oracle, SAP and others. Additionally, we have made a series of transformative acquisitions to expand our cloud services capabilities and increase our geographic reach.
•Go-to-market. In 2016, our sales process was focused on the sale of a narrow group of point products, most notably our OpenStack Public Cloud and Single Tenant (managed hosting) offerings. Today, our sales process uses a professional services-driven approach, providing holistic multicloud solutions to meet our customers’ objectives and evolving those solutions over the full lifecycle of their cloud journey. We also have increased our focus on serving enterprise customers, which we define as companies that generate $1 billion or more in revenue per year. 
•Investment in proprietary technology and automation capabilities. We have made significant investments to develop proprietary internal systems and tools for our customers. These include automation, artificial intelligence, predictive analytics and proprietary tools that make our services even more reliable and easier to use and extend our advantage over both our competitors and our customers’ ability to replicate these efficiencies on their own.

•Management team. In April 2019, we announced the hiring of our new CEO, Kevin Jones, and, in July 2019, we announced the hiring of our new COO, Subroto Mukerji. In October 2020, we announced the hiring of our new CFO, Amar Maletira. In addition to these executives, we have made additional new hires across the executive leadership team, bringing in new talent with relevant experience across the IT services and technology landscape. Collectively, our executive leadership team benefits from over 150 years of cumulative experience at large technology companies, many with direct experience leading businesses through major transformation initiatives including product introductions and M&A. 
Today, we are a trusted partner to the cloud ecosystem. We maintain close relationships with major cloud infrastructure and application vendors, enabling us to provide our customers with complete, unbiased multicloud services, all through our single customer interface. We no longer actively market our OpenStack Public Cloud service, which once was competitive with hyperscale public cloud platforms and was highly capital intensive, in order to focus our resources on growing our multicloud services portfolio. 
Our transformation has also benefited our financial model in several key ways: 
•We have increased the percentage of our revenue from segments which we believe benefit from attractive growth dynamics. In 2020, over 90% of our revenue came from our Multicloud Services and Apps & Cross Platform segments, which we refer to as "Core Segments". In contrast, in the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, less than 10% of our revenue came from our Cloud Office and Managed Cloud Services service offerings.
•For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from our Core Segments ("Core Revenue") was $2,478.1 million, representing a 15.1% increase on a constant currency basis, and a 15.2% increase on an actual basis, over the year ended December 31, 2019. After giving effect to our acquisition of Onica Holdings LLC ("Onica") in November 2019 as if it had occurred on January 1, 2019, Core Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 9%, on a constant currency basis, over the year ended December 31, 2019. This compares to year-over-year revenue growth of 6%, on a constant currency basis, and 4%, on an actual basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our last reported fiscal year-to-date period as a public company prior to the closing of the Rackspace Acquisition, based on the public company’s core service offerings at such time, which were Single Tenant (managed hosting) and OpenStack Public Cloud, and excluding Cloud Office and Managed Cloud Services.
•We have decreased our capital intensity, which we define as total capital expenditures as a percentage of total revenue, from 16% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, to 8% for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•For the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased Bookings to $1,126.1 million, an increase of 61% as compared to Bookings of $700.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. After giving effect to the acquisition of Onica as if it had occurred on January 1, 2019, Bookings increased 40% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
On August 7, 2020, we completed our initial public offering (the "IPO"), in which we issued and sold 33,500,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $666.6 million from sales of shares in the IPO, after deducting underwriters' discounts and commissions of $36.9 million, but before deducting offering expenses of $8.8 million.
The Rise of Multicloud
Adoption of cloud solutions has occurred in waves over the last decade:
•Early (early 2010s): Early adopters of cloud solutions included various technology leaders and cloud-native businesses. These businesses embraced the novelty of cloud architectures, shifting away from their historical use of legacy on-premises infrastructure and building entire operations and revenue streams on cloud services. 
•Mainstream (mid-2010s): Motivated by the value that cloud technologies unlocked for early adopters, more technology-focused mid-market and enterprise businesses turned to the cloud. Many of these businesses focused on reducing costs and enhancing scale and reliability, but did not embrace the people, process and technology changes required to create new revenue streams and enhance customer experiences. 
- 7 -


•Modern (Present day): Today, businesses are adopting cloud-native principles, embracing agile techniques and adapting their business practices to maximize the benefits of the modern cloud. In addition, more businesses are turning to multicloud solutions to match individual workloads with the best cloud technology stack and the best deployment model; according to Gartner’s survey of public cloud users, "over 80% have adopted a multicloud approach". In response to this need for multicloud solutions, cloud technology vendors that have historically focused on public cloud solutions are offering private cloud solutions to provide maximum flexibility for their customers. Similarly, several technology vendors that have historically focused on private cloud technologies are offering public cloud alternatives. 
As more businesses adopt multicloud technologies, they are faced with an increasing number of complexities, including migration to and between clouds, siloed workloads and defending against increasing security threats. Moreover, more businesses are looking into ways to use their cloud technologies to enhance commercial opportunities and customer experiences and create new avenues for growth. We believe this creates a large and growing opportunity for services partners that are able to offer multicloud services in a way which offers customers the best technologies for their workloads, irrespective of technology stack or deployment model, and enables customers to maximize the value of their cloud investments.
Our Integrated Services Portfolio
We serve our customers through an integrated services portfolio organized in two segments—Multicloud Services and Apps & Cross Platform. The services across these two segments are described in more detail below:
•Multicloud Services: Our Multicloud Services segment includes our public and private cloud managed services offerings, as well as professional services related to designing and building multicloud solutions and cloud-native applications. We offer an integrated suite of managed services offerings across our private cloud, the leading public clouds and colocation. Our managed cloud services help customers determine, manage and optimize the right infrastructure, platforms and services on which to deploy their applications to achieve the best performance, agility, security and cost efficiency. We also help customers establish governance, operational and architectural frameworks to mitigate risks and reduce inefficiencies, so they can manage costs, achieve industry-specific compliance objectives and improve security.
Within our Multicloud Services segment, we offer the following services:
•Private cloud: These service offerings provide compute, storage and applications accessed by a specific customer, either with a cloud management layer (in managed private cloud) or without one (in managed hosting). We offer managed private clouds powered by leading technologies like VMware, Microsoft and OpenStack in our data centers as well as in those owned by customers or by third parties such as colocation providers. We also offer managed VMware on AWS, delivering an increasingly popular hybrid combination. We offer managed hosting in our own data centers, on Linux or Windows servers. Our private cloud offerings can be used with or without virtualization software. Some applications, including high-intensity databases and video games, typically achieve higher performance and cost-efficiency on bare-metal servers. Other applications run better on virtualized servers. Customers who run legacy applications or larger scale modern enterprise applications, and/or have high requirements for security, compliance and control, typically find that private cloud solutions are preferable to do-it-yourself public or private cloud alternatives.
•Managed public cloud: These offerings address the challenges of managing applications and data on the AWS, Microsoft Azure ("Azure") and Google Cloud public clouds. We bundle the underlying public cloud infrastructure with our expertise and experience, managed services and proprietary tools. While the infrastructure providers are responsible for their data centers, servers, storage, networking and operating system software, we help customers navigate, migrate, architect and deploy their applications on those leading public cloud platforms. After a migration, we manage, secure and optimize the customer’s environments on an ongoing basis using our tools, automation and expertise, while supporting the customer with robust service level agreements. These offerings do not require us to commit significant capital expenditures given that third parties provide the infrastructure.
•Apps & Cross Platform: Our Apps & Cross Platform segment includes managed applications, managed security and data services, as well as professional services related to designing and implementing application, security and data services.
- 8 -


•Managed applications: Our managed application services include running large-scale software-as-a-services (SaaS) applications for customers on our and public cloud infrastructure, such as Oracle, SAP and Office 365. This includes key functions such as: managing a customer’s applications and performing key functions such as account management and scaling up or down of required cloud resources. Additionally, we manage productivity and collaboration applications such as email and hosted Microsoft SharePoint.
•Managed security: We provide fully-integrated security solutions that combine cutting-edge technology with our in-house Security Operations Center to provide customers with threat detection, analysis and remediation capabilities. Additionally, we have integrated security platforms into our management tools to give our customers one view of their organization’s vulnerability and threats.
We offer additional managed security services to customers in the areas of (i) security threat assessment and prevention, (ii) proactive threat detection and response, (iii) rapid remediation, (iv) governance, risk and compliance assistance across multiple cloud platforms and (v) Privacy and Data Protection services, including detailed access restrictions and reporting. Our 24x7x365 Customer Security Operations Center is staffed by experienced Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) security analysts.
•Data services: We help customers use their data to further innovate by providing services and expertise for data extraction, transformation, ingestion, storage and analysis. We utilize both traditional analytics platforms and new, machine learning approaches to build repeatable, scalable and automated platforms that extract meaningful insights. Our developers, administrators and cloud and data analytics architects are skilled across a full range of database services, including managed relational databases (Oracle, SAP, SQL Server and MySQL), big data (Hadoop), managed NoSQL (MongoDB) and managed SAP HANA. Our data services are offered both through our managed services subscriptions and through our professional services offerings.
We deliver professional services across our entire portfolio, including multicloud solutions, applications, security and data. As part of our professional services process, we meet customers at every stage of their cloud journey and design solutions focused on modernizing their infrastructure and applications to enhance the value of their cloud technologies. This process often serves as the starting point for new business opportunities; following our initial professional services engagement, a customer will typically use any combination of our managed services under long-term contracts, and will often use our professional services multiple times as their technology needs continue to evolve.
In addition to our integrated services portfolio described above, we also offer customers our OpenStack Public Cloud solution, our third reporting segment. This offering appeals to customers who (i) want to run applications on a public cloud that is built on open-source technology with no risk of vendor lock-in; (ii) value the expertise and exceptional customer service for which we are renowned; and (iii) want their public cloud and managed hosting platforms to work smoothly together, through technologies such as our proprietary RackConnect tool. While we expect to continue to offer our OpenStack Public Cloud solution, we ceased to actively market it to customers in 2017.
Our Technology Platform
Our technology platform is at the center of the Fanatical Experience that we deliver to customers. Our technologies focus on removing the complexities of multicloud deployments, unifying compelling aspects of the experience for our customers and enabling us to deliver scalable solutions.
•Innovative automation drives efficiency for us and our customers, enabling us to rapidly and consistently deliver our solutions across multiple products and clouds at scale. Rackspace Business Automation is a custom platform developed to handle over 11 million events and over 1 billion actions per month across physical devices, virtual devices, systems and tools; data center automation provides services and applications to automate provisioning, configuring and the decommissioning of data center infrastructure; and UIPath Robotic Process Automation is deployed across our business to automate repetitive tasks. We can automate 75% of customer support workloads based upon the automation of thousands of unique processes across our support organization.
•AIOps is a new field of software that combines monitoring, machine learning and automation to enhance IT operations. Our AIOps platform correlates monitoring events across our customers’ physical and virtual devices into a single incident or problem, significantly reducing the time to resolution for complex incidents. We developed a first of its kind multi-tenant AIOps solution that processes millions of compliance-related events each month.
•Predictive operations enables our data scientists to build sophisticated models to provide actionable insights to our business leaders, increasing our agility and ability to identify opportunities that enhance our customer relationships.

•Self-service APIs enable our customers to access data and resources programmatically, extending our automation and service delivery into their native tools and processes. We support integration with our ticketing systems to enable two-way integrated support workflows, and billing system integration to enable access to consolidated billing data in multicloud environments. Additionally, our pre-built integration with ServiceNow enables enterprise customers to simplify connectivity between our tools and ServiceNow.
•MyRackspace and other portals and associated mobile apps service over 600,000 active monthly users and support product specific self-service, insights, account management, security management, ticketing and billing. The portals are unified with our custom framework and design language, Pilot and Helix, providing a consistent experience and integrated navigation between our product lines and features. Our custom identity management system authenticates access to our user interfaces and APIs, handling over 1.8 billion requests per month. This includes federation capabilities to integrate with our customers’ identity providers.
•Unified billing enables us to deliver an integrated single invoice for customers across all multicloud deployments. Our systems extract and rerate bills from public cloud hyperscalers and merge data from our products and services to generate a single invoice each month, while applying sophisticated billing and discount models.
•Service management applications ensure scale, speed, quality and consistency in our service delivery. These applications, including our custom CORE and Encore tools, support configurable rules and routing engines, integrated escalation management, detailed queue management and management visibility and reporting. These tools are augmented with sophisticated workforce management solutions to manage work shifts by utilizing historical data and trends across ticketing, chat and telephony, to maintain and appropriately staff our 24x7x365 operations.
Our Differentiation
We offer solutions that are differentiated from our peers and drive a continuous cycle of product innovation and product development, while delivering a Fanatical Experience. These solutions both enable and are enabled by several key factors:
Focus on delivering strategic outcomes: Our value proposition to customers includes a focus on solving strategic business problems, rather than selling a product or group of products in a point sale. Our customers are able to use our services to drive new revenue streams and enhance the value of their cloud investments, which may include collecting data to create new product offerings and applications, connecting workloads between clouds or automatically scaling cloud usage to match demand. This has resulted in a growth opportunity within our customer base; the number of customers that contributed over $1 million to our revenue in a given fiscal year increased at a compound annual growth rate of 24% between 2017 and 2020. 
Unified service experience for the multicloud: We have developed Rackspace Fabric, a multi-tenant, end-to-end service management platform enabling our customers to access all of our supported clouds and all of our managed services from a single, web-based interface. This technology provides customers with a toolkit to including unified billing, a central security model, unified ticketing and support interactions. This technology provides our customers with a consistent experience across all clouds and enables us to deliver a scalable and efficient means of offering our Fanatical Experience to over 117,000 customers worldwide. 
Unparalleled service expertise: Our business benefits from a family of approximately 7,200 Rackers, with qualifications that span across all of the major technology stacks and cloud solutions used by our customers, including AWS, Google Cloud, Azure and VMware. This expertise provides our clients with services expertise at a level we believe to be unmatched by our peers and allows us to sustain our competitive advantage over competing technology vendors.
Efficient go-to-market enabled by close customer relationships: Our go-to-market model includes an integrated direct sales platform led by our team of over 350 sales representatives and over 600 service delivery managers. Following an initial deployment, we are constantly engaged with our customers, proactively looking for opportunities to enhance the value of their cloud investments and evolving our solutions with their needs over time. This approach provides customers with a single trusted advisor across all cloud environments, irrespective of technology stack or deployment option. Our close customer and partner relationships drive an efficient go-to-market strategy, with sales efficiencies we believe are unmatched by competing companies. Recurring revenue comprised 95% of our revenue in 2020. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, among our customers with Annual Recurring Revenue of over $100,000 (a group which comprised over 75% of our revenue), approximately 50% were using multiple services. 
- 10 -


Differentiated relationships with technology partners: We benefit from differentiated partnerships with major public and private cloud vendors, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and VMware. We work with our partners’ sales teams to offer bundled solutions through a single go-to-market effort. Additionally, we have insight into our partners’ product roadmaps (and vice versa), providing critical inputs for both sides to develop complementary services and technology. We believe these relationships are beneficial to us, our customers and our partners; we and our partners both receive critical inputs for further innovation and benefit from joint go-to-market initiatives, while our customers are able to maximize their use of innovative technologies more efficiently, reduce time-to-market and remain competitive. 
Customizable consumption of services: Our service model enables customers to adapt their consumption of our services with the evolving needs of their businesses. Rackspace Service Blocks are packages of services tailored to address specific cloud use cases and enable a customized consumption model whereby customers can match their cloud needs with the associated spend. Rackspace Service Blocks allow our customers to maintain greater agility, performance and cost-efficiency as compared to traditional IT services contracts. Additionally, this structure provides us with a platform for cross-sell and up-sell opportunities with customers over time, resulting in a land-and-expand model in which customers increase their use of our services as their cloud needs evolve. 
Fanatical Experience: The Fanatical Experience that we deliver to our customers is the foundation of the trust our customers place in us when they choose us to build, manage and operate their cloud environments. That process encompasses everything from the way we recruit, interview and test prospective employees; to the way we continuously train new and veteran employees in the latest technologies; to the way we make the specialized expertise of global Rackers available to customers 24x7x365 by phone, chat, email or web portal; to the way we empower Rackers to invest in new research and development projects; to our hyperfocus on customer experience and satisfaction; and to the way we leverage automation and proprietary tools and processes to make our services highly reliable and easy for our customers to use. We use monitoring tools to perform over 4 million checks of our customers’ cloud environments every five minutes to proactively identify issues and take action, and we receive over 600,000 monthly customer knowledge-based visits to our website. This has resulted in compelling metrics for us, including an average NPS of 50 for the three-month period ended December 31, 2020, indicative of the quality of our customer experience.
Our Growth Strategies
In order to continue to drive growth and capture our large market opportunity, key elements of our growth strategies include: 
Continue to innovate: We are a leader in cloud services across multicloud environments and will continue to invest in and grow our expertise and service offerings in major technology ecosystems such as cybersecurity, big data, containers, serverless computing and the Internet of Things. However, our market share within the overall cloud industry remains relatively low, providing us with significant opportunity to increase wallet share from both new and existing customers. We intend to continue to add new technology capabilities and professional services expertise in order to best serve our customers and increase revenue from new and existing customers. 
Drive sales execution: We plan to continue executing on several sales initiatives that are designed to drive continued growth in our business. These include investment in our sales force productivity measures, greater focus on opportunities with enterprise customers and larger deal sizes. 
Expand geographic reach: We believe there is significant need for our solutions on a global basis and, accordingly, opportunity for us to grow our business through further international expansion as these markets increase their use of multicloud solutions. As a result, we have made significant investments in expanding our presence in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific and Japan (“APJ”). As of December 31, 2020, over 1,200 and 1,600 of our employees were based in EMEA and APJ, respectively. We intend to add international sales team members to take advantage of this market opportunity while refining our go-to-market approach based on local market dynamics. 
Leverage and expand our partner ecosystem: We benefit from close relationships with our cloud partners, allowing us to provide comprehensive multicloud services to our customers, and providing us with a source of new business opportunities and inputs for future product roadmaps. Additionally, we maintain the highest levels of partner status with the leading cloud partners. We intend to expand relationships with existing partners and build on new ones. 
- 11 -


Pursue strategic acquisitions: We benefit from a strong platform for integrating complementary capabilities and service offerings. We have a disciplined and selective approach for evaluating new acquisition opportunities, and our management team has significant experience integrating acquired targets. We intend to continue to explore potential transactions that could enhance our capabilities, increase the scope of our technology footprint or expand our geographic reach.
Our Competition
We believe our technology and services expertise positions us well to compete with other technology and services providers. We face competition primarily from: 
•In-house IT departments of our customers and potential customers provide services for their respective organizations, but typically need help scaling large technology environments and maximizing the value from their cloud investments, especially when speed, cost and innovation are key constraints. 
•Traditional global IT systems integrators, such as Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, DXC Technology and IBM, offer consulting and outsourcing, in a labor intensive model, for large enterprise customers. Many of these businesses largely support legacy technologies and, where cloud capabilities exist, legacy revenue streams disincentivize these companies from fully embracing cloud technologies. 
•Cloud service providers and digital systems integrators provide either consultation and implementation services for digital workflows or cloud services for a single cloud vendor. The solutions offered by these companies are often narrow in scope, and are not well suited for companies with complex multicloud objectives. 
•Regional managed services providers use a local go-to-market approach, and provide cloud services within a single region or few regions. These companies are unable to serve the full needs of multinational customers. 
•Colocation providers, such as Equinix, CyrusOne and QTS, provide secure environments for hardware and access to network connectivity. We believe that these companies provide limited services differentiation, and their customers do not benefit from the economics of cloud-based technologies.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include, but are not limited to: 
•Focus on the cloud 
•Technology and services expertise
•Customer experience
•Speed of innovation
•Strength of relationships with technology partners 
•Automation and scalability 
•Standardized operational processes 
•Geographic reach 
•Brand recognition and reputation 
•Price 
We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. However, many of our competitors have: substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources; relationships with large vendor partners; larger global presence; larger customer bases; longer operating histories; greater brand recognition; and more established relationships in the industry than we do. Furthermore, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter the market through acquisitions, partnerships or strategic relationships.

Our Approach to Partnerships
We benefit from differentiated partnerships with all major public and private cloud vendors, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and VMware. These partnerships provide us with a competitive advantage unmatched by our competitors, spanning across multiple disciplines, including:
•Comprehensive Alignment: We work with major technology partners through a systematic engagement model across six key areas of our business: executive, alliances, solutions, marketing, sales and service delivery, to ensure alignment on key initiatives. We operate strategic programs that include solutions milestones, performance reviews and long-term strategic initiatives. 
•New business opportunities: Our sales teams and pre-sales engineering experts work with sales teams at technology partners to offer bundled solutions through a combined go-to-market effort. This results in a more compelling value proposition and greater value for our mutual customer. We believe our partners view us as a top services partner for their cloud technologies, as we are often cited as a ‘go-to’ services vendor for new business opportunities. 
•Innovative Solutions: We work closely with our partners’ product engineering teams as the baseline for our roadmap development and to provide input into our partners’ development plan. This critical input allows both us and our partners to develop complementary services and technology. This has enabled us to stay at the forefront of innovation well before our competitors and develop services and tools around emerging technologies such as cloud-native application development, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
We believe these relationships are beneficial to us, our partners and our customers. We and our partners both receive critical inputs for further innovation and benefit from joint go-to-market initiatives, while our customers are able to maximize their use of innovative technologies more efficiently, reduce time-to-market and remain competitive.

Sales and Marketing
Our services are sold via a global direct sales teams of over 350 sales representatives and over 600 service delivery managers as of December 31, 2020, through third-party channel partners and through online orders on our website. Our sales model is based on both distributed and centralized sales teams with leads generated from customer referrals, channel partners and corporate marketing efforts. 
Professional services are at the core of our consultative sales model and often serve as the gateway to our platform. For new business opportunities, our professional services organization engages closely with a customer to assess and design the best cloud solution for that customer. This is often the first step toward a long-term services agreement with a customer where we manage a customer’s cloud operations and give them the flexibility to evolve their spend with us as their needs change over time. 
Our network of 3,000 channel and technology partners as of December 31, 2020 also plays an important role in our sales efforts. Our channel partners, including management and technical consultancies, technology integrators, software application providers, value-added resellers and web developers, serve as a source of new business opportunities, primarily for small and medium-sized customers. Our technology partners serve as an extension of our sales force, often leading to new business opportunities as their customers recognize the need for a services partner to make the best use of their technology investments. In some cases, we collaborate directly with these partners on go-to-market efforts. 
Our Customer Success team includes over 600 Rackers and engages in client relationship, contract management, managing deliverables, client retention, and growth of our install base. This team is responsible for understanding the existing customers’ changing business needs and translating them into IT requirements, resulting in successful project execution or alignment of our other service offerings. 
We have a full life cycle marketing plan that leverages a mix of initiatives. Our goal is market awareness of the unique value we bring to our customers in an ever-changing multicloud world. Through a series of automation and digital experiences, we provide awareness of our multicloud expertise, vast partner network, proven leadership and customer success-driven culture that thrives on Fanatical Experience. We leverage customer success stories to best describe how we work with customers and partners to produce compelling content. Our global brand marketing, Solving Together, is focused on thought leadership, media and public relations, virtual and in-person event marketing, an interactive social media plan, search engine optimization and digital advertising to drive awareness and credibility. Our global website is published in four languages across 20 regions and serves as our window to the market. For our solution marketing initiatives, we have a mix of digital display advertising, nurture automation, content syndication, social media and webinars to nurture our vast customer base for cross sell/upsell opportunities. Our experts participate in worldwide speaking engagements and contribute to several media outlets, always alongside our customers and partners.
Our Culture
At the heart of our customers’ Fanatical Experience is our unique culture.
At Rackspace Technology, we invest in the recruitment, development and retention of our Rackers. Inclusion and diversity is a top priority for our company; we cultivate top talent from around the world with diverse backgrounds and a range of expertise. We are highly selective in hiring the best talent, hiring less than 2% of all applicants, to ensure our employees are not just technical experts, but obsessed with customer outcomes and delivering Fanatical Experience. 
We offer Rackers’ various professional development opportunities through Rackspace University, along with award winning Onboarding and Leadership development programs, enabling them to enhance their capabilities across technologies and further their professional growth. Additionally, we are regularly recognized as a best place to work by Great Place to Work Institute, Fortune, Forbes, Glassdoor, Military Times, and the Human Rights Foundation Best Places to Work for LGBTQ and more. Our culture and focus on Rackers’ development has resulted in a strong annualized employee retention rate of over 87% for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Our Rackers are passionate about serving our communities as well. Rackspace Technology provides 24 hours of paid time for each Racker to volunteer, with over 15,000 volunteer hours logged for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Rackspace Foundation, a Racker-funded nonprofit organization, has contributed over $6.6 million to date in support of education improvements in local schools.

Our Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 7,200 Rackers in 16 countries, including 4,300 Rackers in North America, 1,200 Rackers in EMEA, 1,600 in APJ and 100 Rackers in Australia and New Zealand. Of our North American Rackers, approximately 1,900 work from our corporate headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 25% of all Rackers were classified as work-from-home. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws in the U.S., the European Union, the U.K. and various countries in Asia and South America, along with contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including with respect to our data offerings and services. However, these laws and contractual restrictions provide only limited protection. For example, we do not have any patent rights related to our proprietary tools, technology, processes and systems, including Rackspace Fabric, and rely on confidentiality agreements to protect such proprietary rights. 
We have trademarks registered or pending in the U.S., the European Union and various countries in Asia and South America for our name and certain words and phrases that we use in our business, and we rely on copyright laws and licenses to use and protect software and certain other elements of our proprietary technologies. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we actively monitor access to our proprietary technologies. In addition, we license third-party software, open source software and other technologies that are used in the provision of or incorporated into some elements of our services. Many parts of our business are significantly reliant on proprietary technology and/or licensed technology, including open source software. 
We have patents issued as well as patent applications pending in the U.S. and the European Union, primarily related to our historical, legacy offerings such as OpenStack Public Cloud. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow the scope of the claims sought. Our issued patents, and any future patents issued to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. 
Although we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop services that compete with ours. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies or services that are competitive with ours or that infringe on, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated. Our use of open source software, and participation in open source projects, may also limit our ability to assert certain of our intellectual property and proprietary rights against third parties, including competitors, who access or use software or technology that we have contributed to such open source projects. 
Furthermore, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available, as the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights are uncertain and still evolving. 
Companies in the software industry or non-practicing entities may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property and proprietary rights, and these companies and entities may in the future request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of their intellectual property and proprietary rights. Any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. 
See Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors - "Risks Related to Our Business" for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our use of open source software.
