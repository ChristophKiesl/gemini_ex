ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Company Description and Development of the Business
The discussion below provides a brief description of the business conducted by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (“Scotts Miracle-Gro” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we” or “us”), including general developments in the Company’s business during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 (“fiscal 2017”). For additional information on recent business developments, see “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry. Our key brands include Scotts® and Turf Builder® lawn and grass seed products; Miracle-Gro®, Nature’s Care®, Scotts®, LiquaFeed® and Osmocote®1 gardening and landscape products; and Ortho®, Roundup®2, Home Defense® and Tomcat® branded insect control, weed control and rodent control products. We are the exclusive agent of the Monsanto Company (“Monsanto”) for the marketing and distribution of consumer Roundup® non-selective weedkiller products within the United States and certain other specified countries. We have a presence in similar branded consumer products in China and Latin America. In addition, with our acquisitions of Gavita Holdings B.V. (“Gavita”), General Hydroponics, Inc. (“General Hydroponics”), Bio-Organic Solutions, Inc. (“Vermicrop”), American Agritech, L.L.C. (“Botanicare”), Agrolux Holding B.V. (“Agrolux”), AeroGrow International, Inc. (“AeroGrow”) and Can-Filters Group Inc. (“Can-Filters”), we are a leading producer of liquid plant food products, growing media, advanced indoor garden, lighting and ventilation systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. 
Prior to August 31, 2017, we operated consumer lawn and garden businesses located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom (the “International Business”). On April 29, 2017, the Company received a binding and irrevocable conditional offer (the “Offer”) from Exponent Private Equity LLP (“Exponent”) to purchase the International Business. On July 5, 2017, the Company accepted the Offer and entered into the Share and Business Sale Agreement (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”) contemplated by the Offer. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Scotts-Sierra Investments LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries entered into separate stock or asset sale transactions with respect to the International Business. The Company’s sale of the International Business to Exponent closed on August 31, 2017.
Prior to April 13, 2016, we operated the Scotts LawnService® business (the “SLS Business”), which provided residential and commercial lawn care, tree and shrub care and pest control services in the United States. On April 13, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) between the Company and TruGreen Holding Corporation (“TruGreen Holdings”), we completed the contribution of the SLS Business to a newly formed subsidiary of TruGreen Holdings (the “TruGreen Joint Venture”) in exchange for a minority equity interest of approximately 30% in the TruGreen Joint Venture. We now participate in the residential and commercial lawn care, tree and shrub care and pest control services segments in the United States and Canada through our interest in the TruGreen Joint Venture.
Scotts Miracle-Gro, an Ohio corporation, traces its heritage back to a company founded by O.M. Scott in Marysville, Ohio in 1868. In the mid-1900s, we became widely known for the development of quality lawn fertilizers and grass seeds that led to the creation of a new industry-consumer lawn care. In the 1990s, we significantly expanded our product offering with three powerful leading brands in the U.S. home lawn and garden industry. First, in fiscal 1995, through a merger with Stern’s Miracle-Gro Products, Inc., which was founded by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in Long Island, New York in 1951, we acquired the Miracle-Gro® brand, the industry leader in water-soluble garden plant foods. Second and third, in 1998, we acquired the Ortho® brand in the United States and obtained exclusive rights to market the consumer Roundup® brand within the United States and other contractually specified countries, thereby adding industry-leading weed, pest and disease control products to our portfolio. Today, we believe that Scotts®, Turf Builder®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho® and Roundup® are among the most widely recognized brands in the consumer lawn and garden industry in the United States.
Our strategy is focused on (i) growing our core branded business, primarily in North America where we can leverage our competitive advantages in emerging areas of growth including organics, hydroponics, live goods, water positive landscapes, and internet-enabled technology, (ii) maximizing the value of non-core-assets including the divestiture of Scotts LawnService® and

the International Business, and (iii) cash flow including near-term investments that will drive long-term growth, a natural mid-term shift to integration of acquired businesses, and a long-term plan to return increasing amounts of cash to shareholders.
Business Segments
We divide our business into the following reportable segments:

• | U.S. Consumer


• | Hawthorne


• | Other

This division of reportable segments is consistent with how the segments report to and are managed by our Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision-maker of the Company). Financial information about these segments for each of the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented in “NOTE 22. SEGMENT INFORMATION” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
These segments differ from those used in prior periods due to the change in our internal organization structure resulting from our divestiture of the International Business, which closed on August 31, 2017. As a result, effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we classified our results of operations for all periods presented to reflect the International Business as a discontinued operation and classified the assets and liabilities of the International Business as held for sale. See “NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS” for further discussion. Prior to being reported as a discontinued operation, the International Business comprised a substantial proportion of the Europe Consumer and Other reportable segments. Refer to “NOTE 22. SEGMENT INFORMATION” for discussion of our new reportable segments effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
Principal Products and Services
In our reportable segments, we manufacture, market and sell lawn and garden products in the following categories:
Lawn Care: The lawn care category is designed to help users obtain and enjoy the lawn they want. Products within this category include lawn fertilizer products under the Scotts® and Turf Builder® brand names; grass seed products under the Scotts®, Turf Builder®, EZ Seed®, Water Smart® and PatchMaster® brand names; and lawn-related weed, pest and disease control products primarily under the Scotts® brand name, including sub-brands such as GrubEx®. The lawn care category also includes spreaders and other durables under the Scotts® brand name, including Turf Builder® EdgeGuard® spreaders, Snap® spreaders and Handy Green® II handheld spreaders. In addition, we market outdoor cleaners under the Scotts® OxiCleanTM3 brand name. 
Gardening and Landscape: The gardening and landscape category is designed to help consumers grow and enjoy flower and vegetable gardens and beautify landscaped areas. Products within this category include a complete line of water-soluble plant foods under the Miracle-Gro® brand and sub-brands such as LiquaFeed®, continuous-release plant foods under the Miracle-Gro®, Scotts® and Osmocote® brands and sub-brands of Miracle-Gro® such as Shake ‘N Feed®; potting mixes and garden soils under the Miracle-Gro®, Scotts®, Hyponex®, Earthgro®, SuperSoil® and Fafard® brand names; mulch and decorative groundcover products under the Scotts® brand, including the sub-brands Nature Scapes®, Earthgro® and Hyponex®; plant-related pest and disease control products under the Ortho® brand; organic garden products under the Miracle-Gro® Organic Choice®, Nature’s Care®, Scotts®, Whitney Farms® and EcoScraps® brand names; and live goods and seeding solutions under the Miracle-Gro® brand and Gro-ables® sub-brand. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into a Marketing, R&D and Ancillary Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) and a Term Loan Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) with Bonnie Plants, Inc. (“Bonnie”) and its sole shareholder, Alabama Farmers Cooperative, Inc. (“AFC”), pursuant to which we provide financing and certain services to Bonnie’s business of planting, growing, developing, manufacturing, distributing, marketing, and selling to retail stores throughout the United States live plants, plant food, fertilizer and potting soil (the “Bonnie Business”). See “Acquisitions” for further discussion.
Hydroponics: This category is designed to help users grow plants, flowers and vegetables in an indoor or urban environment using little or no soil.

Controls: The controls category is designed to help consumers protect their homes from pests and maintain external home areas. Insect control products are marketed under the Ortho® brand name, including Ortho Max®, Home Defense Max® and Bug B Gon Max® sub-brands; rodent control products are marketed under the Tomcat® and Ortho® brands; selective weed control products are marketed under the Ortho® Weed B Gon® and Roundup® for Lawns sub-brands; and non-selective weed control products are marketed under the Roundup® and Groundclear® brand names. 
Marketing Agreement: We are Monsanto’s exclusive marketing agent for consumer Roundup® non-selective weedkiller products in the United States and certain other specified countries. On May 15, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Exclusive Agency and Marketing Agreement (the “Original Marketing Agreement”) with Monsanto and also entered into a lawn and garden brand extension agreement (the “Brand Extension Agreement”) and a commercialization and technology agreement (the “Commercialization and Technology Agreement”) with Monsanto. On August 31, 2017, in connection with the sale of the International Business, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Agency and Marketing Agreement (the “Restated Marketing Agreement”) and the Amended and Restated Lawn and Garden Brand Extension Agreement - Americas (the “Restated Brand Extension Agreement”) to reflect the Company’s transfer and assignment to Exponent of the Company’s rights and responsibilities under the Original Marketing Agreement, as amended, and the Brand Extension Agreement relating to those countries and territories subject to the sale.
Under the terms of the Restated Marketing Agreement, we are jointly responsible with Monsanto for developing consumer and trade marketing programs for consumer Roundup® non-selective weedkiller products in the countries where we serve as agent. We also provide sales, merchandising, warehousing and other selling and marketing support for these products. The Company performs other services, including manufacturing conversion services, pursuant to ancillary agreements. The Restated Brand Extension Agreement provides the Company an exclusive license in each country throughout the North American continent, South American continent, Central America, the Caribbean, Israel and China to use the Roundup® brand on additional products offered by the Company outside of the non-selective weedkiller category within the residential lawn and garden market. The application of the Roundup® brand to these additional products is subject to a product review and approval process developed between the Company and Monsanto. For additional details regarding the Restated Marketing Agreement, the Restated Brand Extension Agreement and the Commercialization and Technology Agreement, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — In the event the Restated Marketing Agreement for consumer Roundup® products terminates, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 6. MARKETING AGREEMENT” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We have classified our results of operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations during the applicable periods. See “NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution
We sell our products primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, food and drug stores, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors and retailers through both a direct sales force and our network of brokers and distributors. In addition, during fiscal 2017, we employed approximately 2,700 full-time and seasonal in-store associates within the United States to help our retail partners merchandise their lawn and garden departments directly to consumers of our products.
The majority of our shipments to customers are made via common carriers or through distributors in the United States. We primarily utilize third parties to manage the key distribution centers for our consumer business in North America, which are strategically located across the United States and Canada. Growing media products are generally shipped direct-to-store without passing through a distribution center. 
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials for our products from various sources. We are subject to market risk as a result of the fluctuating prices of raw materials such as urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply, minimize costs and improve predictability. We seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors. When appropriate, we commit to purchase a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the lawn and garden season to secure pre-determined prices. We also hedge certain commodities, particularly diesel, gasoline and urea, to improve cost predictability and control. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal 2017.
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We consider our trademarks, patents and licenses to be key competitive advantages. We pursue a vigorous trademark protection strategy consisting of registration, renewal and maintenance of key trademarks and proactive monitoring and enforcement activities to protect against infringement. The Scotts®, Miracle-Gro®, Ortho®, Tomcat®, Hyponex®, Earthgro®, General Hydroponics®, Vermicrop®, Gavita®, Botanicare®, Agrolux® and Can-Filters® brand names and logos, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Turf Builder®, EZ Seed®, Snap®, Organic Choice®, Nature’s Care®, Home Defense Max®, Nature Scapes®, Weed B Gon® and Roundup® for Lawns are registered in the United States and/or internationally and are considered material to our business. 
In addition, we actively develop and maintain an extensive portfolio of utility and design patents covering subject matters such as fertilizer, chemical and growing media compositions and processes; grass seed varieties; and mechanical dispensing devices such as applicators, spreaders and sprayers. Our utility patents provide protection generally extending to 20 years from the date of filing, and many of our patents will continue well into the next decade. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and supply arrangements, permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers, pesticides and mechanical devices. Although our portfolio of patents and patent licenses is important to our success, no single patent or group of related patents is considered significant to any of our business segments or the business as a whole.
Seasonality and Backlog
Our business is highly seasonal, with more than 75% of our annual net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our annual sales are further concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products, thereby reducing retailers’ pre-season inventories.
We anticipate significant orders for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season. Historically, substantially all orders have been received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year.
Significant Customers
We sell our products primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, food and drug stores, distributors, indoor gardening and hydroponic product distributors and retailers. Our three largest customers are Home Depot, Lowe’s and Walmart, which are reported within the U.S. Consumer segment and are the only customers that individually represent more than 10% of reported consolidated net sales. For additional 
6

details regarding significant customers, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, our top customers could adversely affect our financial results” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “NOTE 20. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competitive Marketplace
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product innovation, product quality, product performance, value, brand strength, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support, the strength of our relationships with major retailers, distributors and advertising. 
In the lawn and garden, pest control and indoor gardening and hydroponic markets, our products compete against private-label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Bayer AG, Central Garden & Pet Company, Enforcer Products, Inc., Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc., Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, FoxFarm Soil & Fertilizer Company, Nanolux Technology, Inc., Sun Gro Horticulture, Inc. and Advanced Nutrients, Ltd. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional competitors who operate in many of the areas where we compete.
In Canada, we face competition in the lawn and garden market from Premier Tech Ltd. and a variety of local companies including private label brands.
Research and Development
We continually invest in research and development, both in the laboratory and at the consumer level, to improve our products, manufacturing processes, packaging and delivery systems. Spending on research and development was $39.9 million, $36.0 million and $36.5 million in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, including product registration costs of $10.6 million, $10.6 million and $10.4 million, respectively. In addition to the benefits of our own research and development, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners.
Regulatory Considerations
Local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations affect the manufacture, sale, distribution and application of our products in several ways. For example, in the United States, all products containing pesticides must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947, as amended (“FIFRA”), and most require registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “U.S. EPA”) and similar state agencies before they can be sold or distributed. Fertilizer and growing media products are subject to state and foreign labeling regulations. In addition to the regulations already described, federal, state and foreign agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety. Our grass seed products are regulated by the Federal Seed Act and various state regulations. 
In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as “not for use on sod farms or golf courses”), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients.
State, federal and foreign authorities generally require growing media facilities to obtain permits (sometimes on an annual basis) in order to harvest peat and to discharge storm water run-off or water pumped from peat deposits. The permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested, with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas. We are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use. In some locations, these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water.
For more information regarding how compliance with local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations may affect us, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various environmental proceedings, the majority of which are for site remediation. At September 30, 2017, $4.8 million was accrued for such environmental matters. During fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we expensed $1.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for such environmental matters. We had no material capital expenditures during the last three fiscal years related to environmental or regulatory matters.
Employees
As of September 30, 2017, we employed approximately 4,700 employees. During peak sales and production periods, we employ approximately 5,900 employees, including seasonal and temporary labor.
