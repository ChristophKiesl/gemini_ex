General 
 Hub Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “Hub”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading supply chain solutions provider that offers comprehensive transportation and logistics management services focused on reliability, visibility and value for our customers. Our mission is to continuously elevate each customer’s business to drive long term success. Our vision is to build the industry’s premier supply chain solutions. Our service offerings include comprehensive intermodal, truck brokerage, dedicated trucking, managed transportation, freight consolidation, warehousing, last mile delivery, international transportation and other logistics services. 
 We are one of the largest freight transportation providers in North America, with the ability to arrange for the movement of freight in and out of every major city in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We utilize an asset-light strategy that employs a combination of our company-operated equipment as well as assets operated by third parties to transport and store our customers’ goods, which allows us to optimize our investment in equipment and facilities and reduce the level of capital we employ in our business. Hub services a large and diversified customer base in a broad range of industries, including retail, consumer products and durable goods.  We believe our strategy to offer multi-modal supply chain management solutions serves to strengthen and deepen our relationships with our customers and allows us to provide a more cost effective and higher service solution.
 Our service offering facilitates our customers’ desires for energy-efficient transportation solutions and assists in meeting their objectives to reduce their environmental footprint. Our intermodal service is significantly more fuel efficient as compared to long distance trucking transportation, and we continually seek opportunities to convert our customers’ trucking transportation needs to intermodal. In addition, our logistics offering includes shipment consolidation services which seeks to maximize the amount of freight carried per mile which reduces fuel consumption. We are continuing to replace older model tractors with more energy-efficient equipment and evaluating new technologies such as electrically-powered tractors. Our GPS-enabled container fleet allows for our truck drivers to efficiently locate our containers without driving wasted miles. We are an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay® Transport Partner, having been awarded the EPA’s SmartWay® Excellence Award eight times since 2008. Our headquarters building in Oak Brook, IL is a LEED Gold certified building.
 Our strategy includes the following elements:
  
• | Deepen and diversify our customer relationships through a best-in-class customer experience across all solutions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquire and organically develop new service offerings for our customers that will diversify our revenue streams and deliver sophisticated supply chain logistics solutions
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively invest in assets to drive organic growth and reduce our costs
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a world class information technology platform to drive growth and efficiency and support future innovations
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustain a culture that continues to enable innovation, service and teamwork
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We regularly evaluate acquisition and divesture transactions as a component of our strategy to enhance our core business lines and diversify our service offerings.  Our recent strategic transactions include the following:
 NonstopDelivery Acquisition. On December 9, 2020, we acquired NonstopDelivery, LLC (“NSD”). NSD provides residential last mile delivery services throughout the United States. The financial results of NSD, since the date of acquisition, are included in our logistics line of business.

CaseStack Acquisition. On December 3, 2018, a subsidiary of Hub Group, Inc. completed a merger with CaseStack, Inc. (the “CaseStack Acquisition”). CaseStack is a non-asset-based transportation and logistics provider operating in two lines of business. The logistics business provides warehouse and transportation logistics services, including retailer-driven collaborative consolidation programs, to customers who primarily consist of consumer goods companies selling into the North American retail channel. The transportation brokerage business offers truck brokerage services with a focus on less-than-truckload services.  
 Mode Sale. On August 31, 2018, we sold the membership interests of our Mode Transportation, LLC (“Mode”) subsidiary (the “Disposition”) to an affiliate of York Capital Management (“Purchaser”). Mode’s temperature protected division was not included in the transaction and is included in our intermodal line of business. Mode provided transportation management services to its customers through a network of approximately 170 agents.  
 Services Provided
Our lines of business can be categorized as follows: 
 Intermodal. As an intermodal provider, we arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in containers, typically over long distances of 750 miles or more. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment between rail terminals. Local pickup and delivery services between origin or destination and rail terminals (referred to as “drayage”) are provided by our Hub Group Trucking, Inc. (“HGT”) subsidiary and third-party local trucking companies.  
 In a typical intermodal transaction, the customer places an order with us and we determine the price and arrange for the necessary intermodal equipment (which includes a container and chassis) to be delivered to the customer by HGT or a third-party drayage company. After the freight is loaded, we arrange for the transportation of the container to the rail terminal where it is transported by the railroad to the destination rail terminal. Our predictive track and trace technology then monitors the shipment to ensure that it arrives as scheduled and alerts our customer service personnel if there are service delays. We then arrange for and confirm delivery by a drayage company at the destination. After unloading, the empty equipment is made available for reloading. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 41,500 53-foot containers that support our intermodal offering. 
 During 2020, HGT accounted for approximately 56% of Hub’s drayage needs by providing reliable, cost effective transportation services to our customers. As of December 31, 2020, HGT had terminals in the Atlanta, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Edinburg (TX), Harrisburg, Huntsville, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kalamazoo, Laredo, Memphis, Milwaukee, Nashville, Newark, Philadelphia, Portland (OR), Salt Lake City, San Bernardino, Seattle, St. Louis, Stockton and Wilmington (IL) metro areas. As of December 31, 2020, HGT leased or owned approximately 1,500 tractors and 200 trailers, employed approximately 1,400 drivers and contracted with approximately 900 owner-operators. 
 Logistics. Our logistics business offers a wide range of transportation management services and technology solutions including shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution and web-based shipment visibility. Our multi-modal transportation capabilities include small parcel, heavyweight, expedited, less-than-truckload, truckload, intermodal, last mile, railcar and international shipping. We leverage proprietary technology along with collaborative relationships with retailers and logistics providers to deliver cost savings and performance-enhancing supply chain services to consumer goods clients. We contract with third-party warehouse providers in seven markets across North America to which our customers ship their goods to be stored and eventually consolidated, along with goods from other customers, into full truckload shipments destined to major North American retailers. These services offer our customers shipment visibility, transportation cost savings, high service and compliance with retailers’ increasingly stringent supply chain requirements.
 In December 2020, we expanded our logistics services through the acquisition of NSD. NSD provides basic, threshold and white glove residential last mile delivery services including warehousing and distribution, product assembly and reverse logistics to many of the largest retailers in the United States. NSD operates a non-asset business model, working with a network of over 170 carriers through the country. NSD provides high levels of service to customers and end consumers through a centralized call center and dedicated account management teams. NSD’s logistics technology provides customers with real-time visibility to shipments, access to analytical tools and seamless integration with other platforms.
 Truck Brokerage. We operate one of the largest truck brokerage operations in the United States, providing customers with an over the road service option for their transportation needs. Our brokerage does not operate any trucks; instead we match customers’ needs with trucking carriers’ capacity to provide the most effective service and price combination. We have contracts with a substantial base of carriers allowing us to meet the varied needs of our customers.

In a typical truck brokerage transaction, the customer places an order with us for a particular freight movement. We make the delivery appointment and arrange with the appropriate carrier to pick up the freight. Once we receive confirmation that the freight has been picked up, we monitor the movement of the shipment until it reaches its destination and the delivery has been confirmed. 
 Dedicated. Our dedicated trucking operation contracts with customers who require high service transportation using equipment dedicated to their needs. We offer a dedicated fleet of equipment and drivers to each customer, as well as the management and infrastructure to operate according to the customer’s high service expectations. Contracts with customers generally include fixed and variable pricing arrangements and may include charges for early termination which serves to reduce the financial risk we bear with respect to the utilization of our equipment. Our dedicated operation currently operates a fleet of approximately 1,200 tractors and 4,600 trailers at 52 locations throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2020, dedicated employed approximately 1,300 drivers.
 Information Technology Systems
 Our technology strategy leverages strong technology at the core and emerging technologies at the edge to achieve our business goals and to keep pace with customer demands. We purchase commercially available technology for commodity capabilities, we extend to create additional value leveraging emerging technologies, and we build solutions where we can create differentiated experiences for our customers, drivers, carriers and employees. In 2018, we initiated our multi-year investment and process enhancement initiative that we refer to as “Elevate” which includes implementing core foundational technologies, Oracle enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), Oracle Human Capital Management (“HCM”) and Oracle Transportation Management (“OTM”) all of which are deployed in the cloud. Anchored on those common platforms, our technology strategy includes the deployment of differentiating solutions facing our customers and carriers through our Hub Connect application and for our drivers through our HubPro application. In addition, we continue to implement technology solutions focused on improving internal productivity and efficiency.
 The COVID-19 pandemic caused an abrupt shift in our 2020 initiatives and resulted in an urgent focus on the need to work from home.  Our previous investments in our security and infrastructure facilitated the seamless execution of this transition. Key elements of the technology stack that were critical included our significant investment in the Microsoft suite including O365, Teams, and Security solutions, among others. In addition, our data and voice solutions allowed our users to support our customers and our drivers seamlessly and securely from any location. Our industry leading digital solution, HubPro, was in the hands of all our drivers allowing us to continue to communicate effectively with our drivers keeping them productive while remaining safe. Our newest capability enhancement to our HubPro mobile app allows our drivers a completely contactless experience to facilitate the handoff of critical documents.
 A new product deployed during 2020 was Hub Connect: Carrier. This state-of-the-art technology solutions allows our carriers to seamlessly interact with us. This includes bidding on and booking freight, providing status updates, and streamlining the payment process.   
 Our Microsoft based Application Programming Interface platform has continued to mature and now facilitates numerous transaction types. Our customers and vendors value our ability to interact with them through multiple technology mediums allowing solutions to be deployed quickly.
 Finally, an area of focus in 2020 and continuing in 2021 is implementing automation solutions. This includes but is not limited to automating manual processes, using human augmentation solutions to allow our experienced supply chain professionals to make critical decisions while allowing our technology systems to complete commodity-orientated tasks and developing learning-based robots to drive better decision support for our operating teams.
 In 2021, we will continue to invest in new technology solutions that improve service, drive operating excellence, and reduce cost.  Our focus will remain on completing transitions to new technology allowing us to retire significant legacy applications and infrastructure currently in our eco system. In addition, as we continue with our acquisition strategy, we will enable seamless end to end visibility to all customers including those benefiting from multiple Hub solutions.

Relationships with Railroads 
 A key element of our business strategy is to strengthen our close working relationships with the major intermodal railroads in North America. Due to our size and relative importance, some railroads have dedicated support personnel to focus on our day-to-day service requirements. On a regular basis, our senior executives and each of the railroads meet to discuss major strategic issues concerning intermodal transportation. 
 We have relationships with each of the following major railroads: 
 
 
Canadian National | Kansas City Southern
-------------------+---------------------
Canadian Pacific | Norfolk Southern 
Ferromex | Union Pacific 
Florida East Coast | 

Relationships with Drayage Companies 
 Hub has a “Quality Drayage Program,” under which participants commit to provide high quality drayage service along with clean and safe equipment, maintain a defined on-time performance level and follow specified procedures designed to minimize freight loss and damage. We negotiate drayage rates for transportation between specific origin and destination points. 
 We also provide drayage services through our subsidiary HGT. Our drayage operations employ their own drivers and also contract with owner-operators who supply their own trucks. 
 Relationships with Trucking Companies 
 We contract with a large number of trucking companies that we use to transport freight. Our relationships with these trucking companies are important since these relationships determine pricing, load coverage and overall service. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
 We require all of our trucking company vendors to carry general liability insurance, truckman’s auto liability insurance and cargo insurance. Railroads, which are self-insured, provide limited cargo protection. To cover freight loss or damage when a carrier’s liability cannot be established or a carrier’s insurance is insufficient to cover the claim, we carry our own cargo insurance. We also carry general liability insurance with a companion umbrella policy on this general liability insurance.
We maintain separate insurance policies to cover potential exposure from our company-owned drayage and dedicated operations. We carry commercial general liability insurance subject to a policy aggregate limit, and trucker’s automobile liability insurance with a limit per occurrence. Additionally, we have an umbrella excess liability policy and maintain motor truck cargo liability insurance.
 Government Regulations 
 The Company and several of our subsidiaries are licensed by the Department of Transportation as brokers in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle. To the extent that we perform truck brokerage services, they do so under these licenses. The Department of Transportation prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including a $75,000 surety bond that we have posted. In addition, Hub has customs bonds. Our trucking subsidiaries operate under Department of Transportation motor carrier authority. To date, compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive positions; however, the transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. 
Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
 One of our operating subsidiaries achieved Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) certification in 2013 and have maintained it since then. C-TPAT is a voluntary supply chain security program led by United States Customs and Border Protection focused on improving the security of private companies’ supply chains. Companies who achieve C-TPAT certification must have a documented process for determining and alleviating risks throughout their international supply chain. This certification allows us to be considered low risk, resulting in expedited processing of our customers’ cargo, including fewer customs examinations.

Competition 
 The transportation services industry is highly competitive. We compete against intermodal providers, as well as logistics companies, third party brokers, trucking companies and railroads that market their own services. Several larger trucking companies have entered into agreements with railroads to market intermodal services nationwide. Competition is based primarily on freight rates, quality of service, reliability, transit time and scope of operations. Several transportation service companies and trucking companies, and all of the major railroads, may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. 
Human Capital
 Hub conducts business and provides services to customers through a combination of non-driver (e.g., corporate or terminal-based) employees, driver employees, and independent contractors. As of December 31, 2020, Hub Group had approximately 5,000 employees, which included approximately 3,000 drivers. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. 
 Hub’s success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled staff members and drivers. Our executive management team receives regular updates regarding office and driver headcount changes, turnover rates, hiring rates, and manager training and satisfaction. We invest in our driver and non-driver employees through our Hub University learning management system, which provides access to a variety of e-learning courses and modules to further develop job skills, increase knowledge of our business, and promote adherence to safety and compliance procedures. 
 Hub strives to create a culture of accountability, safety and teamwork. We set annual performance goals for our operations teams relative to collisions and injuries and track performance monthly and year-to-date to ensure accountability. Further, we provide company-wide recognition on a monthly basis for driver and non-driver employees who are nominated for performance that demonstrates our guiding principles of winning together, innovating with purpose and acting with integrity.
