ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
 
PureBase Corporation ("Purebase", the "Company", "we", or "our") was incorporated in Nevada on March 2, 2010. On January 12, 2015 the Company changed its name to PureBase Corporation and was assigned the new trading symbol "PUBC". The Company' executive offices are located at 8625 State Highway 124, Ione California 95640. The Company's telephone number is (209) 257-4331 and at the Company's Web address, www.Purebase.com.
 
The Company's Business
 
Purebase is a diversified, industrial mineral and natural resource company working to provide solutions to the agriculture and construction materials markets. The Company acquired most of its business and assets through a reorganization with Purebase, Inc. which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary called Purebase Agricultural, Inc. ("Purebase Ag"). Purebase Ag was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 11, 2013 as an exploration and mining company which will focus on identifying and developing advanced stage natural resource projects which show potential to achieve full production. Purebase' business is divided into two divisions, "Purebase Agricultural, Inc." to develop agricultural supplements and Purebase Build "SCM"  whose focus is to develop sector related products.  Purebase will provide for distribution of those products into each industry related market.
Agricultural Division
 
The Company's business plan will initially focus on the organic agricultural market sectors. The Company will seek to develop products derived from mineralized materials of Kaolin Clay, Laterite, Potassium Silicate Sulfate, Leonardite and other natural minerals. These important minerals are used in the agricultural industry to protect crops and fruits from the sun, winter damage, provide nutrients to plants, and better soil ecology with soil amendments to help farmers increase the yields of their harvests.
 
The Company will also seek to develop mineralized materials of pozzolan,  potassium and sulfate for agricultural applications. While some of the Company's current properties which it owns or controls contain pozzolan, potassium and sulfate, among other minerals, such mineralizations have yet to be quantified and do not represent "proven" or "probable" reserves as defined in Industry Guide 7 of the federal securities regulations.
 
Purebase will utilize its mining services contract with US Mine Corporation ("USMC"), a private company focusing on the development and contract mining of industrial mineral and metal projects throughout North America to perform exploration drilling, preparation of feasibility studies, mine modeling, on-site construction, mine production and mine site reclamation. Exploration services would also include securing necessary permits, environmental compliance and reclamation plans. In addition, a substantial portion of the minerals to be utilized by Purebase will be obtained from properties owned or controlled by USMC of which Scott Dockter, John Bremer and Craig Barto are officers, directors and owners.
 
We intend to develop innovative solutions that represent an important value-enhancing element for our agricultural customers. We intend to create a brand family under the parent trade name, "Purebase", consisting of four primary product lines: Purebase Shade Advantage WP, Purebase Potassium Silicate Sulfate Advantage , Purebase Humate Advantage,  and Purebase Soil Advantage.
 
Purebase Shade Advantage WP is a natural mineral plant protectant that reduces sunburn damage to plant tissue (including fruits and nuts) exposed to UV and infrared radiation.  The protection is achieved through the absorption of ultraviolet light and dissipation of heat, which reduces the stress on most plants.

The anticipated benefits of this product include:
  
● | Adheres to vascular tissue, fruit and wood electrostatically without the need for surfactants (stickers)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provides shade protection against sunburn of plant tissue and sun scalding of fruits, nuts and vegetables
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Purebase Shade Advantage's smaller particle size makes it more effective for protecting plants
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Designed for application on organic and conventional crops
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | When sprayed on dormant trees, Shade Advantage WP has the potential of increasing the chill hours
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Shade Advantage WP will be available in 25 lb. compostable and biodegradable bags.
 
Purebase Potassium Silicate Sulfate is derived from a proprietary potassium and sulfate mineral deposit. It provides many essential minerals, while lowering pH to allow nutrients to be available to plants, and improving soil biology. It can be applied to most crops, trees, vines and turf applications.  It will be available in granular grade and micronized solution grade, in bulk orders or 10, 20 and 50 lbs. bags.
 
Purebase Humate Advantage (Increased Nutrient Uptake) is derived from a proprietary deposit of leonardite. The combination of humic and fulvic acid in approximately a 3-to-1 ratio, coupled with a unique cross section of plant micronutrients, allow Purebase Humate Advantage(TM) to simultaneously improve soil quality as well as buffer high pH conditions. Products containing humic acids, may increase uptake of micronutrients.  It will be available in granular grade and available in micronized solution grade.
 
Purebase Soil Advantage provides valuable potassium that elemental sulfur products lack. A high plant available silicate is known to increase yields in crops such as corn, rice and sugar cane. It can stabilize soil and water pH to make some nutrients available to plants, provides Iron and Calcium to improve soil and plant quality, improves soil moisture holding capacity and aggregation, improves hydraulic conductivity by stabilizing osmotic pressure.  Purebase Soil Advantage, works to detoxify soils via heavy metal binding. It increases bioavailability of soil micronutrients, increases soil buffering capacity (CEC and AEC) and is a Nutrient source for microbes.  Purebase Soil Advantage mitigates water ponding and runoff by reducing soil compactness and increases soil flocculation. It will be available in granular grade, in bulk or 50 lbs. bags.
 
To date we have sent samples to potential customers and conducted trials with some sales of our proposed agricultural products to several prospective wholesale and retail customers including Helena Chemical, Crop Protection Services, Brandt, Fertizona LLC, G Farms, Massey Ag, AG Trading Inc.(Peru), Clements Nut Company, Biglieri Farms, Pressley Farms, Bananera Favre, Kelchem Ltd. (Australia), North Valley Ag. Distributors, and Bee Sweet Citrus. The Company currently has Distributor Agreements with Clements Nut Co. (US) and distributors in Vietnam (including Cambodia and Laos) and Peru. Purebase is also an approved vendor for Helena Chemicals.
 
Production and distribution of the Company's agricultural products will be dependent on the Company's ability to extract adequate essential minerals from its existing projects or acquire such minerals from other existing sources. The Company currently obtains its Humate minerals from an existing third party mine.
 
In April, 2016 the Company entered into a joint venture in order to develop proprietary technologies for use in the agricultural markets, primarily to assist farmers in managing their crops. In furtherance of this joint venture, in May, 2016 a Delaware corporation called Purebase Networks, Inc. ("PNI") was formed by Mr. Ridder in order to develop these farming technologies. The Board of Directors consisted of John Wharton, Steve Ridder and Scott Dockter with Mr. Wharton and Mr. Ridder serving as the executive officers. On May 31, 2016 PNI approved the joint venture with PureBase and commenced business operations. At November 30, 2016 the Company maintained a 82% ownership interest in PNI. In order to fund PNI's technology development, it raised investor funds of $750,000. At November 30, 2016, $500,000 of these funds are recorded as a "subscription liability" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets until PNI has sufficient authorized shares to issue to its investors. In November, 2016, the Company became dissatisfied with the management and progress of PNI's business and on November 16, 2016 the PNI Board relieved Mr. Ridder of his officer duties. Subsequent to this action, PNI obtained a Temporary Restraining Order against Mr. Ridder to prevent him from taking any

further action relating to PNI's business or corporate funds. Subsequent to the fiscal year-end, PNI commenced negotiating  Settlement Agreements with Mr. Wharton and Mr. Ridder to resolve the parties' differences. On March 27, 2017 Mr. Ridder entered into a Settlement Agreementin in which he agreed to cancel his options to purchase 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock and mutual releases by the Company and Mr. Ridder from any further liability to each other. In addition, his Settlement Agreement provided for Mr. Ridder to retain 75% ownership of PNI, Mr. Wharton to retain 15% ownership of PNI and the Company to retain 10% ownership of PNI and for Mr. Scott Dockter and Mr. Wharton to resign from the PNI Board leaving Mr. Ridder as the sole officer and Director of PNI.
 
Construction Division
 
It is estimated that one ton of CO2 is released for every ton of portland cement manufactured.  The negative external byproducts of portland cement production is predominantly carbon dioxide. The impact on the environment from the production of portland cement presents a global concern. As such, increasing environmental regulations will continue to add to the direct costs of concrete building materials composed of portland cement. Pozzolan blended cements have lower CO2 emissions than traditional portland cement. The result is stronger, more durable concrete, better price, and reduced pollution. California is leading the way with legislation such as the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which requires cement producers to lower emissions or purchase carbon credits for overages of CO2 to 1990 levels by 2020. The responsible response to this problem is the development of supplemental cementitious materials, or SCMs. Natural occurring pozzolan is the most environmentally neutral SCM available. This presents Purebase with a unique and valuable opportunity as a "clean and green" solution provider of natural pozzolan as a replacement for traditional cement used in all types of construction.
 
 Within the Construction Division, operating as Purebase Build, the Company plans to develop and market a Supplementary Cementitious Material ("SCM"), a solution that may be used in large infrastructure development projects for government, commercial industries and residential buildings.
 
Research has demonstrated that mix designs with as much as a 50% replacement of portland cement used can be a very desirable product offering reduce pollution residuals. The beneficial effects of Pozzolan in terms of compressive strength, performance and durability are mostly attributed to the pozzolanic reaction in which calcium hydroxide is consumed to produce additional C-S-H and C-A-H reaction products. These pozzolanic reaction products fill in pores and result in a refining of the pore size distribution or pore structure. This results in a lowered permeability of the paste and increased overall strength.
 
The Company believes the benefits of Purebase Pozzolans to the Cement Industry and Type 1P Pozzolan Cement include:
  
● | Pozzolan may replace portland cement at a rate between 15% and 50%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pozzolan may be raw or calcined.
--+---------------------------------


● | Pozzolan is environmentally friendly.
--+--------------------------------------


● | Pozzolan requires less electricity in the production process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pozzolan reduces greenhouse emissions.
--+---------------------------------------


● | Pozzolan increases concrete durability.
--+----------------------------------------



Pozzolan cement can be used in most applications including concrete paving, reinforced walls, floors, sidewalks, well-cementing, precast-pre-stressed concrete, concrete pipe, block and paver production.
 
We plan to produce a pozzolan SCM at very competitive rates. Cartage will play a major factor in pricing, but we anticipate there will still be a substantial cost margin between fly ash used in Portland cement and Pozzolan.
 

7
 


Production of the Company's SCM will depend on the Company's ability to extract adequate amounts of the raw Pozzolan from its existing mining projects.
 
 Purebase is also developing its Distributor Program to strategically co-market and present our mutual products and services to local governments, industry and end consumers. Our Distributor Program will enjoy the benefits of local product labeling, co-marketing materials and reciprocal sales opportunities. The bottom line is a dynamic, fluid partnership that increases business.
 
In the future, the Company may wish to enter additional product markets which derive from natural resources such as glass, silica chips and solar panels.
 
Purebase will utilize its mining services contract with US Mine Corporation to identify, acquire, define, develop and operate world-class industrial and natural resource properties and to provide mine development and operations services to mining properties located initially in the Western United States and currently in California and Nevada. Purebase intends to engage in the identification, acquisition, development, mining and full-scale exploitation of natural mineral properties in Ione California as its primary focus.


The Company was unable to secure funding during the last fiscal year to fund its proposed development budget but hopes to be able to fund further development during FY 2017.
 
The Company will initially rely on outside funding for its development expenses. The need for external financing will be offset by revenues, as and when generated.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has five full-time employees.  Employees include a CEO, a CFO and a Vice President of Agricultural Products Research and Development. We anticipate hiring additional employees during the current year to work the Company's agricultural production operations as our agricultural products development and distributions programs continue to expand. While skilled equipment and operations personnel are in demand, we believe we will be able to hire the necessary workers to sustain our current product development and production programs. Our employees are not expected to be subject to a labor contract or collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
 
Outside services, relating primarily to agricultural market research  and product development, and relating to the development and application of SCMs, as well as other technical matters as may be deemed useful in the product development and branding activities, will be provided by independent contractors.
 
Industry Overview
 Agricultural Industry
 
Agriculture and agriculture-related industries contributed $775.8 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014, a 4.8% of GDP. The output of America's farms contributed $166.9 billion of this sum—about 1% of GDP. In 2014, 16.5 million full- and part-time jobs were related to agriculture – about 9.2% of total U.S. employment. Direct on-farm employment provided over 2.6 million of these jobs. (Source: The US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, Agricultural Resource Management Survey Farm Financial and Crop Production survey).
 
U.S. land area amounts to nearly 2.3 billion acres, with nearly 1.2 billion acres in agricultural lands. Virtually all farms today utilize various fertilizers to better utilize water resources and increase crop yields. In the US, corn crops use approximately 45% of the total available fertilizer. This is more than the combined 29% that wheat, soybeans, oilseeds, fruit and vegetables use. The remaining 26% is used by other crops. California leads the country as the largest Ag producer .In terms of sales value, California leads the country as the largest producer of agricultural products (crops and livestock), accounting for almost 11% of the national total, based on the 2012 Census of Agriculture. Iowa, Texas, Nebraska, and Minnesota round-out the top five agricultural producing States, with those five representing more than a third of U.S. agricultural-output value.

Crops account for the largest share of the value of U.S. agricultural production. The value of agricultural production in the United States has risen over the past decade due to increases in production as well as higher prices. Yield gains for crops have been particularly important, although acreage has also risen recently in response to elevated prices since 2008. Falling prices led to a slight decline in value of crop production in 2013. While livestock production increased over the decade, prices were up more than 60% between 2003 and 2013, contributing to the rising value of livestock production and its agricultural consumption.
 
Climate change including increase in drought trends and an increasing population base are exacerbating the problem of adequate food production. Pesticides, GMO crops and irrigation with reclaimed water are some of the current solutions, but this is proving to be toxic to the environment, plant, animal and human health. Purebase intends to promote environmental conservation through the manufacture, sale, and distribution of the highest quality industrial minerals and natural resources in the marketplace. Our plan is to create a high-quality alternative to current GMO limited use soil amendments in the world's markets by offering a high quality water conservation product.
 
Construction Industry
 
Concrete is a common building material consisting of water, sand, gravel (i.e. aggregate), and cement. The Economist in June 2013 estimated world cement-makers' annual revenue at $250 billion. Portland Cement is the most prevalent cementing material in the world. According to the Portland Cement Association (PCA), Long-Term Cement Consumption Outlook, the United States' cement consumption is expected to reach nearly 192 million metric tons in 2035, up from current levels of an estimated 86 million metric tons in 2014.
 
Driven by healthy gains in the economy and most construction segments, cement use was expected to grow 7.5% in 2016, according to the latest PCA forecast. The USA is the world's 3rd largest producer of Cement. The increase will bring U.S. cement volume to approximately 103.2 million tons in 2016. Of the 50 US states, the top 3 cement producers in descending order by volume are Texas, California and Missouri. Long-term demand considerations must be weighed against supply conditions.
 
Competition
 
Major competitors in the Soil Amendments Industry include:
  
● | Tiger-sul: Tiger-sul is a manufacturer of bentonite sulphur and bentonite micronutrients technology. They manufacture products for the Agricultural, Organic & Turf markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Heart of Nature: Heart of Nature provides natural "ph reducing" sulfur products to farmers that help their crops to uptake water and nutrients more efficiently. Heart of Nature is located adjacent to the USMC mine site. This company is currently producing in the range of 1,500 tons per month.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Major competitors in the Cement Additive Industry include:
 
 
● | Boral: Boral Limited is Australia's largest building and construction materials supplier and has significant operations in the USA and in Asia. With approximately $5 billion worth of sales, Boral has over 15,900 employees working across 717 operating sites. The US operations include the country's largest brick manufacturer, the largest clay tile manufacturer, one of the largest fly ash suppliers, and the group holds a strong position in the Denver construction materials market and more recently in Oklahoma construction materials. Boral Materials Technologies has approximately 40 locations around the country including operations at electrical utility plants, fly ash terminals and sales offices marketing approximately 4 million tons of fly ash annually. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Salt River Materials Group: SRM, which is the marketing arm of Phoenix Cement is a leading supplier of portland and masonry cements, fly ash and other Pozzolan SCMs, both normal and light weight aggregates, and natural gypsum products throughout Arizona and the Southwestern United States. SRM manages approximately 500,000 tons of fly ash annually.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pricing Competition
 
The cement additive sector relies heavily on the construction industry.  Increased construction activity ultimately decreases the amount of available competitive products, particularly fly ash.  Reduced availability of competitive products results in increased costs making our natural pozzolan alternative more attractive to prospective customers.
 
The Top 3 buying criteria for SCMs are:
 
1.       Product quality
 2.       Price with product proximity (i.e. cartage / delivery) as a principle factor in price
 3.       Service and support
 
Many of our competitors have greater exploration, production, and capital resources than we do, and may be able to compete more effectively in any of these areas. For example, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisition of desirable mineral properties, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance the exploration and development of their mineral properties. Our inability to secure capital to fund exploration and, if warranted, development costs for our mineral properties would create a competitive cost disadvantage in the marketplace which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and potential profitability.
 
We also compete in the hiring and retention of key executives, skilled laborers, experienced subcontractors and other employees and contract personnel. Consequently, though unlikely, it is possible that we may not be able to hire or retain qualified geologists, exploration personnel or equipment operators in the numbers or at the times desired.
 
Government Controls and Regulations
 
Natural resource exploration, mining and processing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, development, production, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, control of toxic substances, and other matters involving environmental protection and employment.  United States environmental protection laws address the maintenance of air and water quality standards, the preservation of threatened and endangered species of wildlife and vegetation, the preservation of certain archaeological sites, reclamation, and limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other things.  There can be no assurance that all the required permits and governmental approvals necessary for any mining project with which we may be associated can be obtained on a timely basis, or maintained in good standing.  Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain necessary government permits and approvals may adversely impact our operations. The regulatory environment in which we operate could change in ways that would substantially increase costs to achieve compliance.  In addition, significant changes in regulation could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to timely and effectively implement our drilling/mapping programs and develop our mining properties.
 
Outlined below are some of the more significant aspects of governmental controls and regulations which materially affect the mining properties we or our third party mineral suppliers will seek to explore and develop.
 

10
 



Federal Regulation of Mining Activity
 
Mining operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations.  At the federal level, mining properties are subject to inspection and regulation by the Division of Mine Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor ("MSHA") under provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The Occupation and Safety Health Administration ("OSHA") also has jurisdiction over certain safety and health standards not covered by MSHA.  Mining operations and all proposed exploration and development will require a variety of permits.  In addition, any mining operations occurring on federal property are subject to regulation and inspection by the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM"). While we have considerable experience in the mining permitting process, permitting procedures are complex, costly, time consuming and subject to potential regulatory delay.  We currently own mining rights in several properties having existing permits in place or properties where existing permitting requirements and other applicable environmental protection laws and regulations would not pose a material hindrance to our ability to explore and develop such properties. As part of our initial evaluation of suitable projects, we will ascertain a property's regulatory compliance status and any issues affecting current or future permitting requirements.  However, we cannot be certain that future changes in laws and regulations would not result in significant additional expenses, capital expenditures, restrictions or delays associated with the exploration and development of our current or future projects.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain new permits or whether material changes in permit conditions will be imposed.  Obtaining new mining permits or the imposition of additional conditions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop the mining properties in which we have an interest or ownership or could increase the costs charged by third party suppliers or decrease the amount of minerals available from third party suppliers.
 
Legislation has been introduced in prior sessions of the U.S. Congress to make significant revisions to the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872 that would affect our potential development of unpatented mining claims on federal lands, including any royalty on mineral production. It cannot be predicted whether any of these proposals will become law.  Any levy of the type proposed would only apply to unpatented federal lands and accordingly could adversely affect the profitability of any future mineral production from projects being explored by the Company on federal property.
 
All of our current mining projects will be governed by the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (1976) established the BLM's multiple-use mandate to manage the public lands "in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archeological values; that, where appropriate, will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition". The Lands, Minerals & Water Rights branch coordinates with BLM planning and resource specialists to manage surface resources, minerals and water rights to ensure that authorized uses of public lands do nothing to diminish their health and productivity or impair their use and enjoyment by present and future generations.
 In connection with exploring, mining, and milling activities, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species.
 With respect to the permits required for our projects mentioned above, we may be unable to obtain such permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we, or our third party suppliers, cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving such permits, our timetable and business plan for development and mining of these properties or those of third party suppliers could be adversely affected. See Item1A. "Risk Factors" for more information.

Mining Environmental Regulations
 
Mining activities, including drilling, mapping and development and production activities are subject to environmental laws, policies and regulations. These laws, policies and regulations affect, among other matters, emissions to the air, discharges to water, management of waste, management of hazardous substances, protection of natural resources, protection of endangered species, protection of antiquities and reclamation of mined land. Legislation and implementation of regulations adopted or proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the BLM and by comparable agencies in various states, directly and indirectly affect the mining industry in the United States. These laws and regulations address the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing, including potential contamination of soil and water from tailings, discharges and other wastes generated by the mining process.  In particular, legislation such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and the National Environmental Policy Act require analysis and/or impose effluent standards, new source performance standards, air quality standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of mining and mineral processing, including natural resource mining and processing of the type to be conducted by the Company.  Such statutes also may impose liability on mine developers for remediation of waste they have created.
 
Mining projects also are subject to regulations under (i) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") which regulates and establishes liability for the release of hazardous substances and (ii) the Endangered Species Act ("ESA") which identifies endangered species of plants and animals and regulates activities to protect these species and their habitats.  Revisions to "CERCLA" and "ESA" are being considered by Congress; however, the impact of these potential revisions on our business is not clear at this time.
 
The Clean Air Act, as amended, mandates the establishment of a Federal air permitting program, identifies a list of hazardous air pollutants, including various metals and pollutants, and establishes new enforcement authority.  The EPA has published final regulations establishing the minimum elements of state operating permit programs.  We will be required to comply with these EPA standards to the extent adopted by the State in which development projects are located.
 
In addition, developing mining sites requires mitigation of long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and revegetating various portions of a site. While a portion of the required work can be performed concurrently with developing the property, completion of the environmental mitigation occurs once removal of all materials and facilities has been completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans which have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.  The mining developer must insure that all necessary cash deposits and provision to cover the estimated costs of such reclamation as required by permit are made.
 
Any exploration and development of mining projects by the Company will be conducted in substantial compliance with federal and state regulations and be consistent with the need to remediate any environmental impact.
 
Agricultural Products Certifications
 
All sales of agricultural products have to be registered in order to be sold, distributed and or applied in farming operations. Standards for registration are set by and regulated by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) at the federal level.  All state agencies must also comply with federal guidelines. There are guidelines for the registration of the products for agriculture use, some of which are federal, others are State. Because our product(s) are organic, they must meet several qualifications in order to become registered.
 

12
 


In California, for example, the task of regulating the registration processes is carried out by the CDFA (California Department of Food and Agriculture). There are some activities within the regulatory process that are executed by recognized and licensed private entities such as chemical laboratories and certifying laboratories. In some instances, per various international treaties, some of bilateral and some by regional structures (European Union, etc) some governmental and private organizations are recognized and licensed to play particular roles in certifying and/or in the certifying processes.
 
Currently Purebase has one product fully registered as an organic plant protectant: Purebase Shade Advantage WP. The WP stands for Wettable Powder which means the powder goes into suspension when mixed with water. We have registration certificates for this product in the states of California and Washington. Purebase is currently pursuing US registration of its other agricultural products.
