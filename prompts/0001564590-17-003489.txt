Seasonality and Show Rotation
 GES U.S. and GES International exhibition and event activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the frequency and timing of shows, as some shows are not held each year and some may shift between quarters. During 2016, GES U.S. reported its highest revenue during the second and third quarters. During 2015, GES U.S. reported its highest revenue during the first and second quarters. GES International generally reports its highest revenue during the second and fourth quarters. The show rotation revenue metric refers to the net change in revenue from 2015 to 2016 due to show movement between quarters and years. Show rotation refers to shows that occur less frequently than annually, as well as annual shows that shift quarters from one year to the next. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors – Viad’s businesses are seasonal, which causes results of operations to fluctuate and makes results of operations particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods” and “Item 1A – Risk Factors - Show rotation impacts overall profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult,” which are incorporated herein by reference.
Competition
 GES U.S. and GES International generally compete across all classes of services and all markets in the Live Events industry on the basis of discernible differences, value, quality, price, convenience, and service. GES has a competitive advantage through its worldwide network of resources, experienced personnel, pioneering service programs and offerings, first class execution, proprietary technology platforms, and financial strength. All known U.S. competitors and most international competitors are privately held companies that provide limited public information regarding their operations. The primary competitor for GES within its Core Services is The Freeman Company (a privately held, U.S. headquartered company); however, there is substantial competition from a large number of service providers in the other categories of service offerings. 
Growth Strategy
 GES is committed to becoming the preferred global, full-service provider for Live Events. GES holds a dominate market position in Exhibitions and is pursuing a focused and disciplined growth strategy of expanding its market share in the currently under-penetrated Conferences, Corporate Events, and Consumer Events. GES has uniquely combined the art of high-impact creativity, service, and expertise with the science of easy-to-use technology, strategy, and worldwide logistics to help clients gain a greater return from their events and enhance the exhibitor experience.

The Company owns patents that it believes provide competitive advantages in the marketplace for its exhibit and exhibition services. Its patented technology relating to a modular structure having a load-bearing surface provides efficiencies and cost savings in the design, manufacture, assembly, take down, and maintenance of displays and exhibitions. Its patented invention relating to a surface-covering installation tool and method not only reduces direct labor costs, but provides improved worker safety. The Company also owns a number of design patents for its retail merchandising units. United States utility patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date a patent application is filed and United States design patents are currently granted for a term of 14 years from the date granted. GES has extensive design libraries with copyright protections and owns copyright registrations for a number of the designs within its design libraries. Copyright protection for such work is 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.
 Although Viad believes that certain of its patents, trademarks, and copyrights have substantial value, it does not believe that the loss of any one of those patents, trademarks, or copyrights would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, or the financial condition or results of operations of any of its reporting segments.
 Government Regulation and Compliance 
 Compliance with legal requirements and government regulations represents a normal cost of doing business. The principal regulations affecting the day-to-day businesses are rules and regulations relating to transportation (such as regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and its state counterparts), employees (such as regulations implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, equal employment opportunity laws, guidelines implemented pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and general federal and state employment laws), unionized labor (such as guidelines imposed by the National Labor Relations Act), and U.S. and Canadian regulations relating to national parks (such as regulations established by Parks Canada, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the U.S. National Park Service).
 Some of Viad’s current and former businesses are subject to U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts. Compliance with federal, state and local environmental, health and safety provisions, including, but not limited to, those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and other actions relating to the environment, have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on Viad’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors - Liabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect results of operations” and Note 20 – Litigation, Claims, Contingencies, and Other of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a discussion of the risks related to liabilities arising from the Company’s compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws, which are incorporated herein by reference.
