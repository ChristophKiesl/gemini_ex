Item 1. Business
 
As used herein, the term “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refers to Rogue One, Inc., a Nevada corporation and subsidiaries unless otherwise noted.
 
Overview
 
We are an insolvent corporation. We have a history of having no sales revenues, negative cash flow and no profits and we cannot assure that we will ever be successful in generating and sustaining any sales revenues, positive cash flow or profits at any time in the future. We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware under the name, PLR, Inc. in 1993. Later we completed several name changes and reorganizations.
 
In November 1997, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Integrated Carbonics Corp. We also changed our domicile to the State of Nevada. On July 23, 1999, we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Urbana.ca, Inc. (“URBA”).
 
And on April 11, 2003, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to PSPP Holdings, Inc. and later on August 11, 2008 we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Cynosure Holdings, Inc.
 
On August 21, 2008, we again amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Mod Hospitality, Inc. This was followed by a further amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on December 16, 2009 wherein we changed our name to Stakool, Inc.
 
On June 16, 2011, we entered into a Letter of Intent of Sale and Purchase with Anthus Life Corp., a privately held Nevada corporation (“Anthus”). Subsequently and on July 20, 2011, we and Anthus executed an Agreement of Sale and Purchase whereby Anthus stockholders received 77,588,470 shares of 79,388,470 shares of our then issued and outstanding common stock together with 10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock in exchange for scheduled payments, totaling $350,000 and 1,300,000 shares of our common stock (the “Anthus Acquisition Agreement”).
 
Subsequently, the Stakool and Anthus Acquisition Agreement was amended effective January 19, 2012 to allow for the issuance of an additional 2,650,000 shares of our common stock to certain parties to acquire all of the then outstanding common stock of Anthus. As a result of the Anthus Acquisition Agreement, Anthus became our wholly-owned subsidiary and all of the shares of our preferred stock and common stock were duly issued and the sum of $355,000 was duly paid in accordance with that agreement.
 
Anthus was incorporated in Nevada on June 4, 2009. At the time of the closing of the Anthus Acquisition Agreement, Anthus was a developer and manufacturer of certain natural and organic food products packaged for consumer consumption. At the time, Anthus had one product line in the natural food category and others that it believed could be viable commercial products.
 
However, and in 2013 following our internal financial evaluations, we terminated the production of the Anthus products in light of our assessment of our limited ability to raise the additional capital needed to market and sell the Anthus products.
 
On March 15, 2013 all of our officers and directors resigned and Mr. Joseph C. Canouse was appointed as our President, Chief Executive Officer, and sole Director
 
While we believe that our Anthus product line may offer good value to consumers, we have not undertaken any product or market research to confirm our assessment. Even if the Anthus product line has strong commercial value, unless or until we have sufficient additional financial and managerial resources needed to undertake the anticipated additional market research and the manufacturing, marketing, and promotional efforts that would be required to implement any re-commercialization of the Anthus products, we may not pursue any re-commercialization of the Anthus product line. In the event that we are successful in obtaining sufficient additional capital, we may, if market conditions are favorable, resume production of one or more of the Anthus products. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain the additional capital that will allow us to undertake these efforts or if we do obtain any additional capital, that it can be obtained on reasonable terms and in sufficient amounts on a timely basis that will allow us to implement any such efforts at any time in the future.

Current Products, Potential Product Categories and Product Extensions
 
We envision the Company as a consumer products company focused on the alcoholic beverage sector. We also view the Company as a brand acquisition and holding company. Subject to the constraints and challenges that we face as summarized in our Risk Factors (and elsewhere in this Annual Report), we may be able to offer products that we believe may provide products that capitalize on the growing alcohol beverage market and changing consumer habits in the industry. Human Brands diversified operating divisions currently own and manage over 250,000 agave plants, several premium spirit brands such as Armero Tequila, three hospitality concepts (Santo Coyote, Santa Cantina, and Museo by Santo), and holds exclusive import/export rights for a variety of spirit brands (Capacity Beverage).
 
We believe that we may be different than many of our competitors in that if we are able to secure the necessary financial and managerial resources on a timely basis and in sufficient amounts, we may be able to combine innovative technology and product development with perceptive marketing and sales service strategy.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have no patented technology and we do not hold any patents that would otherwise serve to provide us with any protection of our intellectual property rights.
Production, Sources of Raw Materials and the Names of Principal Suppliers
 
Our officers and our consultants have reviewed, studied and analyzed the alcoholic beverage product market in certain product areas, our strategy is to establish a product procurement and development program that may allow us to obtain the assistance of marketing professionals. In all of these efforts we may, if our financial circumstances and market conditions allow, offer us an opportunity to build our business, create brands through eco-friendly packaging and distinctive labeling, and develop potentially key product distribution relationships in selected geographic and certain markets that may offer us significant opportunities.
Marketing Strategy
 
If we can successfully implement our business strategy, we seek to have our brand name strongly associated on with high quality products that attract a strong consumer interest and to focus our efforts on finding and developing complimentary products for North American consumer market and beyond.
 
Human Brands International, Inc. (“Human Brands”) is a diversified holding company in the spirit and hospitality sectors with a primary focus on the tequila industry. The Company was established in late 2014 to capitalize on the growing alcohol beverage market and changing consumer habits in the industry. The Company currently has several wholly-owned subsidiaries that focus on five key areas of business: (i) agave, (ii) bulk tequila production, (iii) brand development, (iv) import/export, and (v) hospitality. Please visit the website at www.humanbrandsinc.com for more information.
 
Overall and if we are able to obtain sufficient additional financial resources on a timely basis and if market conditions allow, we seek to become a leader in certain segments of the alcoholic beverage business and, in so doing, set the standards of excellence for other manufacturers as well. We are aware that our products will need to meet very high consumer expectations and provide greater consumer value in an intensely competitive marketplace where other larger and well-established manufacturers have far greater financial, managerial, and marketing resources than we have and which we may have in the future. We do not anticipate that competition in the alcoholic beverage marketplace will decrease at any time in the future. And to the extent that we are able to implement our strategy and our product and marketing plans, there can be no guarantee that we will gain and later sustain any significant share of the market and do so while also generating profits and positive cash flow. There are many large national and international alcoholic beverage companies that have nearly unlimited financial resources, marketing budgets, research staff, and other resources that are far beyond any that which we currently have and any that we likely will have in the future.
 
Our limited in-house product research has led us to believe that there may be a sufficiently large consumer segment that may be attracted to our products, product value, and product taste that may allow us to gain sufficient product distribution and a retail presence in certain geographic markets.
 
The vertically integrated structure of Human Brands enables the Company to drive business from each level of the supply chain, from ground to glass. The Company's goal is to bring consumers, and shareholders, an authentic 'experience' through each of its products, brands and locations, while continuing to grow its revenues and build its asset values.

Competition
 
We face many large and highly successful and well-established competitors who have a long history of success in marketing a large and diverse product line in the alcoholic beverage industry. These competitors compete in multiple geographic and product markets with the help of internal and external market research that we will never likely possess at any time in the future. They are well-established, multi-million-dollar companies that possess a greater and far more sophisticated understanding of consumer trends and they have significant consumer research capabilities that far exceeds our current capabilities and those that we likely will have in the future. Each of these competitors also possess sophisticated marketing models, a deep reservoir of experienced distributors and greater market research capabilities than we will likely ever have. These advantages are augmented with far greater managerial and financial resources that are far beyond and likely will be far beyond anything that we will ever possess. As a result, any person who acquires our Common Stock, our Preferred Stock, or any other security that we may issue should be prepared to lose their entire investment.
Employees
 
At the present time, the Company has three employees.
