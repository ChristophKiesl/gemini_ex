Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company that has developed a platform and pipeline focused on creating an entirely new class of cellular medicines called Red Cell Therapeutics, or RCTs, for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.
As previously announced, on February 20, 2023, following the conclusion of our review of strategic alternatives, our Board of Directors unanimously approved the dissolution and liquidation of Rubius, or the Dissolution, pursuant to a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution, or the Plan of Dissolution, which plan is subject to stockholder approval. As such, the following discussion and analysis of our business, financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and should also take into account our recent announcement regarding our planned Dissolution. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans, operations, intellectual property and other matters related to our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with our planned Dissolution. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
On November 2, 2022, we announced that, in light of our financial condition and the early stage of our programs, our Board of Directors approved a plan to review strategic alternatives, including a sale or merger of the Company or one or more sales of our assets, and to significantly and immediately reduce our operations, which we refer to as our strategic plan. In connection with the strategic plan, we terminated 42 of our employees (representing 82% of our then-current employee base), leaving a core team of individuals to lead the strategic review process. 
On September 13, 2022, our Board of Directors approved certain operational and organizational steps that we undertook in connection with a new strategic reorganization plan and related cost-saving measures. We discontinued our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of RTX-240 and RTX-224 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and restructured the organization to support advancing drug candidates based on our next generation platform. Under this plan, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 75%, primarily consisting of employees who were focused on clinical development of RTX-240 and RTX-224, with the remainder coming from our manufacturing and general and administrative functions. 
Although we ceased enrolling patients in 2022, with more than 80 patients dosed across three clinical trials, we demonstrated that engineered red blood cells, or RBCs, can be manufactured at scale and observed initial evidence of tolerability clinical activity in certain cancer patients, including evidence of tumor shrinkage and prolonged stable disease in PD-(L)-1 refractory solid tumors. Based on these early findings, we firmly believe in the potential of RCTs for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.
September 2022 Restructuring
Following careful review of technical progress made during 2022 in an alternative format for making RCTs, we determined that this alternative process had the potential for substantive improvements over our first generation RED PLATFORM, and, therefore, continued investment in our two clinical candidates was no longer justified. As a result, in September 2022, we announced that we would be discontinuing our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of RTX-240 and RTX-224 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and implemented a new strategic reorganization plan focused on advancing drug candidates based on this next generation RBC-based cell conjugation platform and related cost-saving measures. 
The next generation platform leverages chemical conjugation to produce RCTs. Cell conjugation creates a covalent link between the cell surface and the molecule of interest. Compared to our first generation RED PLATFORM, this new approach is intended to:
Table of Contents

•deliver a higher effective dose by enabling a longer circulation time and/or administering a higher cell dose;
•be more versatile, enabling the conjugation of different payloads, immunomodulatory agents, small molecules and proteins on the cell for enhanced potency; and
•reduce the cost of goods manufacturing by utilizing blood-banked RBCs versus biologically engineering and differentiating early progenitor cells into reticulocytes that express proteins.
These attributes have the potential to result in greater efficacy, a similar safety profile given the restricted biodistribution of RBCs to the spleen and vasculature, and a significant reduction in overall cost structure. 
To enable continued investment in the new platform, the cost-saving measures implemented in September 2022 included:
•implementing an approximately 75% reduction in workforce, primarily focused on clinical development, manufacturing and general and administrative personnel;
•discontinuing our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of RTX-240 and RTX-224 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors; and
•exploring the sale of our manufacturing facility in Smithfield, Rhode Island.
With these cost-saving measures, our operations were significantly reduced and were focused on maintaining the new platform and related preclinical programs for purposes of exploring strategic alternatives.
Overview of Discontinued Clinical Programs
Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Monotherapy RTX-240
36 patients were dosed in the monotherapy arm of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of RTX-240 in advanced solid tumors. To date, RTX-240 has been well tolerated with no treatment-related Grade 3/4 adverse events, or AEs.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of RTX-240 + Pembrolizumab in Advanced Solid Tumors
Sixteen patients were dosed in the dose-escalation/expansion portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating RTX-240 in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors. To date, the combination of RTX-240 with pembrolizumab has been well tolerated with no treatment or investigator-identified immune-related Grade 3/4 AEs.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of RTX-224 in Select Advanced Solid Tumors
Seven patients were dosed across two dose cohorts in the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating RTX-224 in select advanced solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, cutaneous melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial (bladder) carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. To date, there have been no treatment-related Grade 3/4 AEs.
Termination of Credit Facility
On October 13, 2022, we entered into a payoff letter with SLR Investment Corp. (f/k/a Solar Capital Ltd.), or SLR, our senior lender, under which we voluntarily prepaid SLR approximately $75.7 million, in full satisfaction of all obligations, including all outstanding principal, accrued interest, fees, costs, expenses and other amounts chargeable, under our Loan and Security Agreement, dated December 21, 2018, with SLR (as amended, the “Loan Agreement”) and related security documents. The payoff letter also provided for the termination of all commitments and obligations under the Loan Agreement and related documents and release of all liens held by SLR on our assets.
November 2022 Restructuring
On November 2, 2022, we announced that, in light of our financial condition, including the repayment and termination of our $75.0 million credit facility with SLR, and the early stage of our programs, our Board of Directors approved a plan to review strategic alternatives, including a sale or merger of the Company or one or more sales of our assets, and to

significantly and immediately reduce our operations, which we refer to as our strategic plan. In connection with the strategic plan, we terminated 82% of our employee base as of November 2, 2022, leaving a core team of individuals to lead the strategic review process.
Sale of Manufacturing Facility
On December 6, 2022, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with DIV Acquisition V, LLC for the sale of our Smithfield, Rhode Island manufacturing facility and certain related fixtures and personal property, for an aggregate purchase price of $18,500,000, subject to adjustment. The transaction closed on December 21, 2022.
Termination of Lease Agreement
On December 12, 2022, or the Effective Date, we entered into an Agreement for Termination of Lease, or the Lease Termination Agreement, with ARE-MA Region No. 58, LLC, or ARE, relating to our corporate headquarters located at 399 Binney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, or the Cambridge Facility. Under the Lease Termination Agreement, our Lease Agreement, dated as of January 18, 2018, with ARE (as amended, the “Lease”) for the Cambridge Facility terminated on January 31, 2023.
Under the terms of the Lease Termination Agreement, we paid to ARE a lease termination payment of approximately $6,973,308, consisting of (i) ARE’s right to draw the full amount of a letter of credit that it held under the Lease, in the amount of $1,573,308, (ii) an initial payment of $4,300,000, inclusive of rent previously paid by us to ARE for the month of December 2022 in the amount of $910,060, and (iii) a subsequent payment of $1,100,000. We also conveyed ownership to ARE of certain items of personal property, furniture, fixtures and equipment located within the Cambridge Facility. Pursuant to the Lease Termination Agreement, we have no further rent obligations to ARE pursuant to the Lease following the Effective Date.
IND Withdrawals
In connection with the strategic plan, we withdrew our Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, for RTX-134 and RTX-321 on December 9, 2022. We withdrew our INDs for RTX-224 and RTX-240 on December 13, 2022 and December 14, 2022, respectively.
Approval of Plan of Dissolution 
On February 20, 2023, following the conclusion of our review of strategic alternatives, our Board of Directors unanimously approved the Dissolution, pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution, which plan is subject to stockholder approval. We intend to call a special meeting of the stockholders to seek approval of the Plan of Dissolution. We plan to file a preliminary proxy statement relating to the special meeting with the SEC, and to subsequently file and provide stockholders with a definitive proxy statement, as soon as practicable.
The Company cautions that trading in the Company’s securities is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Trading prices for the Company’s securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual value realized, if any, by holders of the Company’s securities. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in its securities.
Intellectual property
We have a broad portfolio of patent applications, know how, trade secrets, and other intellectual property that covers our platform technologies as well as our product discoveries. We believe the breadth and depth of our intellectual property is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide a significant competitive advantage over other cell therapy companies. 
We have striven to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements in our intellectual property portfolio, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from collaborators or other third parties. Our policy has been to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product discoveries. We have also historically relied on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product discoveries and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of engineered red blood cell therapeutics. 
Table of Contents

We believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our proprietary product discoveries, technology and platform, including related manufacturing processes and technology. As for our product discoveries, platform, and the processes we have developed, we have pursued, as appropriate, patent protection or trade secret protection relating to compositions, methods of use, treatment of indications, dosing, formulations and methods of manufacturing. Our former product candidates – RTX-240, RTX-321 and RTX-224 – are covered by three varieties of U.S. patent claims: (1) composition of matter; (2) method of treatment; and (3) method of making. As of January 31, 2023, our patent portfolio consists of 30 patent families (not including provisional applications and including licensed patent families), including 20 issued U.S. patents (including in-licensed U.S. patents), 30 patents issued outside the United States (including in-licensed patents outside of the United States), 22 owned or in-licensed pending U.S. utility patent applications, and more than 130 owned or in-licensed pending patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications) that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. Examples of the products and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below.
Disease-related intellectual property
The disease-related patent rights in our intellectual property portfolio relate to pathological conditions and disorders and provide coverage for our former RCT product candidates to specifically address those conditions and the associated disease states. The disease-related patent applications include those described below. Each of the disease-related patent rights and applications described below are owned by us and are not licensed from any third party:
RTX-240 and RTX-224 for certain oncology indications
We developed RTX-240, our former RCT product candidate engineered to express 4-1BBL and IL-15TP (a fusion of the cytokine IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha), for the treatment of patients suffering from hematological or solid cancers that have lost response to conventional therapies, including anti-PD-1 therapies or other immune-oncology therapies, and to prevent the emergence of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and other immune-oncology therapies. RTX-240 was designed to induce the proliferation and activation of two key target cells, the NK cell and CD8+ memory T cell. 
We developed RTX-224, our former RCT product candidate engineered to co-express 4-1BBL and IL-12, for the treatment of patients suffering from solid tumors where a T cell mechanism of action is critical. The introduction of membrane-bound IL-12 is thought to have very broad T cell-based activation, including all subsets of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, while sparing the induction of the CD4+ regulatory T cells.
•This aspect of our patent portfolio relates to RCTs that express 4-1BBL, RCTs that express IL-15 or IL-15TP, RCTs that express IL-12, RCTs that co-express 4-1BBL and IL-15TP, RCTs that co-express 4-1BBL and IL-12, methods of activating CD8+ T cells and NK cells, methods of treating cancer, methods of making RCTs that express 4-1BBL and IL-15TP, including RTX-240, and methods of making RCTs that express 4-1BBL and IL-12, including RTX-224.
•As of January 31, 2023, the patent rights relating to this technology includes five issued U.S. patents, two pending U.S. utility patent applications, and 18 pending foreign patent applications derived from National Stage entries, relating to RCT compositions of matter, methods of activating immune cells, methods of treatment, and methods of making RTX-240 and RTX-224. We expect the issued patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2037 and 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
RTX-321, an artificial antigen presenting cell for the treatment of HPV-positive tumors
We developed our former product candidate RTX-321, an artificial antigen presenting cell RCT, to express an HPV 16 peptide antigen bound to MHC class I, 4-1BBL and IL-12 on the cell surface to mimic human T cell-APC interactions. RTX-321 was formerly in development for the treatment of HPV 16-positive tumors.
•This aspect of our patent portfolio relates to RCTs that express 4-1BBL, RCTs that express IL-12, RCTs that co-express 4-1BBL and IL-12, RCTs that express an HPV 16 peptide antigen bound to MHC class I, 4-1BBL, and IL-12, methods of treating cancer, and methods of making RCTs that express an HPV 16 peptide antigen bound to MHC class I, 4-1BBL and/or IL-12, including RTX-321.
•As of January 31, 2023, the patent rights relating to this technology includes four issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, and 32 pending foreign patent applications derived from National Stage entries,

relating to RCT compositions of matter, methods of treatment and methods of making RTX-321. We expect the issued patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2037 and 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Additional oncology intellectual property
We own disease-related patent applications directed to RCTs for use in oncology, including immuno-oncology. These patent applications relate to RCT compositions that comprise a variety of agents, including anti-tumor antibodies, tumor starvation enzymes, pro-apoptotic proteins, costimulatory molecules, immune checkpoint inhibitors, tumor antigens, MHC molecules and numerous combinations thereof. These patent applications also cover the use of RCTs to treat cancer, including lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia, as well as various relapsed or refractory cancers.
We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2040, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Autoimmune disease intellectual property
We own disease-related patent applications directed to RCTs for use in treating autoimmune diseases. These patent applications relate to RCT compositions having autoimmune antigens, anti-cytokine antibodies, agents for cleaving autoimmune antibodies and numerous combinations thereof. The RCTs covered by these patent applications operate through various mechanisms, including through induction of tolerance to self-antigens, clearance of autoimmune antibodies from the bloodstream, clearance of cytokines from the bloodstream and inactivation of autoimmune antibodies. The patent applications also cover the use of these RCTs to treat a number of diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes, membranous nephropathy, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease and neuromyelitis optica.
We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2040, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Cardio-metabolic disorders intellectual property
We own disease-related patent applications directed to RCT compositions and their use in treating cardiac disorders and metabolic disorders, including diabetes, obesity heart failure, atherosclerosis and hemophilia. We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire in 2037, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Infectious disease intellectual property
We own disease-related patent applications directed to RCT compositions and their use in treating infectious diseases, such as a viral infection (e.g., cytomegalovirus or HIV) or a bacterial infection (e.g., bacteremia). We expect the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2040 without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions we may obtain.
Platform-related intellectual property
In addition to the disease-related intellectual property, our intellectual property portfolio also includes know-how and patent applications directed to our first and second generation RED PLATFORM and other technologies developed internally and exclusively in-licensed from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, or WIBR, that relate to the engineering and culturing of RCTs. Exemplary platform technologies that are the subject of such patent applications include:
•methods related to the in vitro production of enucleated red blood cells;
•gene editing and transcriptional modulation systems for engineering RCTs;
•targeted lipid nanoparticle compositions and RNA delivery techniques;
•amplifiable nucleic acid constructs for optimizing protein production;
Table of Contents

•methods for chemically conjugating biotherapeutic proteins to cell surfaces; and
•methods for increasing percent enucleation during RCT production.
Individual patent terms extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Trademark protection
As of January 31, 2023, our trademark portfolio contains approximately 59 registrations and pending applications. For the RUBIUS THERAPEUTICS mark, we have issued registrations in the U.S., Argentina, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, and an International Registration designating Australia, China, the E.U., India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, and Switzerland.

Finally, we have a U.S. registration for the RTX mark.
Trade secrets
We have historically relied, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and aspects of our platform. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We have sought to protect our technology and product discoveries, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors. We have also sought to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by third parties. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors have used intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk factors—Risks related to intellectual property.”
Licenses
In January 2016, we entered into an exclusive license with WIBR that grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under patent rights comprising two patent families to research, develop, make and commercialize products and processes covered by such patent rights for all uses, or the WIBR License. The WIBR License was amended in December 2017 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a third patent family jointly owned by WIBR and Tufts University, or Tufts. The WIBR License was amended in July 2018 to grant us an exclusive license to the commercialization rights under a fourth patent family owned by WIBR. As of January 31, 2023, the patent portfolio licensed from WIBR includes five issued U.S. patents, and 19 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and issued foreign patents. We expect these WIBR-licensed patent applications, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2038, without taking into account any patent term adjustments or extensions that may be obtained. 
Table of Contents

The patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License are directed, in part, to the in vitro production of RBCs and the use of the enzyme sortase to conjugate a protein of interest to the cell surface. We have certain diligence obligations under the WIBR License, which include using commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize any products under the patents and achieving certain milestones as further described in the WIBR License. Additionally, under certain circumstances, we may in the future be obligated to negotiate in good faith field-limited, non-exclusive sublicenses to allow third parties to exploit the patent rights licensed to us under the WIBR License.
WIBR retains the right with respect to all four patent families licensed to us to (i) practice the patent rights licensed under the agreement for research, teaching and educational purposes, including sponsored research and collaboration, and (ii) grant non-exclusive licenses to academic and not-for-profit research institutes to practice under the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes (excluding sponsored research), while Tufts retains such rights only with respect to the patent family that it co-owns. Pursuant to a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency agreement between WIBR and a global biopharmaceutical company, the biopharmaceutical company funded research resulting in one of the licensed patent families and WIBR granted the biopharmaceutical company the right to retain a worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to use this patent family for research and development purposes. In addition, under the WIBR agreement, the U.S. federal government retains a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to practice any government-funded invention claimed in the patent rights, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §§ 201-211 and Executive Order 12591.
As partial consideration for the license, we issued 366,667 shares of our common stock to WIBR. In addition, we paid WIBR an upfront payment and are required to pay annual license maintenance fees, creditable against royalties and milestone payments. Under the terms of the license, we are obligated to pay to WIBR low single-digit royalties based on any annual net sales by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees of licensed products and licensed services that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights at the time and in the country of sale. On a country-by-country basis, upon expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product or licensed service in such country, our license becomes royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable with respect to such country. The terms of the WIBR License require us to make aggregate milestone payments of up to $1.6 million upon the achievement of specified preclinical, clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are required to pay to WIBR a percentage of the non-royalty payments that we receive from sublicensees of the patent rights licensed to us by WIBR. This percentage varies from low single digits to low double digits and will be based upon the clinical stage of the product at the time of the sublicense.
Under the WIBR License, WIBR controls the prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights licensed to us and we have the right to review and comment on such prosecution and maintenance. We have the first right to enforce the patent rights licensed to us against third party infringers. We may terminate the WIBR License for convenience upon three months prior written notice to WIBR. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License upon written notice to us if we, along with our affiliates and sublicensees, cease to carry on business related to the WIBR License for more than six months. WIBR may terminate the WIBR License for our material breach that remains uncured for sixty days after receiving notice thereof, if we fail to pay amounts due under the agreement within thirty days after receiving notice of such failure, or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patent rights.
