Zurich and CCIA

On April 17, 2013, the Company executed a Surety Forbearance and Confession of Judgment Agreement (the “Forbearance Agreement”) with Zurich, which superseded the Financing Agreement. Subsequently, the Company defaulted on the Forbearance Agreement.


On February 20, 2015, the Company entered into a Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Zurich which provided for the payment to Zurich by the Company of $650,000 (the “Settlement Amount”) to settle the Company’s outstanding balance of approximately $1,850,000 then in default, and which was previously due in full on December 31, 2013, under the existing Forbearance Agreement with Zurich. Upon execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Company paid Zurich $200,000, with the remaining balance of $450,000 payable in 10 equal monthly installments of $45,000. As of April 30, 2016, the Settlement Amount was paid in full.

Business Strategy
 
Industry Background
 
We focus primarily on markets such as: public service, healthcare, energy and education markets, which continue to show excellent growth potential.


Public Services
 
We provide communications infrastructure for public services, which includes utilities, education, military and transportation infrastructure. We believe there is an active market for communications infrastructure in the public service sector due to the need to create cost efficiencies through the implementation of new communications technology.
Healthcare
 
We provide communications infrastructure for hospitals and medical centers. In the healthcare market, the aging population is resulting in demands for upgraded and additional hospital infrastructure. New construction and renovations are occurring for hospitals domestically and internationally. In addition, there is a need to reduce the cost of delivering healthcare by implementing new communications technology. Our services include electrical power, structured cabling, security systems, life safety systems, environmental controls and communication systems.

7
-

Energy
 
We provide communications infrastructure for petrochemical, natural gas and electric utility companies. The need to deliver basic energy more efficiently is driving the growth in energy construction. This creates opportunities to upgrade and deploy new communications technology.
Education
 
We provide communication infrastructure for the education market. Many schools are upgrading technology backbone and wireless communications.
 
Strategy
 
We currently offer our low voltage communications, security and audio-visual infrastructure contracting services to the public services, healthcare, energy, education and corporate enterprise markets. These services are offered through our Suisun Operations. We provide an integrated approach to project coordination that creates cost-effective solutions. Corporations, government entities, healthcare organizations and educational institutions depend on the reliability and accuracy of voice, data and video communications. However, the potential for this new technology cannot be realized without the right infrastructure to support the convergence of technology. In this regard, we create integrated building systems, including the installation of advanced structured cabling systems. We specialize in wireless technology or combination of various technologies to develop a cost effective network for a customer's wireless communication requirements. This includes Wi-Fi networks, point-to-point systems, cellular networks, in-building systems and two-way communication systems. We support the integration of telecommunications, life safety, security and HVAC in an environmentally safe manner and design for future growth by building in additional capacity for expansion as new capabilities are added.
 
In September 2015, we sold our 60% majority ownership interest in our China Operations in an all-cash transaction, for $1,500,000. The decision to sell our China operations was part a continuing effort to generate cash through the sale of non-core assets and/or to eliminate unprofitable operations (having previously closed the Trenton Operations and selling other operations ). Meanwhile, we continue to evaluate a number of opportunities to, not only increase the profits and cash flow at our Suisun City Operations, but to find viable acquisition or merger candidates.
 
Project Characteristics
 
Our contracts are primarily service-based projects providing installation and engineering services, which include providing labor, materials and equipment for a complete installation. The projects are staffed with a project manager who manages multiple projects and a field supervisor who is responsible for an individual project. A project may also include subcontracted services along with our direct labor. The project manager coordinates the daily activities of direct labor and subcontractors and works closely with our field supervisors. Project managers are responsible for job costing, change order tracking, billing, and customer relations. Executive management monitors the performance of all projects regularly through work-in-progress reporting or percentage-of-completion, and reviews this information with each project manager. Our projects are primarily executed on a contract basis. These contracts can be awarded through a competitive bidding process, an informal bidding process, or a simple quote request. Upon award of a contract, there can be delays of several months before work begins. The active work time on our projects can range in duration from a few days up to as long as two years.

Sales and Marketing
 
We have dedicated sales and marketing resources that develop opportunities within our existing customer base, and identify new customers through our strategic market focus and our relationships with technology providers. When an opportunity is identified, we assess the opportunity to determine our level of interest in participation. After qualifying an opportunity, our sales and marketing resources work with the estimating teams to prepare a cost estimate and contract proposal for a particular project. We keep track of bids submitted and bids that are awarded. Once a bid is awarded to us, it is assigned to a project management team and included in our backlog. In addition to its bidding work, the Company has recently hired a sales team to identify and secure direct business opportunities.
Competition
 
We face competition from numerous service organizations, ranging from small independent regional firms to larger firms servicing national markets. Historically, there have been relatively few significant barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate, and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and product line may become a competitor. The principal competitive advantage in these markets is establishing a reputation of delivering projects on time and within budget. Other factors of importance include accountability, certifications, project management expertise, industry experience and financial strength. We believe that the ability to provide comprehensive turnkey low voltage communications infrastructure, security, video and audio-visual package gives us a competitive advantage. In addition, we offer union workforce that allow us to bid on major union projects in San Francisco and the entire Bay Area, creating yet another competitive advantage.
Customers

We serve a variety of public services, healthcare, energy, education and corporate enterprise customers. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, there were two (2) major customers who provided 23.8% of our revenue.
Employees
 
We currently employ 77 employees, 17 of which are employed on a full-time basis (6 in administration and 11 in Operations), and 60 of which are unionized. We hire union employees on an “as needed basis” and the number of union employees will vary depending on the number of jobs in process.
