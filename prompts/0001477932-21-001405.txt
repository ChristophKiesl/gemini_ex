RECENT TRANSACTIONS
 
On October 26, 2020 the Company established an advisory committee. The advisory committee consists of seven members with expertise in the global warming communities. Each member has agreed to serve on the advisory committee for 2 years. The goal of the advisory committee is to make recommendations to the company and its scientist in matters within the areas of their experience and expertise, based upon the members’ reasonable research, study, and analysis. Compensation for serving on the advisory committee has is determined by the board of directors on an individual by individual basis based upon the experience, knowledge and negotiated value. The advisory committee will meet three times per year.
 
On November 17, 2020 the Company’s CEO cancelled 12 million shares he owned in the Company. The CEO received no compensation for such cancellation.
 
On December 3, 2020 the Company incorporated Alterna Motors, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Subsequently, Alterna Motors entered into a letter of intent with Classic Electro, LLC, based in Grodno, Belorussia. It is in the intent of the parties for Alterna Motors to be the American and Canadian distributor of Classic Electro’s retrofitting engine concept and universal electric mobility installation kit. The Company has no assurances at this time that this project will be implemented, that an actual agreement will be entered into, or if this project will be successful. In addition, Alterna Motors is developing a line of three-wheeled, all electric local delivery vehicles for use in the USA and Europe. The Company has no assurances at this time that this project will be implemented, that an actual agreement will be entered into, or if this project will be successful.

On December 5, 2020 the Company converted all its outstanding debt into common stock. Total debt converted was $531,203 at the conversion price of $2.13 per share. An additional two million shares were issued to three debt holders as settlement for converting at $2.13 per share instead of $0.01 as outlined in their various debt instruments. Under the conversions, Paul Rosenberg was issued 1,155,585 shares of common stock, Epic Industry Corp was issued 550,606 shares of common stock and Overwatch Partners, Inc., was issued 523,899 shares of common stock.
 
On December 11, 2020 the Company announced it was relocating its headquarters to Temecula, California in January 2021. At this time the Company has not yet relocated its headquarters.
 
In December 2020, we began developing and designing an ECO APP for calculating, assessing, monitoring CO2 emissions and reforestation of affected areas. The application will use satellite imaging and other remote-sensing technologies to measure real time atmospheric CO2 being absorbed and stored by trees and other plants across the USA and Europe. The Company is still evaluating revenue potential opportunities associated with this initiative. The Company has no projections when this project will be complete, when or if the project will be offered on the market, or if the project will be successful. 
 
In 2020, the Company entered into the initial phase of testing its theory for a sodium-based battery. The study is in conjunction with a Scientific School in Kazakhstan. The study’s focus is of electrochemical processes in biological objects. The Company believes that the transfer rate of sodium ions in our solid electrolyte is sufficient to provide power to the vehicle. The Company has divided the project into three phases. The end result will be the testing of a sodium-based battery on a light chassis. The Company has no projections when this project will be complete, when or if the project will be offered on the market, or if the project will be successful. 
 
In 2021 the Company has engaged MSP Corporate, a Ukrainian patent agency to file a patent on behalf of the Company for their mobile system for the production of hydrogen and electric energy during the movement of automobiles. We believe our system is more suitable for vehicular applications as it recovers metal sodium produced by means of circulating electrical current. The Company has no projections when this project will be complete, when or if the project will be offered on the market, or if the project will be successful.
 
GENERAL OVERVIEW
 
The Company is engaged in the business of retail sales in global warming products and solutions and CBD products. We believe that our products will provide our business consumers with solutions to mitigate risks associated with global warming. Our CBD products sold direct to customers is an ancillary service based upon the patterns and habits of our target market. In addition to the resale component of our business, we provide consulting services in various approaches to the mitigating global warming risks and assist our clients with an execution plan for the benefit and growth of their business. 
 
We compete in a highly competitive market that includes other global warming companies, as well as other CBD companies. Our growth is reliant upon our ability to promote our business as earth stewards and attract the attention of the target market who view environmental awareness as a lifestyle.
 
Thus far, we have been successful in driving traffic to our websites and building a client base. Specifically, we have built a presence on leading social-media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Through these sites, we post information about our services and make daily attempts to engage our target audience. This process is designed to drive traffic to our websites and eventually leads to sales. The marketing strategy is cost-effective, and we do not anticipate any significant costs arising from this strategy.
 
We currently operate the following websites, which are not incorporated as part of this registration statement:

IMPLICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY
 
We currently qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These reduced reporting requirements include:

§ | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
§ | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this prospectus and in our future periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
§ | not being required to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or to seek stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.



We may continue to take advantage of these reduced reporting obligations until such time as we no longer meet the eligibility requirements. If certain events occur prior to such date, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non--convertible debt in any three- year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company.
 
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and other matters in this prospectus and other filings we make with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders is different than the information you might receive from other public fully reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
 
The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we are not subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
 
Industry Overview
 
Global Warming Industry
 
Typically, executives manage environmental risk as a threefold problem of i) regulatory compliance, ii) potential liability for industrial accidents, and iii) pollutant release mitigation. But climate change presents business risks that are different in kind because the impact is global, the problem is long-term, and the harm is essentially irreversible. 
 
The market for global warming solutions is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, resulting in a dynamic competitive environment with several dominant national and multi-national leaders. The Company will have to compete with established corporations that have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and human resource capabilities. Such competition may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive distribution policies and make more attractive offers to potential clients. The Company expects competition to persist and intensify in the future.
 
Management believes that there is an increasing demand for money-making ideas created by the warming of our planet and that products and services that slow the flow of greenhouse gases by using less energy or by substituting clean energy for fossil fuels are in great demand. 
 
Cannabidiol (CBD) Industry
 
Since 1992, when the Endocannabinoid System (ECS) was discovered, many different studies have been conducted on the role it plays in our health and disease management. Since we all possess an ECS, it makes logical sense that we would all benefit in some way with the inclusion of CBD and other cannabinoids in our daily lives.
 
This research coupled with the spreading legalization of recreational and medical cannabis is why CBD has become mainstream. The increasing worldwide access to CBD products is dispelling many of the myths around it. People who are new to cannabis are recognizing its benefits. The continued growth of the cannabis industry will rely on educating people who are unfamiliar or wary about the plant.
 
Additionally, the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp farming, removing this plant rich in CBD from the Controlled Substance Act and restoring it to its traditional place as an agricultural commodity. This bill will allow states to regulate hemp farming and move forward the industrialization of the hemp plant. As this scale up hemp-based CBD products will become ever more common. The hemp-CBD market is projected to grow from just under $600 million in 2018 to $22 billion by 2022.
 
Hemp Industry
 
There are an estimated 25,000 products derived from hemp, that fall into nine submarkets: agriculture, textiles, recycling, automotive, furniture, food and beverages, paper, construction materials, and personal care.
 
The estimated total retail value of hemp products sold in the U.S. in 2016 was $688 million, a 20% increase from the previous year. There is an average of 15% annual growth in U.S. retail sales from 2010-2105. China is the largest importer of raw and processed hemp fiber in the U.S. Canada is the predominant importer of hemp seed and oil cake.
 
Description of Business
 
Our current business strategy is to generate revenue through three basic options: i) consulting fees, ii) royalty fees, and iii) retail sales. 
 
Principal Products
 
We sale products through our website(s). We maintain no inventory. All sales are based upon resale agreements we have with manufacturers. We are reliant upon our suppliers to have the product available for direct shipment to our customers. Our payment terms for resale items are typically upon the placement of the order. 
 
The resale operations currently are not seasonal. As we begin to bring global warming products, such as HCU fertilizer, seasonal sales will become more abundant. 
 
We have no government contracts at this time, nor are we seeking any. Our retail operations are primarily business to customer, while our consulting and royalty revenues, when earned, will be primarily, business to business.
 
Warranties
 
Warranties for products are manufacturer warranties. We offer no other terms.

Customers
 
Approximately 93% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated from one client in the country of Hungary. This Company represented approximately 92% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets, and Other Intellectual Property
 
In order to generate revenue from royalties and consulting, we have been developing technologies for future use and development. There are no assurances any of these items currently identified as research and development will materialize or generate revenue for the Company.
 
We have created various formulas and processes we intend to patent and/or copyright for future use and licensing. The following list comprise our intellectual property:
 
Pick-Up-Oil – is a proprietary carbon sorbent for oil collection. Under the process, the airborne sorbent is discharged in the oil slick and after absorbing the oil is collected. The product is then extracted from the oil and available for secondary use. 
 
Vita Technologies – consists of i) Carbonit – humate based products that is believed to help healthier plants with half the required fertilizer; ii) Humate Coated Urea (HCU), a fertilizer that is currently under a Pilot Program in New Zealand; iii) Sustainable Food Safety and Shelf Life Technology; iv) PureRay HLE Grow Light, a proprietary wavelength combination of light that is believed to reduce spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms; and v) Water Purification System.
Growth Strategy
 
We anticipate growth in our operations through normal acceptance of our products, through the licensing of our technologies and intellectual properties, and through acquisitions when deemed in the best interest of our shareholders.
Competition
 
The Company competes with other industry participants, including those in global warming and CBD products and services. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Company’s control may make it more attractive for prospective customers to transact business with other entities.
 
Our potential competitors may have greater resources, longer histories, more developed intellectual property, and lower costs of operations. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.

Employees
 
We currently have 2 officers and directors who provide all the primary research and development for future licensing and product evaluations. Our management team currently has no agreement with the Company and works on an as needed basis. We assume as the requirements grow, future commitments from our officers will be obtained. Current management is believed to have been compensated at below market levels during the past five years. 
 
All other services required by the Company are managed through consultants on an as needed basis.
