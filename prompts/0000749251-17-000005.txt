MARKET OVERVIEW

Technological innovations are changing how businesses and other organizations plan and operate and at an increasingly rapid pace. Today, everyone is living and working in the midst of a technological revolution in which technology is seen as increasingly driving organizational strategies rather than just supporting them. The nexus of four powerful forces – social, mobile, cloud and information, coupled with the "Internet of things" – are blurring the line between the physical and digital worlds, creating unprecedented change on a scale not seen before facing every organization around the world, from business enterprises and units within enterprises of every size, to governments and government agencies, as well as other organizations. The rate and pace of technology innovation and change is rapid. Trends such as digital, cloud, the "Internet of things," and cyber-security threats are creating unprecedented change for every organization around the world, from business enterprises and units within business enterprises of every size, across every vertical industry (including governments, public sector, and not-for-profit), and in every major geography. We believe this technology revolution will remain vibrant for decades to come.

Information technology is critical to supporting increased productivity, service and performance improvement, revenue growth, and protecting the enterprise from cyber-security threats. As the costs of IT solutions continue to rise, executives and professionals have realized the importance of making well-informed decisions and increasingly seek to maximize their returns on IT capital investments. As a result, every IT investment decision in an enterprise is subject to increased financial scrutiny, especially in the current challenging economic climate. In addition, today’s IT marketplace is dynamic and complex. Technology providers continually introduce new products with a wide variety of standards and features that are prone to shorter life cycles. Users of technology – a group that encompasses nearly all organizations – must keep abreast of new developments in technology to ensure that their IT systems are reliable, efficient, secure, and meet both their current and future needs. Given the strategic and critical nature of technology decision-making and spending, business enterprises, governments and their agencies, and other organizations turn to Gartner for guidance in order to make the right decisions to maximize the value of their IT investments.

OUR SOLUTION

We provide our clients with the insight they need to understand where – and how – to successfully harness technology to achieve their mission critical priorities. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our intellectual capital. The foundation of our business model is our ability to create and distribute our proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings, consulting and advisory services, and our events, including the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo series.

We had 1,294 analysts as of December 31, 2016 located around the world who create compelling, relevant, independent and objective research and fact-based analysis on every major IT initiative and all aspects of the IT industry, including supply chain and digital marketing initiatives. Through our robust product portfolio, our global research team provides thought leadership and technology insights that CIOs, supply chain professionals, marketing professionals, executives and other technology practitioners need to make the right decisions, every day. In addition to our analysts, as of December 31, 2016 we had 628 experienced consultants who combine our objective, independent research with a practical business perspective focused on the IT industry. Finally, our events are the largest of their kind, gathering together highly qualified audiences that include CIOs and other IT executives, frontline IT architects and professionals, supply chain leaders, marketing leaders, and purchasers and providers of technology and supply chain products and services.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and sources of value for our clients that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting services and events. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume and penetration with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and advice. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, augment our sales capacity, and expand into new markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services.

Our principal products and services are delivered through our Research, Consulting and Events businesses:


• | RESEARCH. Gartner delivers independent, objective technology, supply chain and marketing research and insight primarily through a subscription-based, digital media service. Gartner research is the fundamental building block for all Gartner services and covers all technology-related markets, topics and industries, as well as supply chain and digital marketing initiatives. We combine our proprietary research methodologies with extensive industry and academic relationships to create Gartner solutions that address each role within the IT, supply chain, and marketing organization. Our research agenda is defined by clients’ needs, focusing on the critical issues, opportunities and challenges they face every day. Our research analysts are in regular contact with both technology providers and technology users, enabling them to identify the most pertinent topics in the IT marketplace and develop relevant product enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users of our research. They provide in-depth analysis on all aspects of technology, including hardware; software and systems; services; IT management; market data and forecasts; and vertical-industry issues. Our proprietary research content, presented in the form of reports, briefings, updates and related tools, is delivered directly to the client’s desktop via our website and/or product-specific portals. Clients normally sign subscription contracts that provide access to our research content for individual users over a defined period of time. We typically have a minimum contract period of 12 months for our research subscription contracts and currently almost half of our contracts are multi-year.


• | CONSULTING. Gartner Consulting deepens relationships with our largest Research clients by extending the reach of our research through custom consulting engagements. Gartner Consulting brings together our unique research insight, benchmarking data, problem-solving methodologies and hands-on experience to improve the return on a client’s IT investment. Our consultants provide fact-based consulting services to help clients use and manage IT to optimize business performance.

Consulting solutions capitalize on Gartner assets that are invaluable to IT decision making, including: (1) our extensive research, which ensures that our consulting analyses and advice are based on a deep understanding of the IT environment and the business of IT; (2) our market independence, which keeps our consultants focused on our clients' success; and (3) our market-leading benchmarking capabilities, which provide relevant comparisons and best practices to assess and improve performance. Gartner Consulting provides solutions to CIOs and other IT executives, and to those professionals responsible for IT applications, enterprise architecture, go-to-market strategies, infrastructure and operations, program and portfolio management, and sourcing and vendor relationships. Consulting also provides targeted consulting services to professionals in specific industries. Finally, we provide actionable solutions for IT cost optimization, technology modernization and IT sourcing optimization initiatives.

• | EVENTS. Gartner Symposium/ITxpo events and Gartner Summit events are gatherings of technology’s most senior IT professionals, business strategists and practitioners. Our events offer current, relevant and actionable technology sessions led by Gartner analysts. These sessions are augmented with technology showcases, peer exchanges, analyst one-on-one meetings, workshops and keynotes by technology’s top leaders. They also provide attendees with an opportunity to interact with business executives from the world’s leading technology companies.

Gartner Summit events focus on specific topics or roles, providing IT professionals with the insight, solutions, and peer networking opportunities to succeed in their job role. Our Catalyst conferences are the premier events for front-line IT technical professionals and architects. Our Supply Chain and Digital Marketing conferences are the premier gatherings for senior supply chain and marketing leaders. 
COMPETITION

We believe that the principal factors that differentiate us from our competitors are the following:


• | Superior IT research content – We believe that we create the broadest, highest-quality and most relevant research coverage of the IT industry, with offerings for every member of an IT organization. Our research analysis generates unbiased insight that we believe is timely, thought-provoking and comprehensive, and that is known for its high quality, independence and objectivity.


• | Our leading brand name – We have provided critical, trusted insight under the Gartner name for over 35 years.


• | Our global footprint and established customer base – We have a global presence with clients in over 90 countries on six continents. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of the United States.


• | Experienced management team – Our management team is composed of research veterans and experienced industry executives with long tenure at Gartner.


• | Substantial operating leverage in our business model — We have the ability to distribute our intellectual property and expertise across multiple platforms, including research publications, consulting engagements, conferences and executive programs, to derive incremental revenue and profitability.


• | Vast network of analysts and consultants – As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,922 research analysts and consultants located around the world. Our analysts collectively speak 50 languages and are located in 26 countries, enabling us to cover all aspects of IT on a global basis.

Notwithstanding these differentiating factors, we face competition from a significant number of independent providers of information products and services. We compete indirectly with consulting firms and other information providers, including electronic and print media companies. These indirect competitors could choose to compete directly with us in the future. In addition, we face competition from free sources of information that are available to our clients through the Internet. Limited barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we do business. As a result, new competitors may emerge and existing competitors may start to provide additional or complementary services. While we believe the breadth and depth of our research assets position us well versus our competition, increased competition could result in loss of market share, diminished value in our products and services, reduced pricing, and increased sales and marketing expenditures.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success has resulted in part from proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. We have policies related to confidentiality, ownership, and the use and protection of Gartner’s intellectual property. We also enter into agreements with our employees as appropriate that protect our intellectual property, and we enforce these agreements if necessary. We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create and protect it. Additionally, we actively monitor and enforce contract compliance by our end users.
