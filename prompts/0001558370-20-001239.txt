 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are an entrepreneurial specialty insurance company that since our founding in 2009 have built products, services and solutions with the goal of significantly improving the experience and value proposition for our customers. Our main office is located in Morristown, New Jersey and our common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “PROS”.
 We are led by a highly experienced and entrepreneurial team with decades of insurance leadership experience at the Company and other leading insurers. We write property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance with a focus on underwriting specialty risks by partnering with a select number of distributors, often on an exclusive basis. We have a diverse business mix covering specialty niches within the eight customer segments in which we operate. We market and distribute our insurance product offerings in all 50 states within the United States of America, on both an admitted and non-admitted basis. We are focused on delivering consistent underwriting profitability with low volatility of underwriting results.
 Our History
 We were founded in 2009 by members of the current management team and secured capital commitments from affiliates of each of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”) and TPG Global, LLC (“TPG”). We established our insurance operating platform and acquired our insurance subsidiaries through the acquisition of New York Marine and General Insurance Company (“New York Marine”) in 2010. We write insurance out of three subsidiaries: New York Marine, Gotham Insurance Company (“Gotham”) and Southwest Marine and General Insurance Company (“Southwest Marine”). New York Marine is admitted in 50 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Southwest

Marine is licensed in 49 states and Washington D.C. and is eligible to write on a non-admitted basis in New York. Gotham is admitted in New York and is eligible to write on a non-admitted basis in 49 states and Puerto Rico.
 The insurance subsidiaries participate in a risk sharing pool managed by ProSight Specialty Management Company (“PSMC”). This structure allows us to leverage the efficiencies of having a single vehicle managing operations and providing back-office services across our business. All premiums, losses and expenses written by our insurance subsidiaries are pooled and then are allocated to these three insurance subsidiaries in accordance with their respective pool participation percentages. The pool participation percentages are 80% for New York Marine, 15% for Gotham and 5% for Southwest Marine.
 In 2011, we formed a Bermuda holding company structure and acquired several entities in the United Kingdom in order to build Lloyd’s Syndicate 1110 (“Syndicate”). By 2016, however, we concluded that our business model’s emphasis on niche expertise and exclusive distribution, as well as our high profit expectations, made for an inappropriate fit with the Lloyd’s marketplace on a cost-effective basis. In 2017, we placed the Syndicate into run-off, and then entered into a two-phase sale transaction to exit our U.K. operations, which closed in October 2017 and March 2018. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations on this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Prior to July 25, 2019, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of ProSight Global Holdings Limited (“PGHL”), a Bermuda holding company.  Effective July 25, 2019, prior to the completion of the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”), PGHL merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the merger). The prior holders of PGHL’s equity interests (other than holders of PGHL profit interests known as “P Shares”) received in the aggregate, as merger consideration, the right to receive 6.46 shares of the Company’s common stock for each such outstanding PGHL equity interest. The total merger consideration was 38,851,369 shares of the Company’s common stock, which then comprised 100% of the shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock. All P Shares then outstanding were forfeited in connection with the IPO.
 As a result of the merger, the assets and liabilities of the Company include, effective July 25, 2019, the assets and liabilities of PGHL. In addition, on July 24, 2019, in connection with the merger, the Company’s duly adopted amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) became effective, providing for, among other things, the authorization of 200,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. All share and per share amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes have been restated for all historical periods presented to give effect to the merger and related conversion of shares, including reclassifying an amount equal to the change in value of common stock to additional paid-in capital, as well as the effectiveness of the Certificate of Incorporation.
 Prior to the merger, PGHL’s subsidiaries ProSight Specialty International Holdings Limited (“PSIH”) and ProSight Specialty European Holdings Limited (“PSEH”) were merged with and into the Company, effective February 5, 2019.  Additionally, effective February 5, 2019, ProSight Specialty Bermuda Limited (“PSBL”) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to February 5, 2019, PSBL was a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSEH.
 Our Customer Segments and Niches
 We define ourselves by the customer segments and niches we serve. We deliver our value and risk solutions through coverages, services we provide and third-party solutions that are attractive to our customers. We utilize our expertise in underwriting and claims to opportunistically pursue profit opportunities. 
 We currently write insurance coverage in eight customer segments across a broad range of specialty lines of business. Our customer segments currently include: Media and Entertainment, Real Estate, Professional Services, Transportation, Construction, Consumer Services, Marine and Energy, and Sports. Within each customer segment, we have multiple niches which represent similar groups of customers. We believe having deep expertise in these niches across our organization is critical and therefore, we have aligned various functional areas at the niche level, including within underwriting, operations and claims. We focus on small- and medium-sized customers, a market segment which we believe has been, and will continue to be, less affected by intense competitive dynamics of the broader P&C

insurance industry. On January 28, 2020, the Company announced that it will expand its insurance solutions portfolio into the captive insurance market.
 From time to time we reallocate existing niches to new or different customer segments in order to align them more efficiently, for reasons that may include the evolution of business or customers in that niche, the establishment or discontinuance of related niches, changes in responsibilities of our management team handling the segments, among others.  All historical customer segment information is presented in accordance with the current composition of our customer segments and such reallocation of premium amounts, and as a result some customer segment information may differ from amounts previously reported.
     Over time, the composition of business within our customer segments evolves as we identify certain niches that present opportunities to develop distinct customer solutions with attractive profit potential and others that were at one time attractive but may become less so. We believe our ability to remain nimble during changing market conditions is one of our key competitive advantages.
 Our eight customer segments are described below:
 Media and Entertainment
 Our Media and Entertainment customer segment offers solutions to customers engaged directly in the film production and live media. We provide full support for our Media and Entertainment customers’ commercial insurance needs, including package policies (property and general liability), umbrella and excess, auto, workers’ compensation, and specialized productions (cast, props, sets and wardrobe). Our Media and Entertainment customers benefit from our experience and expertise through our offerings of differentiated coverages and can take advantage of innovative products such as SecureMed® and Music Mends®.
 Our expertise in this customer segment comes from understanding the specific risks and requirements our media customers face, such as the unique equipment they employ. This expertise has enabled us to develop innovative solutions for our Media and Entertainment customers, which helps our customers manage risk. Our niches in the Media and Entertainment customer segment currently are:

We address our insureds’ unique needs through various specialized offerings, including flexible policy periods, project specific policies and all line solutions covering special considerations, such as hotel amenities.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  GWP for our Construction customer segment was $117.9 million and $101.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 Consumer Services
 Our Consumer Services customer segment works with a number of consumer-centric organizations, including many not-for-profit organizations. We provide our Consumer Services customers with workers’ compensation, package, umbrella and excess and commercial auto coverage.
 Our Consumer Services customer segment primarily focuses on identifying and crafting policies and solutions for the nuanced risks generated from the manner in which these customers’ employees or volunteers engage with their customers or clients. We offer differentiated solutions to our Consumer Services customers through our diversity of offerings and products and services, specific to each niche.

 Marine and Energy
 We offer a broad array of very specialized coverages to customers that own or service assets in the maritime trades, the upstream energy space both on and off shore and the growing solar energy sector. Our policies in the Marine and Energy customer segment generally focus on third party liabilities arising out of property damage and bodily injury, but, consistent with our overall approach to insurance, we also cover more subtle, distinctive risks that arise in each niche. Our differentiators in the Marine and Energy customer segment include our cost of iron endorsement and equipment rental coverage.
 We view the Marine and Energy customer segment as being well-suited to our emphasis on using industry expertise and highly tailored coverages to create value for our customers. For example, we recognize that solar contractors often face risk of professional liability arising out of their design of solar energy production systems and we view this distinct risk profile as an opportunity to craft customized coverages for such customers. Our niches in the Marine and Energy customer segment where we generate bespoke solutions currently include:

· | Ocean Marine. Providing marine umbrella and excess, property, protection and indemnity, pollution liability, marine cargo, vessel hull and machinery, marine liability, inland marine, maritime employers liability, workers’ compensation, and charterer’s liability coverage to customers with over the water or maritime exposures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to September 30, 2019, our Propane & Fuel Dealers niches were part of our Transportation customer segment. This niche is now part of our Marine and Energy customer segment.
 Sports
 We use our deep industry expertise to offer a wide range of flexible coverages that meet the complex and evolving needs of our Sports customer segment.

We created comprehensive insurance and risk management solutions from participant and spectator liability to shell corporations for professional athletes in the public eye. 

 
  10
 

     Our policies focus on general liability, workers’ compensation, participant accident, commercial auto, excess liability and drone liability. Differentiators and added value services include e-waivers, a more efficient process to collect, store and manage waivers, as well as payment programs that allow racetracks and motorsport facilities to take rain-out credits in advance. Our niches in the Sports customer segment include Aquatic Recreation, Country Clubs, Sports and Motor Sports. Our niches in the Sports customer segment where we develop such tailored coverages currently include:

· | Motor Sports. Providing general liability, property, workers’ compensation, umbrella and excess, auto, inland marine, and crime coverage for motor sporting events. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  GWP for our Sports customer segment was $30.1 million and $23.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Prior to September 30, 2019, our Motor Sports and Country Clubs niches were part of our Media and Entertainment customer segment. Such niches are now part of our Sports customer segment.
 Other
 “Other” includes all GWP from exited niches, developing customer segments that remain immaterial, certain fronting reinsurance arrangements, and participation in pools and associations. “Other” GWP primarily consists of the following components:
· | Primary and excess workers’ compensation coverage for self-insured groups sourced through Midlands, a managing general underwriter (“MGU”) that was acquired by a third-party insurance carrier in January 2019. We wrote business sourced through Midlands since our acquisition of New York Marine in 2010, including $69.1 million of GWP for the year ended December 31, 2019. Because we acquired this business in connection with our founding and did not develop it organically, the business sourced through Midlands lacked the differentiation that we would develop as part of any new niche we have entered since our founding. Due to these factors, coupled with certain unfavorable general market conditions for excess workers’ compensation, we decided to exit this niche in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, we do not anticipate any future premiums from this business after the first quarter of 2019 beyond premium adjustments from existing policies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Niches which we have terminated, the majority were focused on commercial auto such as Long Haul Trucking, Towing, Chauffeured Transportation, Settlement Carriers and Pizza Delivery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Participation in industry pools and associations, the largest of which is the National Council on Compensation Insurance (“NCCI”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  GWP related to “Other” was $68.2 million and $124.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following competitive strengths have supported our success to date and provide a foundation for future growth:

· | Focus on profitable niches of the market where we have industry leading expertise and can deliver value to our customers. We have been selective in developing our niches within customer segments for which we have in-house expertise and will continue to focus on providing differentiated products, services and solutions that truly serve customer needs and offer attractive and profitable growth opportunities. We have a strong focus on fragmented and underserved markets which we believe have an attractive risk-adjusted return profile. We choose to avoid markets that are susceptible to commoditization by incumbent industry participants. We have specific and unique expertise such as underwriting knowledge and data, loss mitigation techniques, customer access, and claims handling for each niche that we believe are difficult to replicate. We believe that this expertise enables us to accurately price risk, deliver profitable underwriting results, and retain this profitable business. We have aligned our organization accordingly such that our underwriting, operational and claims personnel are dedicated to specific niches within a given customer segment, which differentiates us and we believe is an important component of our financial performance. Our niche focus provides several important benefits to our underwriting results: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Homogeneous insureds. We believe that the inherent homogenous nature of insureds within a relatively narrow and descriptive niche means that collectively the actuarial result will be more credible and more susceptible to analysis, should results suggest that improvements or changes are required. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expertise in execution. Unlike many of our competitors, our communication is delivered directly to the underwriter or MGU who deals exclusively with the applicable customer rather than through layers of generic management and geographic leadership teams to underwriters that only occasionally touch such a niche. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Predetermined aggregations and exposure profiles at the niche level. When we launch a new niche, significant diligence and research is performed. This allows us to impose aggregation limits, price targets for catastrophic loss loads and/or buy appropriate reinsurance before the first account is written in the niche, which we believe results in a more predictable and profitable growth pattern for our niches. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Creation of products, services and solutions that deliver a high value proposition to our customers. We believe we will continue to succeed by proactively developing what we refer to as “differentiators,” which can be in the form of products, services, or solutions that are tailored to our customers. We often partner with our customers and distributors when developing differentiators and leverage their particular knowledge of their own needs and the needs of their customers, respectively. Unlike typical insurance companies, we co-own the intellectual property associated with the differentiators developed with our distributors during the term of our contractual relationships, allowing for a better alignment of incentives. We have dozens of differentiators across our niches, with many differentiators applicable to multiple niches. Examples of our differentiators include a customer solution called SecureFleet®, which provides video camera devices for commercial vehicles to monitor driver behavior and manage claim activity. This solution is available to customers across multiple niches. We believe our customers place meaningful value on the collective offering of differentiators we provide, which distinguishes us in the market. In addition, we aim for and achieve an exceptional customer service experience, as supported by over ten thousand survey responses since June 2017 with 92% rating the experience as “awesome” and 99% as “awesome” or “good”. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sophisticated underwriting tools that deliver prompt underwriting responses and profitable results. We have developed a multi-faceted pricing strategy that is tightly integrated into niche development, from inception to maturity. Pricing begins when a new niche is identified and submitted for 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  12
 

internal review and approval by underwriting and actuarial management, which we believe produces a filtering mechanism that helps us pursue only the opportunities best aligned with our strategy. For those niches that make it through the submission process, targets and metrics are established immediately to monitor the early development of the niche. We believe such monitoring allows for early detection of anomalies which can then quickly be remedied by the underwriting team. We employ our ProSight Climber GPS application to conduct such monitoring and review of our underwriting and reserving decisions on a real-time basis. Each niche undergoes a detailed annual pricing analysis that is utilized in the niche review process. These reviews incorporate a wide range of inputs such as trend, development, price change, underwriting changes, and claims results. We are highly selective in choosing which new opportunities to pursue; we estimate that we decline approximately 80% of the opportunities we evaluate. We believe that this comprehensive and collaborative approach results in profitable growth for us.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Long-standing and selective relationships with our distribution partners. We have designed an innovative distribution model with a highly targeted customer focus by engaging a limited number of distribution partners. For each niche, we partner with either a single or a select group of specialist distributors who have a deep understanding of our customers and their risk profiles. Each of our distribution partners undergoes a rigorous due diligence process before they are selected. In many of our niches, our agency and brokerage relationships are structured so that we work with a particular distribution partner on an exclusive basis. More than 70% of our 2019 GWP was produced on such an exclusive basis. Our goal is to structure distribution relationships so that we are aligned with the distributor towards achieving scale and underwriting profit in our customer segments, and they are compensated accordingly. By offering exclusivity and an aligned compensation structure, we incentivize our distributors to deliver value to our customers and offer them an advantage over generalist agents.

 We have instilled this entrepreneurial mentality throughout all levels of our Company. Our employees are encouraged to be proactive, to service our customers and distributors and ensure the success of our Company. We believe our people are our greatest strength, and we work consistently to foster a culture emphasizing customer focus, professional growth, accountability, and performance. This mentality is built into the mechanisms of our employee assessment and compensation. For example, to assess performance, we developed our proprietary “Climber Portal”, a cloud-based, branded internet suite that includes a nine-factor competency-based review system in which employees and their managers assess performance based on skills-strength and actual contributions. In this manner, performance is documented throughout the year in an ongoing interactive dialogue.

· | Deep investment in and innovative approach to technology. Technology is a core competency of the Company and at the heart of how we deliver our high value customer proposition. We have an exclusively configured, scalable, and digitally-enabled technology platform built for growth, data integrity, and efficiency, which allows us to deploy the necessary technologies to respond quickly to business opportunities. We have invested in the development of a modern core insurance system for policy administration and billing that forms the foundation of our customer facing digital technologies. As a result, we can rapidly develop flexible, customer facing solutions. We have demonstrated our ability to develop and deploy digital products for our agents and customers that are delivered via the web over desktop and mobile devices. We consider our ability to meet ever increasing customer demands for anytime, anywhere access as a competitive strength compared to traditional and emerging carriers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The key features of our technology, which support our business model are: (i) We are not burdened by multiple legacy systems and are therefore able to quickly respond to changing industry dynamics and focus our information technology (“IT”) investments on innovation. (ii) Our core customer-facing policy administration and billing systems, “ProSight Premiere”, have been architected and developed by us, and are internally maintained, to meet the needs of our growing insurance business. (iii) Through our exclusive enterprise data warehouse and financial reporting system “ProSight Climber GPS”, we have the ability to access and mine data to manage our business and help inform our underwriting and reserving decisions on a real-time basis. (iv) Our application programming interface (“API”)-enabled core systems and strong mobile development capabilities allow our customers and agents to interact with us in an easy and efficient manner. Our interactive platform, ProSight Online, is available to all of our customers and allows them to view policy, billing, claims and loss information, all from a mobile device. (v) Our unified cloud infrastructure enables us to operate our platform efficiently, deploy new services rapidly, and scale for the future.

· | Scalable platform built for continued growth. We have built our systems, processes and technology platform to be easily scalable with limited incremental marginal cost, as we see multiple opportunities to grow our business at a rate that is well in excess of the broader P&C insurance industry. Our licensing, infrastructure and applications have been designed to support a significantly larger book of business, and also have the ability to manage a high volume of small business customers through our proprietary direct to consumer technology platform. We currently have a competitive expense ratio that we expect to decrease over time as we expand our premium base and diversify our distribution channels that are available to cover the largely fixed costs of maintaining this infrastructure. Our absence of legacy infrastructure and systems means we can direct our spending towards expanding our technology leadership rather than maintenance and upkeep of outdated technology. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Strategy
 Our objective is to leverage our competitive strengths to achieve profitable and sustainable growth. We have built a large, diversified and seasoned in-force book of business. Our strategy is built on the following principles:
· | Utilize our specialized products, services and solutions to continue our growth trajectory in markets where we exhibit expertise. We have been selective in developing our target niches and will continue to focus on providing differentiators within niches that we believe offer attractive and profitable growth opportunities. We expect future growth to come from three primary areas. (i) We have robust growth opportunities in existing niches where we seek to deepen our presence. We have historically experienced profitable growth in these lines. (ii) We expect to selectively enter new niches within our existing customer 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  14
 

segments, particularly those where we have developed expertise and a new adjacent niche provides a unique opportunity. (iii) We expect to remain nimble during changing market conditions and enter new customer segments as we identify a sector of the marketplace that presents an attractive opportunity. Generally, we believe that our differentiation and the value propositions we generate for our customers through our niche-by-niche growth strategy creates a profit opportunity for us.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand multi-pronged distribution network to best serve our customers in the most efficient and effective manner. We have the ability to deliver our products through three channels: (i) third party partnerships via retail agents or MGUs with whom we customarily have long-standing relationships; (ii) our owned brokerage arm, ProSight Specialty Insurance Brokerage; and (iii) our proprietary direct to consumer technology platform. We do not experience any channel conflicts as each one of our specialized niches is only distributed through one channel. When developing a niche, we choose the channel that is most suited to reach the target customer. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain strong underwriting discipline and profitability. We seek to maintain underwriting profitability while pursuing sustainable growth through a robust risk selection process. Our underwriting teams are led by experts in the niches we serve and we target niche markets that are homogeneous blocks of actuarially credible businesses that have performed at favorable loss ratios. We will continue to focus exclusively on business with an attractive risk-adjusted return profile and will not participate in markets that are commoditized and where we cannot add incremental value. All of the underwriting authority and guidelines, for every niche and customer segment, are determined and approved by our CURO. The majority of our GWP from customer segments are executed by the Company’s underwriters who are experts in their specific niche, while the remainder is handled by our MGUs, subject to the authority that the CURO has delegated to them. All of our underwriting authority delegated to MGUs is subject to stringent guidelines and regular audits. Our strong focus on underwriting expertise has led to favorable financial results. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated net income from continuing operations of $45.5 million and adjusted operating income from continuing operations of $57.6 million which resulted in an adjusted operating return on equity from continuing operations for the same period of 12.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated net income from continuing operations of $53.7 million and adjusted operating income from continuing operations of $55.3 million which resulted in an adjusted operating return on equity from continuing operations for the same period of 14.4%. Our portfolio has delivered a net loss ratio of 64% since the Company’s inception. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage our technology platform to drive operational efficiencies and digital capabilities. We have built an IT platform that encompasses a streamlined core system suite, customized digital solutions, and scalable and resilient cloud infrastructure. We have made significant investments to build out robust data capture capabilities that allow for a dynamic rate and loss management process as datasets evolve. Additionally, our flexible platform is able to seamlessly underwrite and onboard new business as we continue to expand. We believe we are well positioned to grow in an evolving shared economy with our exclusive technology infrastructure. Our expense ratio can decrease as we expand our business, as our platform provides us with a high degree of operational leverage. We plan to maintain and expand our technology leadership by developing new tools and applications for our distribution partners and customers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain our strong balance sheet. We believe a conservative balance sheet is foundational to our ability to deliver superior financial performance and returns. We have continuously maintained a rigorous reserving approach and monitor loss emergence and developments on a monthly basis in addition to our detailed quarterly reviews and daily monitoring by executive management. We protect our capital by utilizing high-quality reinsurers, setting retentions appropriate to the extent and nature of exposures we wish to retain, maintaining a strong enterprise risk management framework, closely monitoring regulatory and market developments, and adapting our approach to achieve our underwriting and risk management goals. We also follow a conservative investment portfolio management philosophy consistent with our objective to achieve consistent and predictable profitability through a careful analysis of risk and return. We believe that our investment portfolio provides sufficient liquidity to pay for the liabilities relating to the

risks we underwrite while achieving attractive returns on investment. We have a high-quality, well-diversified investment portfolio with 95.7% invested in fixed maturities and an average credit quality rating of “A” as of December 31, 2019. We also will seek to maintain a competitive rating with A.M. Best, where our insurance subsidiaries are currently rated “A-” (Excellent) (Outlook Stable), which is the fourth highest of 16 ratings assigned by A.M. Best to insurance companies. Maintaining a strong rating from A.M. Best enables us to easily demonstrate our financial strength to policyholders, which is often a critical factor in the decision to purchase insurance. This rating is intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer’s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and is not an evaluation directed at investors with respect to our securities.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Distribution and Marketing
 While many of our competitors choose to distribute their products through thousands of producers, we currently work with fewer than 20 MGUs and fewer than 125 wholesalers and retailers. Each distributor is often appointed for a specific niche only. Typically, our distribution partners have an existing book of business, are well-established experts in a niche and have a deep understanding of our offering. We also complement our external distribution capabilities with ProSight Specialty Insurance Brokerage, our owned brokerage arm, and our proprietary, online, direct-to-customer platform.
 Unlike most other insurance companies, we typically offer our distribution partners exclusive or semi-exclusive access to our products within that niche. This exclusivity is in contrast to their typical experience, where the insurance company offers its product through hundreds or thousands of competing distributors. Agents highly value this exclusivity as it enables them to grow their business with fewer constraints and work with a partner who has a vested interest in their growth, which we believe leads to well-aligned incentives for our distributors. This enables us to collaborate closely with the producer to create and develop products and solutions specific to the niche. In exchange for exclusivity for the distributors, we typically have some combination of geographic exclusivity, right-of-first-refusal placement within the agency and control of our developed intellectual property. This intellectual property arrangement is part of our distributor agreement, enabling us in most cases to retain the right either to exclusively pursue or to compete for our customers in the event that an MGU chooses to terminate our relationship. In each case, we maintain the right to compete more generally in the niche.
 Several of these agents are responsible for a significant portion of the premium written by us. While this model provides many benefits to us and our customers, such agents have in the past, and may in the future elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, or reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, including as a result of industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Third-party agents we rely upon to distribute certain business on our behalf may not perform as anticipated, or may be acquired or terminate their agreements with us which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 To support our marketing and distribution efforts, we invest in building brand awareness and brand preference within our target niches. Our marketing team works closely with our distribution partners to develop joint marketing plans and digital marketing campaigns that support the growth goals of the program. In addition, we focus on developing relationships with professional associations and other affinity groups to create additional distribution and branding opportunities for our programs and distribution partners. The goal of these marketing efforts is to accelerate organic growth and create loyalty among our distribution partners.
 Underwriting, Risk Selection and Pricing
 All underwriting authority comes from the Board of Directors and is delegated to the CURO. All of the underwriting authority and guidelines, for every niche and customer segment, are determined and approved by our CURO. This ensures that the Company has complete determination over what an acceptable risk is for every niche. The majority of our GWP from customer segments are executed by the Company’s underwriters who are experts in their specific niche, while the remainder is handled by our MGUs, subject to the authority that the CURO has delegated to them. All of our underwriting authority delegated to MGUs is subject to stringent guidelines and regular audits.

 
  16
 

 All of the operational and execution-related aspects for each niche are subject to final approval from our CURO and are captured in our distributor agreements. The CURO conducts regular reviews of each niche throughout the year to ensure that the execution in each niche remains consistent with expectations. Daily and monthly metrics at the niche level are readily available to each underwriter and are utilized to track progress.
 Niche Focus
 Our niche focus provides several important benefits to our underwriting results:

· | Homogeneous Insureds. This is a critical advantage to our underwriting approach. We believe that the inherent homogenous nature of insureds within a relatively narrow and descriptive niche means that collectively the actuarial result will be more credible and more susceptible to analysis, should results suggest that improvements or changes are required. Our data and reporting structures also align around niches, enabling us to better evaluate under- or over-performance. This granular focus allows underwriters and the product development team to be more tailored and specific when responding to customer needs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expertise in Execution. Our underwriters operate at a niche level. Being niche focused enables us to adjust our approach and/or execution more efficiently. Unlike many of our competitors, directives regarding a specific niche need not be communicated through layers of generic management and geographic leadership teams to underwriters that only occasionally touch such a niche. Our communication is delivered directly to the underwriter or MGU that deals exclusively with the applicable customer. We believe there is tremendous benefit to our results in that deep expertise and simplicity. We are also able to better track and account for costs directly associated with a niche, improving our ability to determine price adequacy and a given niche’s profitability. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Predetermined Aggregations and Exposure Profiles at the Niche Level. When we launch a new niche, the CURO tightly controls the authority process. Significant diligence and research are performed prior to moving forward with a niche. For every new niche, this means that test quotes have been completed, actuarial data assessed, filings considerations contemplated, regulatory concerns discussed, IT systems issues identified, reinsurance ramifications explored and many other matters vetted, all prior to approval. Key among these is an understanding of any aggregations of exposures that might occur due to timing or geographic bias of the customer base. Knowing these portfolio characteristics before the first account is written allows us to impose aggregation limits, price targets for catastrophic loss loads and/or buy appropriate reinsurance. We believe that this results in a more predictable and profitable growth pattern for our niches. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  General Underwriting Controls
 The CURO delegates authority to our underwriters and MGUs based on the niche assigned to each underwriter, the experience of that individual and the role the individual has in the organization.
 Each niche has a dedicated underwriting manager, specific underwriting appetite guidelines and controls focused on making sure that accounts written are within the parameters established for each niche. We have a series of processes utilized by underwriters and management on a daily, monthly and quarterly basis that, when added together, ensure the execution and compliance of each niche. Management drives results in a variety of ways, including:

· | Peer Reviews. We mandate that a sampling of files is reviewed per niche per quarter by the supervising manager. This applies to policies written under delegated authority as well as internally written policies. Results are tracked for training and performance purposes. This is designed to give the underwriting manager a more holistic picture as to the performance of the underwriter and the niche. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exception Reports. We actively monitor the parameters of each niche by using online alerts to notify the CURO and underwriting staff if selected issuance values are entered that fall outside preselected parameters. Each niche has its own exception parameters depending on the appetite for that niche. In 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  17
 

addition, the CURO and underwriting teams review the transaction log every week, focusing on activities that could be incorrect or fraudulent, such as a claim with back-dated coverage, or unusual cancellations or reinstatements.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Daily Claims Tracking. All underwriters and management have daily access to the claims activity from the previous day, in addition to the historical claims information for each niche. This provides instant feedback to each underwriter as to how their niche is performing and better enables them to adjust execution and make timely decisions to improve our profitability. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Underwriting Audit. We maintain an underwriting audit staff that reports to the CURO. Every niche and related MGU is audited at least every 24 months, with most being on an annual cycle. An MGU for any new niche is audited within the first twelve months. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Niche Reviews/Actual-to-Plan Discussions. We hold regular review meetings, led by the CURO, which cover underwriting performance, actuarial pricing trends, loss development trends, and distribution strategy and differentiation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Overall, we believe that these processes and controls, in addition to our niche focus, give us industry-leading insights that improve our underwriting execution to deliver more accurate, stable and predictable underwriting results.
 Technology
 From our founding, we believed that our technology serves as an important source of competitive advantage. It is our view that much of the industry has lagged in technology development despite investing large amounts of money into IT transformation programs, often having dozens of policy administration systems and claims systems for various business units and product lines that do not effectively communicate with one another and are not organized around the customer. We believe the result is that our competitors bear the costs of maintaining these disparate systems but struggle to effectively organize their data or processes in a way that can be provisioned to customers to create valuable digital services.
 In contrast, we have built a modern technology platform that is efficient, scalable, and enables industry-leading digital capabilities. This platform provides the following major advantages:
 We are not burdened by legacy systems. After the acquisition of New York Marine, and concurrent with the development of our new policy administration system, we focused on the retirement and replacement of legacy systems to ensure that we could reduce costs and eliminate the limitations associated with these older systems.
 Our key customer facing systems were developed recently on modern architectures. Our policy administration system, which we call “ProSight Premiere”, supports all of our various customer segments. The system was built to enable custom rate, rules and forms by niche in a manner that is highly flexible and configurable by our own internal development staff. In order to support the various market opportunities we may pursue, the system currently supports nine product lines, 50 states, admitted and non-admitted business, and Insurance Services Office and American Association of Insurance Services, and proprietary approaches. The system handles submission and clearance, rating, quoting, issuance and all endorsement and audit transactions required for the life of the policy. The flexibility of the system and our in-house expertise enables us to fully configure most new niches in a short period. The systems, and our staffing in support of it, has been architected to ensure ease of scalability and costs being largely fixed, affording significant operational leverage as we grow.
 Our Enterprise Data Warehouse and proprietary Business Intelligence system drives our day-to-day business decisions. We have developed “ProSight Climber GPS” to provide our decision makers with real-time access to detailed premium and loss data for all aspects of our business as well as customized reports and dashboards that provide the information they need to make good business decisions in a timely manner. This capability is delivered to authorized employees’ desktops via their web browser and is connected to various data sources across the Company. In-house development resources are continuously enhancing this system to improve its capability.

 
  18
 

 Our technology platform supports our digital business initiatives. All of our key customer facing systems are API- enabled and highly available to support the development of customer and agent facing mobile applications that can be used anytime, anywhere. Our various proprietary digital products link directly to these core systems via APIs that are developed and maintained in-house. This enables us to deliver real-time data to our customers and agents and enable transactions that are directly executed by the systems, eliminating the need for back-office operations to manually process the requests.
 Our unified cloud infrastructure is efficient, scalable and supports innovation. In 2016, we migrated all of our company infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. As a result, we were able to reduce infrastructure costs over the course of the migration while significantly enhancing our backup, disaster recovery, and application availability. In the future, we expect this cloud infrastructure will enable us to scale our business without the need for capital investment in building and maintaining physical data centers.
 We believe these components, and the general philosophy of maintaining in-house expertise and capability for core activities to be a significant competitive advantage. By not relying on a fully outsourced application development and maintenance model, we believe we can sustainably deliver higher quality systems and services at a faster pace and lower cost than our competitors.
 Claims Management
 Our dedicated staff have expertise that aligns with the business of our customers, which enables our claims department to create differentiated outcomes for the specific needs of our customers. Our claims department works closely with our underwriting team in order to provide customers with strong partnerships. We are guided by the following principles: (i) prompt, proactive and comprehensive investigations of each claim; (ii) engaging customers in the claims process; (iii) establishing reserves reflective of our estimate of probable case value; and (iv) proactively identifying and pursuing subrogation opportunities and the investigation of fraud.  We utilize specialized, independent law firms to defend litigation filed against our insureds.
 We strive to handle as many claims as possible through our internal claims staff and to make minimal use of Third-Party Administrators (“TPAs”). We utilize the services of two TPAs to assist in the adjustment of workers’ compensation claims and one TPA to assist in the adjustment of builders’ risk claims within the Real Estate customer segment. Our TPAs are not affiliated with our distribution partners. Other than in limited cases, our MGUs do not handle claims. Our internal claims managers oversee TPA and MGU claims-related activities and monitor their individual claim handling activities to prescribed ProSight standards.
 Reinsurance
 We actively use ceded reinsurance across our book of business to reduce our overall risk position and to protect our capital. Reinsurance involves a primary insurance company transferring, or “ceding,” a portion of its premium and losses in order to limit its exposure. The ceding of liability to a reinsurer does not relieve the obligation of the primary insurance to the policyholder. The primary insurer remains liable for the entire loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement. In 2019, we ceded $115.9 million, or 12.0% of our GWP to reinsurers. We attempt to purchase reinsurance from reinsurers that are rated at least “A-” (Excellent) or better by A.M. Best.

 
  19
 

 The following table provides our top three reinsurers by uncollateralized net reinsurance receivable (paid and unpaid) as of December 31, 2019:

 | Uncollateralized | | 
 | Net Reinsurance Receivable | | 
 | (Paid and Unpaid) | | 
 | as of December 31, 2019 | | 
Reinsurer | ($ in thousands) | | A.M. Best Rating
Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation | $ | 44,797 | | A+
Munich Reinsurance America Inc. | $ | 20,320 | | A+
Harco National Insurance Company | $ | 12,906 | | A-

      We use various types of reinsurance, including quota share, excess of loss and facultative agreements, to spread the risk of loss among several reinsurers and to limit its exposure from losses on any one occurrence. Under our quota share reinsurance contracts, we cede a predetermined percentage of each risk for a class of business to the reinsurer and recover the same percentage of each loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”). We pay the reinsurer the same percentage of the original premium, less a ceding commission.
 Under our excess of loss reinsurance, we pay a reinsurance premium to the accepting reinsurer and, in return, cede all or a portion of the liability in excess of a predetermined deductible or retention. We generally do not receive any commission for ceding business under excess of loss reinsurance agreements.
 We purchase facultative reinsurance to provide coverage on selected individual risks not covered by our quota share and excess of loss reinsurance coverage or to increase our protection on selected individual risks in excess of the limits under our quota share and excess of loss reinsurance agreements. For a further discussion of our reinsurance, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Reinsurance and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business on this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Competition
 Due to our focus on specialized niches, our competitors vary from niche to niche. We compete with other specialty carriers within a given niche more often than general market insurers, but no specific specialty insurers can be identified as clear competition across all of our customer segments or niches. We estimate that in each of our niches we see meaningful competition from between two and five other market participants. Some specialty carriers we compete with today include OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd., Everest Re Group, Ltd., RLI Corp., Markel Corporation, W.R. Berkley Corporation, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. and James River Group Holdings, Ltd. In addition, many large generalist insurance companies have some specialty business as a subset of their overall operations with which we may compete on a niche basis. Such large carriers with specialty operations include Allianz SE, Chubb Ltd., CNA Financial Corporation, American International Group, Inc., The Travelers Companies and various London-based Lloyd’s syndicates.
 Traditionally, competition within the insurance industry focused on providing the lowest priced policies, with customers viewing insurance as a commodity. However, we believe we provide a superior offering which competes based more on value creation than just price.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 396 employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement. Available Information

 REGULATION
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at both the state and federal level, including regulation under state insurance and federal laws. We cannot predict the impact of future state or federal laws or regulations on our business. Future laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Insurance Regulation
 General
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the states in which they are domiciled, particularly with respect to their financial condition. New York Marine and Gotham are domiciled in New York where they are regulated and supervised by the New York Department of Financial Services (“NY DFS”). Southwest Marine is domiciled in Arizona where it is regulated and supervised by the Arizona Department of Insurance (“AZ DOI”). 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by all states in which they transact business, which oversight in practice often focuses on review of their market conduct. The extent and scope of insurance regulation varies between jurisdictions, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial security of insurers, including admittance of assets for purposes of calculating statutory surplus, standards of solvency, reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy and the business conduct of insurers.
 In addition, statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and, for certain lines of insurance, and the approval of rates. State statutes and regulations also prescribe the permitted types and concentrations of investments by insurers. The primary purpose of this insurance industry regulation is to protect policyholders. P&C insurance companies are required to file detailed quarterly and annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed or eligible to do business, and their operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. Regulators have discretionary authority, in connection with the continued licensing of insurance companies, to limit or prohibit the ability to issue new policies if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that an insurer is not maintaining minimum statutory surplus or capital or if the further transaction of business will be detrimental to its policyholders.
 The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay to their stockholders, without prior approval by their respective domestic insurance regulators, is restricted under the laws of New York and Arizona.
 Under New York law, the maximum amount of aggregate dividends that New York Marine or Gotham has authority to pay during any twelve month period without prior approval by the NY DFS is the lesser of (i) ten percent of each of New York Marine’s or Gotham’s respective surplus as shown on the last statutory financial statement on file with the Superintendent of Insurance, including quarterly statements, or (ii) one hundred percent of their respective adjusted net investment income during such twelve month period (where adjusted net investment income equals the net investment income for the 12-month period prior to the declaration or payment of the dividend plus the excess of net investment income over dividends paid in the two years prior thereto).
 Under Arizona law, the maximum amount of aggregate dividends that Southwest Marine has authority to pay during any 12-month period without prior approval by the AZ DOI is the greater of (i) ten percent of Southwest Marine’s surplus as of the immediately preceding December 31 or (ii) Southwest Marine’s net income for the 12‑month period ending the immediately prior December 31.
 In addition, payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to the Company by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of our insurance subsidiaries’ respective jurisdictions requiring that

each insurance subsidiary hold a specified amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on its outstanding policies. These regulations specify that the minimum reserves shall be calculated to be sufficient to meet future obligations, giving consideration for required future premiums to be received, which are based on certain specified interest rates and methods of valuation, which are subject to change.
 Insurance Holding Company Regulation
 The Company is an insurance holding company and it, together with its insurance subsidiaries and its other subsidiaries and affiliates, is subject to the insurance holding company system laws of New York and Arizona. These laws vary across jurisdictions, but generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the jurisdiction’s insurance regulatory authorities, to file reports disclosing certain information, including their capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, enterprise risk and own risk and solvency assessment.
 These laws also require disclosure of certain qualifying transactions between or among our insurance subsidiaries and the Company or any of our other subsidiaries or affiliates to which one or more of our insurance subsidiaries is a party. Such transactions could include loans, investments, sales, service agreements and reinsurance agreements among other similar inter-affiliate transactions. These laws also require that inter-company transactions be fair and reasonable. In certain circumstances, the insurance company must give prior notice of the transaction to the insurance department in its state of domicile, and the insurance department must either approve or disapprove the subject inter-company transaction within defined periods. Further, these laws require that an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any dividends or distributions to stockholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and its financial needs.
 The insurance holding company laws in some states, including New York and Arizona, require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s parent company. Generally, to obtain approval from the insurance commissioner for any acquisition of control of an insurance company or its parent company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding: (i) the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates; (ii) the nature, source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; (iii) the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates; (iv) any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; (v) the number and type of securities to be acquired; (vi) any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired; (vii) any agreements with broker-dealers; and (viii) other matters. Different jurisdictions may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions. Additional requirements may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control.
 Statutory Examinations
 We are required to file detailed quarterly and annual financial statements, in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules with regulatory officials in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, the NY DFS and AZ DOI conduct periodic detailed examinations, generally once every three to five years, of the books, records, accounts and operations of our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in their states. Financial Tests
 The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed a set of financial relationships or “tests”, known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”), which is designed for early identification of companies that may require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance companies submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data by utilizing ratios. State insurance regulators review this statistical report, which is available to the public, together with an analytical report, prepared by and available only to state insurance regulators, to identify insurance companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention. A “usual range” of results for each ratio is used as a benchmark.

 Risk-Based Capital Requirements
 In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for P&C insurers. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantively similar law. The NAIC Risk-Based Capital Model Act requires insurance companies to submit an annual RBC Report, which compares an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital with its Authorized Control Level RBC. A company’s RBC is calculated by using a specified formula that applies factors to various specified asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. The factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with less underlying risk.
 Total Adjusted Capital is defined as the sum of an insurer’s statutory capital and surplus and asset valuation reserve and the estimated amount of all dividends declared by the insurer’s board of directors prior to the end of the statement year that are not yet paid or due at the end of the year. The RBC Report is used by regulators to set in motion appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show indications of weak or deteriorating conditions. RBC is an additional standard for minimum capital requirements that insurers must meet to avoid being placed in rehabilitation or liquidation by regulators. The annual RBC Report, and the information contained therein, is not intended by the NAIC as a means to rank insurers.
 RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile. It provides a means of setting the capital requirement in which the degree of risk taken by the insurer is the primary determinant. The value of an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital in relation to its RBC, together with its trend in its Total Adjusted Capital, is used as a basis for determining regulatory action that a state insurance regulator may be authorized or required to take with respect to an insurer. The four determinations, potentially applicable under each jurisdiction’s laws, are essentially as follows:

· | Company Action Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is greater than or equal to 150% but less than 200% of RBC or Total Adjusted Capital greater than or equal to 200% but less than 250% of RBC, and has a negative trend. If there is a Company Action Level Event, the insurer must submit a plan (an RBC Plan) outlining, among other things, the corrective actions it intends to take in order to remedy its capital deficiency. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Regulatory Action Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is greater than or equal to 100% but less than 150% of RBC or the insurer has failed to comply with filing deadlines for its RBC Report or RBC Plan. If there is a Regulatory Action Level Event, the insurer is also required to submit an RBC Plan. In addition, the insurance regulator must undertake a comprehensive examination of the insurer’s financial condition and must issue any appropriate corrective orders. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Authorized Control Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is below RBC but greater than or equal to 70% of RBC or the insurer has failed to respond to a corrective order. As noted above, if there is an Authorized Control Level Event, the insurance regulator may seek rehabilitation or liquidation of the insurer if it deems it to be in the best interests of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer and the public. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mandatory Control Level Event. Total Adjusted Capital is below 70% of RBC. If there is a Mandatory Control Level Event, the insurance regulator must seek rehabilitation or liquidation of the insurer.

  Market Conduct
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic market conduct exams (“MCE”) in any jurisdiction where they do business. An MCE typically entails review of business activities, such as operations and management, complaint handling, marketing and sales, producer licensing, policyholder service, underwriting and rating, and claims handling. Regulators may impose fines and penalties upon finding violations of regulations governing such business activities.

 Rate and Form Approvals
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to each state’s laws and regulations regarding rate and form approvals. The applicable laws and regulations are used by states to establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. An insurer’s ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each state’s respective requirements. Assessments Against Insurers
 Under the insurance guaranty fund laws existing in each state, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, licensed insurers can be assessed by insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Most of these laws provide for annual limits on the assessments and for an offset against state premium taxes. These premium tax offsets must be spread over future periods ranging from five to 20 years. Since these assessments typically are not made for several years after an insurer fails and depend upon the final outcome of liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings, we cannot accurately determine the amount or timing of any future assessments. Regulation of Investments
 We are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amounts of investments in certain asset categories, such as below-investment grade fixed income securities, equity, real estate, other equity investments and derivatives. Failure to comply with these requirements and limitations could cause affected investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, could require the divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. Privacy Regulation
 Federal and state law and regulation require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate the use and disclosure of social security numbers and federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information. Cybersecurity Regulation
 The NY DFS issued a new regulation, effective March 1, 2017, that requires banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NY DFS, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State’s financial services industry. The cybersecurity regulation adds specific requirements for these institutions’ cybersecurity compliance programs and imposes an obligation to conduct ongoing, comprehensive risk assessments. Further, on an annual basis, each institution is required to submit a certification of compliance with these requirements. In addition to New York’s cybersecurity regulation, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law in October 2017. Under the model law, institutions that are compliant with the NY DFS cybersecurity regulation are deemed also to be in compliance with the model law. As of December 31, 2019, eight states have adopted the model law or a variation of it and other states are expected to consider adopting the model law or a variation of it in the near future. We expect that additional regulations could be enacted in other jurisdictions that could impact our cybersecurity program. Depending on these and other potential implementation requirements, we will likely incur additional costs of compliance. Bank Holding Company Act

     Due to the size of Goldman Sachs’ current voting and economic interest in us, we are deemed to be controlled by Goldman Sachs for purposes of the BHC Act and, therefore, are considered to be a “subsidiary” of Goldman Sachs under the BHC Act. Accordingly, we have agreed to certain covenants in the Stockholders’ Agreement (as later defined) for the benefit of Goldman Sachs that are intended to facilitate its compliance with the BHC Act, but that may impose certain obligations on us. Restrictions placed on Goldman Sachs as a result of supervisory or enforcement actions under the BHC Act or otherwise may restrict us or our activities in certain circumstances, even if these actions are unrelated to our conduct or business. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Risks, — We are subject to banking regulations that may limit our business activities, on this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
