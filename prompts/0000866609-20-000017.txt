Item 1. Business
ION is an innovative, asset light global technology company that delivers powerful data-driven decision-making offerings to offshore energy, ports and defense industries. We are entering a fourth industrial revolution where technology is fundamentally changing how decisions are made. Decision-making is shifting from what was historically an art to a science. Data, analytics and digitalization provide a step-change opportunity to translate information into insights to enhance decisions, gain a competitive edge and deliver superior returns. 
We have been a leading technology innovator for over 50 years. While the traditional focus of our cutting-edge technology has been on the exploration and production (“E&P”) industry, we are now broadening and diversifying our business into relevant adjacent markets such as offshore logistics, ports and harbors, defense and marine robotics. Our offerings are focused on improving subsurface knowledge to enhance E&P decision-making and enhancing situational awareness to optimize offshore operations. We have approximately 600 patents and pending patent applications in various countries around the world.
The Company is publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker IO. ION is headquartered in Houston, Texas with regional offices around the world. The company has approximately 500 employees, about half of whom are in technical roles and a quarter have advanced degrees.
During the first quarter of 2019, we consolidated our operating segments from three into two, eliminating the separate presentation of our Ocean Bottom Integrated Technologies segment. This consolidation aligns with our asset light business model and evolved strategy to commercialize 4Sea ocean bottom technologies instead of operating a crew. 
We provide our services and products through two business segments - E&P Technology & Services and Operations Optimization. In addition, we have a 49% ownership interest in our INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited (“INOVA Geophysical,” or “INOVA”), a joint venture with BGP Inc. (“BGP”), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (“CNPC”). BGP owns the remaining 51% equity interest in INOVA.
Our E&P Technology & Services segment creates digital data assets and delivers services to help E&P companies improve decision-making, reduce risk and maximize value. Across the E&P lifecycle, our E&P offerings focus on driving customer decisions, such as which blocks to bid on and for how much, how to maximize portfolio value, where to drill wells or how to optimize production.
Our Operations Optimization segment develops mission-critical subscription offerings and provides engineering services that enable operational control and optimization offshore. This segment is comprised of our Optimization Software & Services and Devices offerings. While we primarily sell to service providers, we began selling existing technology to new customers in E&P, ports and harbors, scientific, defense and academic industries. 
We historically conducted our land seismic equipment business through INOVA, which manufactures land seismic data acquisition systems, digital sensors, vibroseis vehicles (i.e., vibrator trucks), and energy source controllers. We wrote our investment in INOVA down to zero in 2014.
Services and Products
E&P Technology & Services. Our offerings are designed to help E&P companies improve decision-making, reduce risk and maximize value. Within our E&P Technology and Services segment, there are three synergistic groups: Imaging Services, E&P Advisors and Ventures. 
4


Our Imaging Services group provides advanced data processing and imaging services designed to maximize image quality and subsurface insights, helping E&P companies reduce exploration and production risk, evaluate and develop reservoirs, and increase production. Imaging Services continually develops and applies proprietary processing algorithms via its cutting-edge imaging engine to data owned or licensed by our customers to translate raw data into subsurface images. We continually enhance our novel workflows and invest in leading-edge infrastructure to efficiently deliver the best image quality.
While our Imaging Services group processes and images data for customers on a proprietary basis, the majority of these resources support our higher potential return multi-client business. The proprietary work we take on is complex, where our advanced technology is valued and where we closely collaborate with our customers to solve their toughest challenges, keeping our toolkit sharp. We maintain approximately 19 petabytes of digital seismic data storage in four global data centers, including a core data center located in Houston. We utilize a globally distributed network of Linux-cluster processing centers in combination with our major hubs in Houston and London to process seismic data using advanced, proprietary algorithms and workflows. 
Our E&P Advisors group partners with E&P operators, energy industry regulators and capital institutions to capture and monetize E&P opportunities worldwide. This group’s strategy is to provide technical, commercial and strategic advice across the exploration and production value chain, working at basin, prospect and field scales. E&P Advisors couples ION’s proven technical capabilities with the industry’s best commercial and strategic minds to deliver fit-for-purpose solutions, employing a variety of commercial models specific to our clients’ needs. In addition, the group drives value in our multi-client library by providing program assurance by understanding the technical, commercial, strategic and operational landscape to optimize our investments and seamlessly extends Imaging Services’ workflows into the reservoir.
Our Ventures group leverages the world-class geoscience skills of both the Imaging Services and E&P Advisors groups to create global digital data assets that are licensed to multiple E&P companies to optimize their investment decisions. Our global data library consists of over 714,000 km of 2D and over 350,000 sq. km of 3D multi-client seismic data in virtually all major offshore petroleum provinces. Ventures provides services to manage multi-client or proprietary surveys, from survey planning and design to data acquisition and management, to final subsurface imaging and reservoir characterization. We focus on the technologically intensive components of the image development process, such as survey planning and design, and data processing and interpretation, while outsourcing asset-intensive components (such as field acquisition) to experienced contractors.
We offer our services to customers on both a proprietary and multi-client (non-exclusive) basis. In both cases, a majority of our exposure to survey costs are generally pre-funded by our customers. The period during which our multi-client surveys are being designed, acquired or processed is referred to as the “New Venture” phase. Once the New Venture phase is completed, they become part of our data library. For proprietary services, the customer has exclusive ownership of the data. For multi-client surveys, we generally retain ownership of or long-term exclusive marketing rights to the data and receive ongoing revenue from subsequent data license sales. 
Operations Optimization. Our Operations Optimization segment develops mission-critical subscription offerings and provides engineering services that enable operational control and optimization offshore. Our advanced systems improve situational awareness, communication and risk management to enable rapid and informed decisions in challenging offshore environments. Our industry-leading mission management, navigation, communications and sensing technologies enable the operations of modern 3D towed streamer vessels. 
This segment is comprised of our Optimization Software & Services and Devices offerings. While we primarily sell to oil and gas service providers, we began selling existing technology to new customers in E&P, ports and harbors, scientific, defense and academic industries. Service providers rely on our industry-leading marine imaging systems and services to acquire the highest quality data - safely and efficiently - in both towed streamer and seabed operations. Our integrated technology platforms combined with advanced prediction tools enable safer, more efficient operations.
We also leverage our core competencies to develop custom solutions. Our capabilities include data management, navigation, software development, acoustics, sensing, telemetry, fluid dynamics, positioning and control devices and electrical and mechanical engineering expertise.
Our Optimization Software & Services group provides survey design, command and control software systems and related services for marine towed streamer and seabed operations. Our software business commands recurring, premium subscription revenues. We are market leaders in our core business and adapted our platform to more broadly optimize operations. Our software offerings leverage a leading data integration platform to control and optimize operations. Engineering services experts deliver in-field optimization services, equipment maintenance and training to maximize value from our offerings.

Command & Control System - Our command and control software for towed streamer acquisition, Orca, integrates acquisition, planning, positioning, source and quality control systems into a seamless operation. Gator is our integrated navigation and data management system for multi-vessel ocean bottom services, electromagnetic and transition zone operations. Orca and Gator both have modules that enable in-field survey optimization. These modules are designed to enable improved, safer acquisition through analysis and prediction of sea currents integrated with the operational plan.
Survey Planning and Design - We offer software and consulting services for planning and supervising complex surveys, including for 4D (time lapse) and wide-azimuth. Our acquisition expertise and MESA software platform enables clients, including both E&P companies and service providers, to optimize survey efficiency, data quality and costs. 
Optimization Software - Marlin is a cloud-based software designed to maximize the safety and efficiency of complex offshore operations by automatically integrating a variety of data sources in real-time with operational plans to improve situational awareness and decision making. Akin to air traffic control systems, Marlin enables multiple stakeholders to share and visualize vessel route plans, foresee and avoid conflicts between vessels and fixed assets, optimize schedules safely within a rules-based environment, and measure and improve asset performance.
Our Devices group develops intelligent equipment controlled by our software to optimize operations. Our Devices group develops, manufactures and repairs marine towed streamer and seabed data acquisition systems, sensors and compasses which have been deployed in marine robotics, defense, scientific, E&P and other commercial applications. 
Marine Positioning Systems - Our marine towed streamer positioning system includes streamer cable depth control devices, lateral control devices, compasses, acoustic positioning systems and other auxiliary sensors. This equipment is designed to control the vertical and horizontal positioning of the streamer cables and provides acoustic, compass and depth measurements to allow processors to tie navigation and location data to geophysical data to determine the location of potential hydrocarbon reserves. 
Towed Streamer Data Acquisition System - DigiSTREAMER enables customers to acquire low noise, cost-effective data in an environmentally-friendly manner with solid cables.
Ocean Bottom Data Acquisition Technologies - Ocean bottom data acquisition provides higher resolution imaging typically used for development rather than exploration objectives because it provides more detailed reservoir characteristics to optimize production. ION’s 4Sea ocean bottom system is designed to deliver a step change in economics, image quality, QHSE and final data delivery time, creating more value for the customers by providing information faster for critical decisions, such as determining drilling locations, fluid injections, etc. The system’s transformational architecture enables a paradigm shift in performance by centralizing operational data to power analytics and optimize decision-making. While the technology components can be licensed separately, maximum value is derived from a complete system. The Company is offering 4Sea components more broadly to the growing number of OBS service providers under recurring revenue commercial strategies.
Marine Diverter - SailWing is an innovative foil-based marine diverter for smart and efficient source towing. SailWing consists of a series of foils over ropes strung between the head float and the first source station. The foil sizes and number are easily configurable to accommodate a wide variety of survey requirements.
Analog Geophones - Analog geophones are sensors that measure acoustic energy reflected from rock layers in the Earth’s subsurface using a mechanical, coil-spring element. We manufacture and market a full suite of geophones and geophone test equipment that operate in most environments, including land surface, transition zone and downhole. Our geophones are used in other industries as well.
INOVA Geophysical. INOVA manufactures land acquisition systems, including the G3i HD, Hawk and Quantum recording platforms, land source products, including the AHV-IV series, UNIVIB®, and UNIVIB 2 vibroseis vehicles, and source controllers and multicomponent sensors, including the VectorSeis digital 3C receivers.
ION History
Founded in 1968 as Input/Output (“I/O”), ION began as a provider of highly specialized seismic source synchronization equipment. In 1988, the company introduced its first land system, System One, capable of recording large volumes of data more quickly, which helped the industry shift from 2D to 3D data. ION became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange in 1991, and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994 using the trading symbol "IO". Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, ION experienced growth through a number of acquisitions. In 2002, the company’s first BasinSPAN multi-client program was introduced, paving the way for a global data library. In September 2007, Input/Output officially changed its name to "ION" as part of a re-branding to better reflect the continuing evolution of the company from an equipment manufacturer to a broad-based, technology-focused seismic solutions provider.

E&P Subsurface Data Collection and Use
Since the 1930s, oil and gas companies have sought to reduce exploration risk by using seismic data to create an image of the Earth’s subsurface. Seismic imaging plays a fundamental role in hydrocarbon exploration and reservoir development by delineating structures, rock types and fluid locations in the subsurface. Our technologies, services and solutions are used by E&P companies to generate high-resolution images of the Earth’s subsurface to identify hydrocarbons and pinpoint drilling locations for wells and to monitor production from existing wells.
Typically, an E&P company engages the services of a geophysical acquisition contractor to develop a seismic survey design, secure permits, coordinate logistics, and acquire seismic data in a selected area. The E&P company generally relies on third parties, such as ION, to provide the contractor with equipment, navigation and data management software, and field support services necessary for data acquisition. After the data is collected, the same geophysical contractor, a third-party data processing company, or the E&P company itself will process the data using proprietary algorithms and workflows to create a series of seismic images. Geoscientists then interpret the data by reviewing the images of the subsurface and integrating the geophysical data with other geological and production information such as well logs or core information.
Seismic data is recorded when listening devices placed on the Earth’s surface, ocean bottom floor, or carried within the streamer cable of a towed streamer vessel, measure how long it takes for sound vibrations to echo off rock layers underground. For seismic data acquisition onshore, the acoustic energy producing the sound vibrations is generated by large vibroseis (vibrator) vehicles. In marine acquisition, the energy is provided by a series of source arrays that deliver compressed air into the water column. The acoustic energy propagates through the subsurface as a spherical wave front, or seismic wave. Interfaces between different types of rocks will both reflect and transmit this wave front. Onshore, the reflected signals return to the surface where they are measured by sensitive receivers that are analog coil-spring geophones. Offshore, the reflected signals are recorded by either hydrophones towed in an array behind a streamer acquisition vessel or by multicomponent geophones or micro electromechanical system sensors that are placed directly on the ocean floor. Once the recorded seismic energy is processed using advanced algorithms and workflows, images of the subsurface can be created to depict the structure, lithology (rock type), fracture patterns, and fluid content of subsurface horizons, highlighting the most promising places to drill for oil and natural gas. This processing also aids in engineering decisions, such as drilling and completion methods, as well as decisions affecting overall reservoir production and economic decisions relating to infrastructure and reserves in place.
Markets and Customers
Our core E&P market is in recovery and we are diversifying our revenues in other markets to help mitigate the impact of oil and gas market cycles. Our primary customers are E&P companies to whom we market and offer services, primarily multi-client seismic data programs from our Ventures group, data processing and imaging services from our Imaging Services group, as well as consulting services from our E&P Advisors and Optimization Software & Services group. In 2019, E&P companies accounted for approximately 73% of our total consolidated net revenues. Secondarily, seismic contractors purchase our towed streamer data acquisition systems and related equipment and software to collect data in accordance with their E&P company customers’ specifications or for their own seismic data libraries.
We are actively diversifying our software and hardware into adjacent markets, primarily focused on ports and harbors and defense industries. Ports and harbors are undergoing a digital transformation that is fundamentally changing how they operate and increasing efficiency. Tier 1 ports have been leading the digital transformation, and there's an emerging need for Tier 2 ports to do so as well to compete. New disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and Blockchain have the potential to transform port efficiency.
The defense industry also benefits from enhanced situational awareness and advanced technologies for mission management and threat detection and mitigation. Using Marlin as the mission control and decision optimization tool in defense exercises, we were able to track hostile divers and unmanned underwater vehicles and manage real-time mitigation actions in response to operation zone incursions, such as smart nets, remote operated vehicle (“ROV”) interception and shepherding of friendly assets via unmanned service vehicles. 
A significant portion of our marketing effort is focused on areas outside of the United States. Foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of political instability, armed conflict, civil disturbances, currency fluctuations, embargo and governmental activities, customer credit risks and risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, including tariff regulations and import/export restrictions.

We sell our services and products through a direct sales force consisting of employees and international third-party sales representatives responsible for key geographic areas. The majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales to destinations outside of North America accounted for approximately 73%, 75% and 76% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Further, systems and equipment sold to domestic customers are frequently deployed internationally and, from time to time, certain foreign sales require export licenses.
Traditionally, our business has been seasonal, with strongest demand typically in the second half of our fiscal year.
For information concerning the geographic breakdown of our consolidated net revenues, see Footnote 3 “Segment and Geographic Information of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Competition
The market for seismic services and products is highly competitive and characterized by frequent changes in technology. 
Our Ventures group within our E&P Technology & Services segment faces competition in creating, developing and selling multi-client data libraries from a number of companies. CGG (an integrated geophysical company) and Schlumberger (a large integrated oilfield services company) shifted to an asset light strategy, joining TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA. Petroleum GeoServices ASA, Shearwater and Polarcus run acquisition crews and also compete in multi-client data acquisition. BGP operates in this space by primarily partnering with the aforementioned competitors to develop and sell multi-client data.
Our Imaging Services group within our E&P Technology & Services segment competes with companies that provide data processing services to E&P companies. See “Services and Products - E&P Technology & Services Segment.” While the barriers to enter this market are relatively low, we believe the barriers to compete at the higher end of the market where our efforts are focused - are significantly higher. At the higher end of this market, CGG and Schlumberger are our two primary competitors for advanced imaging services. Both of these companies are significantly larger than ION in terms of revenue, processing locations and sales, marketing and financial resources.
Our principal competitor for marine equipment is Sercel (a manufacturing subsidiary of CGG). Sercel has the advantage of being able to sell its products and services to its parent company that operates both land and marine crews, providing it with a significant and stable internal market and a greater ability to test new technology in the field. We also compete with other equipment companies on a product-by-product basis. Our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic instruments and data acquisition systems depends principally upon continued technological innovation, as well as pricing, system reliability, reputation for quality and ability to deliver on schedule.
Some service providers design and manufacture acquisition technology in-house (or through a network of third-party vendors) to differentiate themselves. Although this technology competes directly with ours, it is not usually made available to other seismic acquisition contractors. 
In the land seismic equipment market, where INOVA competes, the principal competitors are Sercel and Geospace Technologies. INOVA is a joint venture with BGP as a majority stake owner. BGP purchases land seismic equipment from both INOVA and competing land equipment suppliers.
Outside of our core market, we compete with a number of software and hardware technology companies. The market for ports and harbors and defense technologies tends to be very fragmented and with a range of huge multi-billion dollar competitors to new startups. The closest competitor to Marlin in ports and harbors is PortMaster, software developed by the Port of Rotterdam.
Our Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are to:

• | Leverage our technologies to create value through data capture, analysis and optimization to enhance companies’ critical decision-making abilities and returns. Data, analytics and digitalization provide a step-change opportunity to translate information into insights to enhance decisions, gain a competitive edge and deliver superior returns. As a result, decision-making is shifting from what was historically an art to a science. ION offerings are focused on improving E&P decision-making and optimizing offshore operations.

• | Expand our E&P Technology & Services business, focusing on delivering value closer to the reservoir. Over the last 5 years, we have made an effort to diversify our offerings within the E&P life cycle and move closer to the reservoir. Historically known for our 2D programs, we entered the 3D multi-client market in 2014 by acquiring and processing our first survey offshore Ireland. Since then, we have expanded our 3D seismic data library considerably by purchasing existing seismic data and reimaging the data using our advanced data processing techniques and algorithms, such as our new Full Waveform Inversion (“FWI”). For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue investing in research and development and computing infrastructure for our data processing business and to support our multi-client projects. We believe shifting to more reservoir-focused E&P offerings will increase earnings and position our company better for E&P cycles. 


• | Expand our Operations Optimization business into relevant adjacent markets. While our traditional focus for technology has been on the E&P industry, we are broadening and diversifying our software and equipment businesses into relevant adjacent markets such as offshore logistics, defense and marine robotics. Adjacent markets broaden our opportunity to better monetize our return on technology investments while reducing our susceptibility to E&P cycles. We intend to derive a significant portion of revenues from these non-E&P markets over the next 5 years. 


• | Continue investing in advanced software and equipment technology to provide next generation services and products. Our industry is competitive and continually evolving, so we intend to continue investing in the development of new technologies to stay on the cutting-edge of innovation. A key element of our business strategy has been to understand the challenges faced in survey planning, data acquisition, processing, and interpretation and offshore operations. We will continue to develop and offer technology and services that enable us to work with clients to solve their unique challenges around the world. In particular, we intend to focus on the development of our 4Sea next generation ocean bottom seismic (“OBS”) technology, our Marlin operations optimization software, and continued advancement of our data processing and imaging workflows, such as FWI, with the goal of obtaining technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe are important and expanding markets. In 2019, our total investment in research and development and engineering was equal to approximately 11% of our total consolidated net revenues for the year. 

Our Strengths
We believe that we are solidly positioned to successfully execute the key elements of our business strategy based on the following competitive strengths:

• | We develop and leverage cutting-edge technology platforms to improve decision-making and profitability. Our cutting-edge data management and analysis platforms help derive insights from data we acquire to improve E&P decision-making, enhance reservoir management and optimize offshore operations. The data can be used to decide whether and how much to bid on a block, how to maximize production from a field, or how to optimize the safety and efficiency of complex maritime projects. Our operations optimization platform and imaging engine are the core underlying technology and we continually advance our complex algorithms to improve the resulting analysis. 


• | We focus on higher potential return offerings and creative business models to maximize shareholder value. We streamlined our business and focused on the areas with the highest potential returns because we believe every dollar invested should go further. In addition, we try to structure both the project financing and payment in a way to maximize profit, such as sharing in the success of a project. 


• | Our “asset light” strategy enables us to avoid significant fixed costs and remain financially flexible. We do not own a fleet of marine vessels and do not provide our own crews to acquire seismic data. We outsource seismic data acquisition activity to third parties that operate fleets of seismic vessels and equipment. This practice enables us to avoid fixed costs associated with these assets and personnel and to manage our business in a manner designed to afford us the flexibility to quickly scale up or down our capital investments based on E&P spending levels. We actively manage the costs of developing our multi-client data library business by having our customers partially pre-fund, or underwrite, the investment for any new project. Our target goal is to have a vast majority of the total cost of each new project’s data acquisition to be underwritten by our customers. We believe this conservative approach to data library investment is the most prudent way to reduce the impact of any sudden reduction in the demand for seismic data, giving us the flexibility to aggressively reduce cash outflows as we have successfully implemented in the current industry downturn.

• | Our global footprint and diversified portfolio approach enable us to offset regional downturns or local slowdowns. Conducting business around the world has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategy. This global focus and diversified portfolio approach has been helpful in minimizing the impact of any regional or country-specific slowdown for short or extended periods of time. While the traditional focus of our cutting-edge technology has been on the E&P industry, we are now broadening and diversifying our business into relevant adjacent markets such as offshore logistics, defense and marine robotics. Adjacent markets broaden our opportunity to better monetize our return on technology investments while reducing our susceptibility to E&P cycles. 


• | We have a diversified and blue chip customer base. We provide services and products to a diverse, global customer base that includes many of the largest oil and gas and geophysical companies in the world, including National Oil Companies (“NOCs”) and International Oil Companies (“IOCs”). Whereas almost all of our revenues in the early 2000s were derived principally from seismic service providers, in 2019, E&P companies accounted for approximately 73% of our total consolidated net revenues.

Product Research and Development
Our ability to compete effectively depends principally upon continued innovation in our underlying technologies and the value we can provide to inform decisions. As such, the overall focus of our research and development efforts has remained on improving the quality and value of the data we provide and the subsurface images we generate. In particular, we have concentrated on enhancing the quality of the information that can be extracted from the subsurface images. Research and development efforts targeted a range of new technologies.
The Imaging Services group continued to enhance its high-end workflows, such as FWI, and invest in infrastructure to efficiently deliver Tier 1 image quality.
The Optimization Software & Services group continues enhancing core survey design and command and control software while broadening Marlin’s capabilities for adjacent markets, primarily for ports and harbors.
In 2019, development within Devices group was focused on the new in-water control device, SailWing, including sea trials and integration with Orca and Gator software, as well as further development of our successful towed streamer positioning products, including the automated Streamer Recovery Device and rechargeable battery option. We continue to invest in the development of new sensors applicable within and outside our core business. In 2020, development will be primarily focused on new technologies for adjacent markets and sustaining our existing portfolio of technologies.
As many of these new services and products are under development and, as the development cycles from initial conception to commercial introduction can extend over a number of years, their commercial feasibility or degree of commercial acceptance may not yet be established. No assurance can be given concerning the successful development of any new service or product, any enhancements to them, the specific timing of their release or their level of acceptance in the marketplace.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies. We have approximately 600 patents and pending patent applications, including filings in international jurisdictions with respect to the same kinds of technologies. Although our portfolio of patents is considered important to our operations, and particular patents may be material to specific business lines, no one patent is considered essential to our consolidated business operations.
Our patents, copyrights and trademarks offer us only limited protection. Our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, or may design around the proprietary features of our products. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult, and we may be unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs. Our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the United States, including the potential for adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries with unpredictable or corrupt judicial systems. From time to time, third parties inquire and claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we make similar inquiries and claims to third parties. Material intellectual property litigation is discussed in detail in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”

Regulatory Matters
Our operations are subject to various international conventions, laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the importation of and operation of seismic equipment, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, environmental protection, the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of equipment. Our operations are subject to government policies and product certification requirements worldwide. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating the companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and gas companies and may continue to do so. Operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings (including the potential for adverse decisions by judicial or administrative bodies in foreign countries with unpredictable or corrupt judicial systems). We are required to consent to home country jurisdiction in many of our contracts with foreign state-owned companies, particularly those countries where our data are acquired. 
Changes in these conventions, regulations, policies or requirements could affect the demand for our services and products or result in the need to modify them, which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. Our export activities are subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations. Certain countries are subject to trade restrictions, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. These restrictions and sanctions prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries.
Our operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. While the industry has experienced an increase in general environmental regulation worldwide and laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent, we do not believe compliance with these regulations has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations, and we do not currently foresee the need for significant expenditures in order to be able to remain compliant in all material respects with current environmental protection laws. Regulations in this area are subject to change, and there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Our customers’ operations are also significantly impacted in other respects by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species. To the extent that our customers’ operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 519 regular, full-time employees, 295 of whom were located in the U.S. From time to time and on an as-needed basis, we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or retain as independent contractors in order to meet certain internal manufacturing or other business needs. Our U.S. employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
