ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Alarm.com is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. We offer a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions for smart residential and commercial properties, including interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, energy management and wellness solutions. Millions of property owners depend on our technology to intelligently secure, automate and manage their residential and commercial properties. In the last year alone, our platforms processed more than 200 billion data points generated by over 100 million connected devices. We believe that this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.
Our solutions are delivered through an established network of over 10,000 trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions. We primarily generate Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. We also generate hardware and other revenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video cameras, video recorders, gateway modules and smart thermostats. 
We enter into contracts with our service provider partners that establish pricing for access to our platform solutions and for the sale of hardware. These service provider contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year. Our service provider partners typically enter into contracts with our subscribers, which our service provider partners have indicated range from three to five years in length. Our service provider partners are free to market and sell our products under their own guidelines at prices to the consumer that they establish independently. We believe that our network of service providers and the length of our service relationships with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust SaaS platforms and over 20 years of operating experience, contribute to a compelling business model.
We have experienced significant growth since our company's inception in 2000. We generated total revenue of $618.0 million, $502.4 million and $420.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our SaaS and license revenue was $393.3 million, $337.4 million and $291.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a compound annual growth rate of 16.2%. We also generated net income attributable to common stockholders of $77.9 million, $53.5 million and $21.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as well as Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, of $125.3 million, $108.3 million and $93.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See the Non-GAAP Measures section of Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Measures," for a discussion of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Our Solutions and Integrated Platforms
Our solutions are designed to make both residential and commercial properties safer, smarter and more efficient.

Our image sensor, designed by our device engineering team and manufactured in the United States by a contract manufacturing partner, is a wireless, battery-operated, passive infrared motion sensor that captures images based on various system triggers. These images are transmitted by our cellular communications module to our cloud platforms. Subscribers can securely view images through our website and mobile apps, as well as customize their notification settings to have new images automatically sent via SMS and email.
◦Video Cameras. We offer a suite of high definition, Internet Protocol, or IP, video cameras to enable our video monitoring services. Our indoor, outdoor, and video doorbell cameras include options for night vision capabilities as well as wireless or Power over Ethernet communication features. We also offer a network video recording device, the SVR, for on premise, continuous video recording seamlessly connected to our cloud platforms for remote playback through our user interfaces. Our video cameras and SVRs are specified to our platforms through proprietary software. 
◦Alarm.com Smart Thermostat. Our Smart Thermostat combines elegant design, sophisticated cloud services and advanced energy management features. It was designed by our Building 36 and device engineering teams to work in concert with other devices in the connected property. It communicates with the Alarm.com communications module via Z-wave and supports both battery power and common wire power installation.
•Remote temperature sensors can pair with our Smart Thermostat to enable temperature set points for any room in the property, not just the room where the thermostat is installed. Our Smart Thermostat supports multiple remote temperature sensors for precise temperature control for a residential or commercial property.
•We designed our Smart Thermostat to be easy to install and support remotely. The MobileTech app assists in proper wiring and installation and Remote Toolkit enables remote access to the thermostat settings for easy troubleshooting and support.
◦Smart Water Valve + Meter. Our Smart Water Valve + Meter is an innovative addition to the Alarm.com Water Management solution, identifying low and high-volume water leaks and constantly monitoring overall water use and current usage rates in homes and businesses. Deep integration with the Alarm.com platform leverages intelligence and insights to help reduce the risk of losses from water emergencies, while also improving water conservation efforts.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platforms and applications, support our technology infrastructure, develop new capabilities and conduct quality assurance testing. We expect to invest significantly in continued research and development efforts to expand the capabilities of our technology. Our research and development of new products and services is a multidisciplinary effort across our product management, program management, software engineering, device engineering, quality engineering, configuration management and network operations teams. 
Service Provider Network
Our trusted service provider partner network is key in driving the adoption of connected home and commercial solutions. Our solutions are sold, installed, and serviced by a network of independent licensed, professional service provider partners. Our channel network currently consists of over 10,000 active service provider partners, including smaller local providers, larger regional providers and national service providers with thousands of employees. We have also seen growth in other areas of our channel network, including new providers in the intelligent automation, HVAC, property management and insurance markets.
We believe this highly trusted, established network is a core strength that enables an efficient and scalable customer acquisition model, allowing us to focus on technology innovation. We also believe that the combination of our solutions and our service provider partners’ expertise is the most effective way to drive mass market adoption of the intelligently connected property.
The traditional security and home automation market is highly fragmented with approximately 15,000 security service providers nationally. According to the February 2020 Barnes Buchanan Conference Report, the top 5 dealers represented approximately 34% of all industry recurring monthly revenue in 2020. The distribution of revenue among our service provider partners is reflective of the industry overall. ADT LLC represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
Subscribers
Our platforms currently support millions of residential and commercial subscribers. We define the number of subscribers as the number of residential or commercial properties to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. A subscriber who subscribes to one of our service level packages as well as one or more of our a la carte add-ons is counted as one subscriber. Our number of subscribers does not include the customers of our service provider partners to whom we license our intellectual property, as they do not utilize one of our SaaS platforms. Our subscriber acquisition cost payback period has historically been one year or less.
Sales and Marketing
The goal of our sales team is to help our service provider partners succeed in selling, installing and supporting our full suite of solutions. Our sales team is also responsible for recruiting new service provider partners to Alarm.com. We also have a global business development team dedicated to establishing new service provider and distribution relationships in international markets.
Our marketing team is focused on empowering our service provider partners to effectively promote and sell our solutions. We design, develop and provide end-to-end marketing services including tools and content for lifecycle marketing to help our service providers build awareness, create interest, activate subscribers, develop and maintain the ongoing customer relationship, increase customer engagement, and generate upsell and referral opportunities. While we offer tools and services to assist our service providers when they are marketing to potential subscribers, we do not control or influence the marketing activities performed by our service providers, as they are free to select the marketing tools they believe will be the most effective. Our contracts with our service providers require that they comply with all applicable rules and laws when engaging in marketing activities. We also offer comprehensive training opportunities through our Alarm.com Academy, including in-person training courses and an online learning management system.
We believe our sales and marketing approach enables us to expand our breadth of service providers, provide highly customized services and scale quickly.
Service Provider Support
We support the full suite of software and hardware products on the Alarm.com platform through a highly trained and experienced team of professionals based in the United States. We primarily support our service provider partners. Our service provider partners, in turn, support their customers, who are our subscribers. To that end, subscribers occasionally reach us directly with support needs and we either assist the subscriber directly or, when appropriate, route the subscriber to the appropriate service provider partner for additional assistance.
We offer high-quality support to our service providers via phone, web ticketing and email. With every interaction, our team is committed to exceptional customer satisfaction and industry-leading response times. We use a tiered structure to efficiently escalate and resolve issues of varying complexity and to scale our support organization as we grow. Our staff is multilingual and we continue to grow our language capabilities to support our international expansion.
Our Competition
The market in which we participate for connected property solutions is fragmented, highly competitive and constantly evolving. We expect competition to continue from existing competitors as well as potential new market entrants in the interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation and energy management markets. Our current competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected property with interactive security, including Alula (formed following the merger of ipDatatel, LLC and Resolution Products, LLC), Avigilon Corporation, Brivo Inc., Digital Monitoring Products Inc., Eagle Eye Networks Inc., Honeywell International Inc., Resideo Technologies Inc., SecureNet Technologies, LLC, Telular Corporation (acquired by AMETEK, Inc.), United Technologies Corporation, and Verkada Inc., which sell solutions to service providers, cable operators, technology retailers and other residential and commercial automation providers. We also compete with interactive, monitored security solutions sold directly to subscribers and may also be sold through our partners, including companies like Abode Systems, Inc., Arlo Technologies, Inc., Cove Smart, LLC, Scout Security, Inc. and SimpliSafe, Inc. In addition, our service provider partners compete with security solutions sold directly to subscribers, as well as managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and broadband companies like AT&T Inc., Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and Rogers Communications, Inc., and providers of point products, including Google Inc.'s Nest Labs, Inc. Amazon.com offers Amazon Home Services security packages with bundled equipment and professional installation, and Amazon Key, a security camera and smart lock integration feature. Ring Inc., owned by Amazon.com, offers a connected video doorbell, video cameras and an integrated security system, Ring Alarm. Samsung's SmartThings offers a security system and a home automation and awareness hub. Arlo Technologies, Inc. and Wyze Labs, Inc. offers connected video cameras, a connected video doorbell, and smart security devices. Apple Inc. offers a feature that allows some manufacturers’ connected devices and accessories, including video cameras and doorbells, to be controlled through its HomeKit service available in Apple’s iOS operating system. Additionally, Canary and other companies offer all in one video monitoring and awareness devices. In addition, we may compete 
with other large and small technology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the broader connected home market.
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased competition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and automation, wellness, and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. In addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that reduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of which could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business. We believe the principal competitive factors in the connected property market include the following:
•simplicity and ease of use;
•ability to offer persistent awareness, control, and intelligent automation;
•breadth of features and functionality provided;
•flexibility of the solutions and ability to personalize for the individual consumer;
•compatibility with a wide selection of third-party devices;
•pricing, affordability, and accessibility;
•sales reach and local installation and support capabilities; and
•brand awareness and reputation.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. Additionally, we believe that our cloud-based software platforms, intelligently connected property solutions, and proven scalability help further differentiate us from competitors. Nevertheless, our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and broader distribution channels than we do.
Our Intellectual Property
Our success and ability to compete effectively depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality agreements and other contractual protections.
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 423 issued United States utility patents, one issued United States design patent, eight issued Canadian patents and five issued Australian patents and these patents are scheduled to expire between 2021 and 2039. We continue to broaden our intellectual property portfolio and file patent applications and as of December 31, 2020, we had 261 pending utility patent applications and 44 provisional patent applications filed in the United States. We also had 13 pending international patent applications and 106 international patent applications pending under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. The claims for which we have sought patent protection apply to both our platforms and solutions. Our patent and patent applications generally apply to the features and functions of our platforms, and solutions and the applications associated with our platforms. We also have, and may be required to seek, licenses under patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software.
We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. We have 15 registered trademarks in the United States, including Alarm.com and the Alarm.com logo and design, and six registered trademarks in Canada.
We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development to enter into agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, concepts, processes, improvements and other works generated by them on our behalf are our intellectual property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim in those works.
We expect that products in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement lawsuits as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. We have brought infringement claims against third parties in the past and may do so in the future to defend our intellectual property position. In addition, from time to time, we 
may face claims by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or to have misappropriated such rights. In the future, we, or our service providers or subscribers, may be the subject of legal proceedings alleging that our solutions or underlying technology infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of others.
Our Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,404 full-time employees, including 461 in sales and marketing, 780 in research and development and 163 in a general and administrative capacity. As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,290 employees in our Alarm.com segment and 114 employees in our Other segment. We also engage consultants and temporary employees from time to time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is critical to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our service provider partners and protect the long-term interests of our stockholders. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives and offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices.
To further engage and incentivize our workforce, we offer a wide range of programs and avenues for support, motivation, and professional recognition. We utilize both instructor-led training and online learning to provide custom training courses to ensure our sales and services teams stay up-to-date on our products and service offerings. For our talent pipeline development, we work closely with individual departments to provide training and hands-on support for managers and leaders, to assess talent, identify development opportunities and discuss succession planning. In addition, we regularly conduct employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
Government Regulations
Our business, operations and service provider partners are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local consumer protection laws, licensing regulation and other laws and regulations, and to similar laws and regulations in the other countries in which we operate. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.

In March of 2020, we acquired certain additional assets from two separate unrelated parties. Substantially all of the assets acquired in September 2019 and March 2020 consisted of in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We believe the acquisitions of the IPR&D will further our commitment to make significant investments in innovative research and development in the intelligently connected property market to broaden our suite of solutions as well as strengthen our smart intercom capability. On December 14, 2020, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding ownership interest units of Shooter Detection Systems, LLC , or SDS.
