Overview of key events of the year ended September 30, 2022
 
During 2021-22, we continued to work on obtaining funding in order to start clinical trials and gain FDA product approval for our product, NovaDerm®. Having secured an Orphan Drug Designation as a biologic for this product, we continued to comply with the FDA annual reporting requirements.
 
To avoid the introduction of pathogens when using materials from animals to produce drugs, devices, and biologics, NovaDerm® and future Regenicin products all use tracible and pure animal sourced materials. We have worked with the FDA to ensure we are meeting federal expectations in this regard during the production process.
 
We estimate that the completion of the IND and the clinical trials will take at least 18 months and cost in excess of $7 million. In addition to the completion of the IND, the only other significant gating item to enter clinical trials has been finding funding for this process.
 
Subsequent to the end of this fiscal year, we began selling materials and rights to our NovaDerm® product to individuals through a new Nevada series LLC we set up, NovaDerm Product Package LLC, as more fully described in the next section entitled ‘Our Business Moving Forward In 2023’. These rights and material sales generated a substantial amount of funding which we believe will provide us enough capital to complete the NovaDerm IND and allow us to proceed with the Clinical Trials of our NovaDerm® product. No assurance can be given, however, as to the results of such Clinical Trials, any future FDA approval, or our ability to complete and offer our NovaDerm® product commercially in the future.
 
Three board positions remain open on our Board of Directors.
 
Importantly, we are filing this annual report without our auditor’s review or any audit of our financial information or this report. Our reason for doing this is that we are still negotiating with our potential auditors for the completion of an audit and review of our unaudited past years reports prior to obtaining an audit of this current 10K filing. Instead, we have provided herein information as typically presented in our 10K annual report, including financial information, which has not been reviewed or audited by any independent outside source.
 
We intend, if and when able, to file an amendment to this 10K filing with such audited information. We are unaware at this time when we will obtain the necessary audit of the current and past filings; however, we will continue to provide current information to investors and the public when we are able through either our EDGAR filings and/or through postings on our website.
 
Our Business Moving Forward In 2023 
 
Subsequent to the end of this fiscal year, in October 2022, we set up a new Nevada Series LLC called NovaDerm Product Package, LLC (“NPP LLC”). During November and December 2022, consistent with Nevada law governing this Master Series LLC, we then establish twenty-five (25) individual series LLCs, identifying each with a series letter of A through T or AA through EE. Thus, each of these sub-entities were named NovaDerm Product Package Series A, LLC through Series T, LLC, and then Series AA to Series EE, LLC (or NPP-A through NPP-T and NPP-AA through NPP-EE for short).
 
Into each of these twenty-five individual Series LLCs, we contributed the right and exclusive ownership to a certain amount of the bovine hides and corium we currently own and use as key materials in the preparation of our NovaDerm® product, as well as the right to designate: (a) the specific patient cultured skin to be prepared from these materials; (b) the amount of this cultured skin to be prepared up to a designated amount and (c) the medical facility to receive the fully prepared and processed NovaDerm® cultured skin from these materials (these materials and combined designation rights are collectively referred to herein as the “NovaDerm® Product Rights”). For NPP-A through NPP-T and NPP-AA through NPP-CC we designated 33,333 cm2 of these NovaDerm® Product Rights. For NPP-DD we designated 30,625 cm2 of NovaDerm® Product Rights and for NPP-EE we designated 28,783 cm2 of NovaDerm® Product Rights. Each contribution of each of the NovaDerm® Product Rights was provided in exchange for 100 membership interests in the Series LLC which represented 100% of all membership interests issued.
 
We subsequently transferred 99% of our membership interests (or 99 membership interests) in each of these Series LLC to various Limited Liability Companies, held by individuals unknown to us, in exchange for a pre-agreed payment.
 
While we retain possession of the materials transferred in each Series LLC contribution, we have a continuing obligation to segregated and manage those materials as well as to prepare the NovaDerm® cultured skin product as designated by each Series LLC holder or their designate. The identified materials are currently set apart from other such materials and are being held by us pending the identification of the patient and medical facility as instructed by each NovaDerm® Product Rights holder. Notwithstanding this retention of possession by us, the ownership and legal title to the materials are retained and fully vested in the individual Series LLC or its designate.

The above-described transfers of membership interests in the Series LLCs generated a substantial amount of cash which we are obligated to use for the completion of our NovaDerm IND and the administration of our product clinical trials. No assurance, however, can be given as to the success or failure of such IND or clinical trials, or as to any future FDA decisions made following these trials.
 
Our major objective for 2023 remains to complete the requirements of our NovaDerm IND application and begin our clinical trials. It is estimated that the cost to finalize the IND will be approximately $1.9 million dollars, and the cost to complete Phase 1/2 of the clinical trial will be approximately 5.0 million dollars. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete these tasks for these estimated amounts or that we will be successful in the proving out our NovaDerm® Product in this process. Indeed, clinic trials are notoriously difficult and expensive and are likely to result in additional unplanned costs and a denial of FDA approval.
 
As previously reported, our goal in obtaining funding for this process has been to minimize shareholders' dilution as much as possible. We believe the manner in which we structured our sales of NovaDerm® Product Rights has successfully achieved this objective. We will continue to work with potential investors in order to pursue other necessary funding based on our stated objective of successfully completing our planned clinical trials and obtaining FDA approval for the commercial sale of our NovaDerm® Product. It has taken longer to raise the funds than originally estimated; however, we remain hopeful that our goal is now achievable.
 
In the preparation of the IND application, we will continue to develop the testing suggested by the FDA during our Pre-IND meeting. Our scaffold supplier continues to perform the FDA suggested testing on collagen processing which addresses Bovine Closed Herd requirements for the enhanced safety and traceability of the collagen scaffolds used to produce NovaDerm®. We will be entering into discussions and evaluation of possible clinical trial sites for NovaDerm® as we proceed through the FDA approval process. Our discussions so far have confirmed that patient recruitment and enrollment should be faster and less complicated than other clinical trials because of our Orphan Designation and the fact that the surgical protocol will be similar to the grafting procedures currently in use at most facilities. NovaDerm® should thus require minimal physician training and documentation to complete the clinical trial, when and if conducted.
 
We are in the process of preparing a detailed plan and timeline for the filing of our IND and commencement of clinical trials and will provide this information when complete and approved by our board of directors. Our initial trials are planned to begin with a total of ten subjects and an Initial Data Safety Monitoring Board, (DSMB), review of safety on the first three subjects once they have reached 6 months follow-up. We do not intend to interrupt our trial waiting for the DSMB report. Our management’s approach is to set up the trials so as to allow for a seamless transition into commercial production upon approval. We have arranged for sufficient Bovine Closed Herd corium to produce sufficient collagen scaffolds to meet our needs for the clinical trials once the IND is approved.
 
Our First Product Candidate NovaDerm®
 
Our first cultured skin substitute product candidate, NovaDerm®, is a multi-layered tissue-engineered living skin prepared by utilizing autologous (patient’s own) skin cells. It is a graftable cultured epithelium skin substitute containing both epidermal and dermal components with a collagen base. Clinically, we expect our Cultured Skin substitute self-to-self skin graft product will perform the same as split thickness allograft skin. Our Autologous cultured skin substitute should not be rejected by the immune system of the patient, unlike porcine or cadaver cellular grafts. Immune system rejection is a serious concern in Xeno-transplant procedures which have a cellular component. The use of our cultured skin substitute should not require any specialized physician training because it is applied the same as in a standard split thickness allograft procedure.
 
NovaDerm® does not require the large harvest areas that are required when performing split thickness allograft procedures. NovaDerm® is designed to need only a small area of harvest material to cover the wound. This is a marked improvement over split thickness allograft skin which can be stretched only 2 to 4 times its original coverage area. This results in limitations on how much burned area can be covered with this procedure. When a patient has more than 50% of their body with full thickness burns, there is simply not enough harvest area available to cover the burned area. As a result, the same area harvested must be allowed to grow back to get enough replacement skin, allowing for a high risk of infection and even mortality. NovaDerm® is expected to expand 100 to 400 times in coverage, greatly reducing this problem as well as scarring caused by harvesting.
 
Clinically speaking, a product designed to treat a life-threatening condition must be available for the patient when needed. Our Culture skin substitute is being developed to be ready to apply to the patient within the first month of admission to the hospital, when the patient is ready for grafting. Patients with serious burn injuries may not be in a condition to be grafted on a predefined schedule made more than a month in advance. Therefore, in order to accommodate the patient’s needs, we are striving to ensure that our cultured skin substitute will have an adequate shelf life and manufacturing schedule to ensure it is available whether the patient needs it the first month, or any day after, until the patient’s wound is completely covered and closed. We intend to provide a patient with enough NovaDerm® to meet the patients’ needs in a single lot of material with adequate shelf life to be available when the patient is ready. With an extended shelf life and enough material in the first shipment, a physician may perform a second grafting 5 to 10 days post the first grafting period.
 
At this time, we first plan to seek FDA approval for burns as an Orphan Biologic Product to establish significant safety data and then seek Biological License Approval.
 
Our second product is anticipated to be TempaDerm® . TempaDerm® uses cells obtained from human donors to develop banks of cryo-preserved (frozen) cells and cultured skin substitutes to provide a continuous supply of non-allogenic skin substitutes to treat much smaller wound areas on patients, such as ulcers. This product is expected to have applications in the treatment of chronic skin wounds such as diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers and venous stasis ulcers. This product is expected to be similar to our burn indication product, except for the indications, and it will not depend totally on autologous cells. In fact, it may be possible to use the excess cultured skin that was originally produced for use on the patient that donated the cells to grow the skin. Potentially, TempaDerm® will be able to take this original cultured skin and use it on someone other than the original donor. 
 
As currently planned, TempaDerm® has the possibility of using banked cells, or even frozen cultured skin substitutes, to carry inventory to satisfy unknown needs or large volumes to meet the demands created in large scale disasters. Because of our focus to date on NovaDerm®, we have taken only limited steps toward the development of TempaDerm®. We may also decellularize TempaDerm® or NovaDerm® to make collagen wound coverings containing all the natural growth promoters found in skin.
 
We believe this technology has many different uses beyond the burn indication. The other uses may include chronic wounds, reconstructive surgery, and potentially other complex organs and tissues. Some of the individual components of our planned cultured skin substitute technology is expected to be developed for devices, such as tendon wraps made of collagen or collagen temporary coverings of large area wounds to protect the patients from infections while waiting for a permanent skin substitute. The collagen technology used for cultured skin substitutes, as designed, is expected to be used for many different applications in wound healing and stem cell technology and even drug delivery systems.

Competition
 
Several companies have developed or are developing products that propose to approach the markets described above. There is only one other Autologous Cultured Skin Substitute for severe burns designated as an orphan product candidate, the original Cutanogen’s PermaDerm. This product was licensed by Amarantus to Emerald Organic Products, but, to our knowledge, it has not be approved by the FDA or gone through any clinical trials .
 
In any case, we believe our product is superior in design and function and, thus, provides significant advantages over this competitor. The advantages of our cultured skin substitute include: (a) simultaneous delivery of autologous epidermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts organized with a unique collagen base, (b) it can be produced and ready for patient use in 21 to 28 days, and (c) it has a shelf life of up to 2 weeks once produced.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-85) provides that Orphan Product applications for pediatric use only, or for use in both pediatric and adult patients, that are approved on or after September 27, 2007, are assigned an annual distribution number (ADN) and may be sold for profit (subject to the upper limit of the ADN). In addition, once a product receives an Orphan BLA, the developer of the product receives up to seven years market exclusivity for a specific indication following the product’s approval by the FDA.
 
Unrestricted sales of our cultured skin substitute will not be permitted until we have obtained full FDA approval after data for safety and efficacy are collected from an approved clinical study. Once an IND is submitted, we expect enrollment and treatment to require a full one-year of evaluation on each patient before our product can be fully assessed for human use. The final 3 months of the evaluation is expected to be only a monitoring period. After collection of data from the clinical trial and submission to the FDA, six months is typically planned for the FDA’s review and comments before a decision will be reached on whether or not to approve our product and what limitations on its use may be placed. Because of our Orphan Designation, this review time is expected to be reduced significantly. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
In 2016, we received a registered trademark for NovaDerm®.
