Structure 
 Star Group, L.P. (Star the Company, we, us, or our) is a home heating oil and propane distributor and services provider with one reportable operating segment that principally provides heating related services to residential and commercial customers. At a special meeting of unitholders held on October 25, 2017, our unitholders voted in favor of proposals to have the Company elect to be treated as a corporation, instead of a partnership, for federal income tax purposes (commonly referred to as a check-the-box election), along with amendments to our partnership agreement to effect such changes in income tax classification, in each case effective November 1, 2017. In addition, the Company changed its name, effective October 25, 2017, from Star Gas Partners, L.P. to Star Group, L.P. to more closely align our name with the scope of our product and service offerings. For tax years after December 31, 2017, unitholders will receive a Form 1099-DIV and will not receive a Schedule K-1 as in previous tax years. Our legal structure will remain a Delaware limited partnership and the distribution provisions under our limited partnership agreement, including the incentive distribution structure will remain unchanged. As of November 30, 2017, we had outstanding 55.9 million common partner units (NYSE: SGU) representing a 99.4% limited partner interest in Star, and 0.3 million general partner units, representing a 0.6% general partner interest in Star.

Legal Structure 
 The following chart summarizes our structure as of September 30, 2017. 
 

Business Overview 
 We are a home heating oil and propane distributor and service provider to residential and commercial customers who heat their homes and buildings in the Northeast, Central and Southeast U.S. regions. Our customers are concentrated in the northern and eastern states. As of September 30, 2017, we sold home heating oil and propane to approximately 455,000 full service residential and commercial customers. We believe we are the largest retail distributor of home heating oil in the United States, based upon sales volume with a market share in excess of 5.5%. We also sell home heating oil, gasoline and diesel fuel to approximately 74,000 customers on a delivery only basis. We install, maintain, and repair heating and air conditioning equipment and to a lesser extent provide these services outside our customer base including 15,300 service contracts for natural gas and other heating systems. In addition, we provide home security and plumbing, to approximately 31,000 customers, many of whom are also existing home heating oil and propane customers. During fiscal 2017, total sales were comprised approximately 64.4% from sales of home heating oil and propane; 19.6 % from the installation and repair of heating and air conditioning equipment and ancillary services; and 16.0% from the sale of other petroleum products. We provide home heating equipment repair service and natural gas service 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. These services are an integral part of our business, and are intended to maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
 We conduct our business through an operating subsidiary, Petro Holdings, Inc., utilizing multiple local brand names, such as Petro Home Services, Meenan, and Griffith Energy Services, Inc. 
 We also offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers, including a variable price (market based) option and a price-protected option, the latter of which either sets the maximum price or a fixed price that a customer will pay. Users choose the plan they feel best suits them which we believe increases customer satisfaction. Approximately 96% of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers automatically receive deliveries based on prevailing weather conditions. In addition, approximately 34% of our homeowners take advantage of our smart pay budget payment plan under which their estimated annual oil and propane deliveries and service billings are paid for in a series of equal monthly installments. We use derivative instruments as needed to mitigate our exposure to market risk associated with our price-protected offerings and the storing of our physical home heating oil inventory. Given our size, we are able to realize certain benefits of scale and provide consistent, strong customer service.

Industry Characteristics 
 Home heating oil is primarily used as a source of fuel to heat residences and businesses in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. According to the U.S. Department of EnergyEnergy Information Administration, 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (the latest survey published), these regions account for 80% (4.7 million of 5.9 million) of the households in the United States where heating oil is the main space-heating fuel and 23% (4.7 million of 20.4 million) of the homes in these regions use home heating oil as their main space-heating fuel. Our experience has been that customers have a tendency to increase their conservation efforts as the price of home heating oil increases, thereby reducing their consumption. 
 The retail home heating oil industry is mature, with total market demand expected to decline in the foreseeable future due to conversions to natural gas and other alternative energy sources. Therefore, our ability to maintain our business or grow within the industry is dependent on the acquisition of other retail distributors, the success of our marketing programs, and the growth of our other service offerings. Based on our records, our customer conversions to natural gas have ranged between 1.2% and 2.4% per year over the last five years. We believe this may continue or increase as natural gas has become less expensive than home heating oil on an equivalent BTU basis. In addition, there are legislative and regulatory efforts underway in several states seeking to encourage homeowners to expand the use of natural gas as a heating fuel. 
 The retail home heating oil industry is highly fragmented, characterized by a large number of relatively small, independently owned and operated local distributors. Some dealers provide full service, as we do, and others offer delivery only on a cash-on-delivery basis, which we also do to a significantly lesser extent. In addition, the industry is complex and costly due to regulations, working capital requirements, and the costs and risks of hedging for price protected customers. 
 Propane is a by-product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining. Propane use falls into three broad categories: residential and commercial applications; industrial applications; and agricultural uses. In the residential and commercial markets, propane is used primarily for space heating, water heating, clothes drying and cooking. Industrial customers use propane generally as a motor fuel to power over-the-road vehicles, forklifts and stationary engines, to fire furnaces, as a cutting gas and in other process applications. In the agricultural market, propane is primarily used for tobacco curing, crop drying, poultry breeding and weed control. 
 The retail propane distribution industry is highly competitive, and is generally serviced by large multi-state full-service distributors and small local independent distributors. Like the home heating oil industry, each retail propane distribution provider operates in its own competitive environment because propane distributors typically reside in close proximity to their customers. In most retail propane distribution markets, customers can choose from multiple distributors based on the quality of customer service, safety, reputation and price. 
 It is common practice in our business to price our liquid products to customers based on a per gallon margin over wholesale costs. As a result, we believe distributors such as ourselves generally seek to maintain their per gallon margins by passing wholesale price increases through to customers, thus insulating their margins from the volatility in wholesale prices. However, distributors may be unable or unwilling to pass the entire product cost increases through to customers. In these cases, significant decreases in per gallon margins may result. The timing of cost pass-throughs can also significantly affect margins. (See Customers and Pricing for a discussion on our offerings) 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to increase Adjusted EBITDA (See Item 6. Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data for a definition and history) and cash flow by effectively managing operations while growing and retaining our customer base as a retail distributor of home heating oil and propane and provider of related products and services. The key elements of this strategy include the following: 
 Pursue select acquisitions Our senior management team has developed expertise in identifying acquisition opportunities and integrating acquired customers into our operations. We focus on acquiring profitable companies within and outside our current footprint. 
 We actively pursue home heating oil only companies, propane companies, dual fuel (home heating oil and propane) companies and selectively target motor fuels acquisitions, especially where they are operating in the markets we currently serve. The focus for our acquisitions is both within our current footprint, as well as outside of such areas if the target company is of adequate size to sustain profitability as a stand-alone operation. We have used this strategy to expand into several states over the past five years. 
 
6 
 
Deliver superior customer service We are dedicated to consistently providing our customers with superior service and a positive customer experience to improve retention and drive additional revenue. We have established a Customer Experience Department and Voice of the Customer (VOC) Program to effectively measure customer satisfaction at certain brands. 
 VOC refers to a process (or program) designed to capture customers preferences and opinions of the service we deliver. The heart of the VOC program is based on transactional surveys with real-time results. We analyze customer input to gain business insights and share this information internally to create meaningful change throughout the company and improve overall customer satisfaction.
 We are also deploying Salesforce.com, a customer relationship management solution, at most of our larger brands. This will allow us to provide a more consistent customer experience as our employees will have a 360 degree-view of each customer with easy access to key customer information and customized dashboards to track individual employee performance. 
 We have created a specific department dedicated to training employees to provide superior and consistent service and enhance the customer experience. We also have a technical training committee to ensure that our field personnel are properly educated in using the latest technology in a safe and efficient manner. This effort is supported, reinforced and monitored by our local management teams. 
 Diversification of product and service offerings In addition to expanding our propane operations, we are focused on expanding our suite of rationally related products and services. These offerings include, but are not limited to, the sales, service and installation of heating and air conditioning equipment, plumbing services, and standby home generators. In addition, we also repair and install natural gas heating systems. We place significant emphasis on growing a solid, credit-worthy customer base with a focus on recurring revenue in the form of annual service agreements. 
 Geographic expansion We utilize census-based demographic data as well as local field expertise to target areas contiguous to our geographic footprint for organic expansion in a strategic manner. We then operate in such areas using a combination of existing logistical resources and personnel and, if warranted by the business demands or opportunity, adding locations. 
 We grow the business utilizing advertising and marketing initiatives to expand our presence while building an effective marketing database of prospects and customers.
 Seasonality 
 Our fiscal year ends on September 30. All references to quarters and years respectively in this document are to fiscal quarters and years unless otherwise noted. The seasonal nature of our business results in the sale of approximately 30% of our volume of home heating oil and propane in the first fiscal quarter and 50% of our volume in the second fiscal quarter of each fiscal year, the peak heating season. As a result, we generally realize net income in our first and second fiscal quarters and net losses during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and we expect that the negative impact of seasonality on our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results will continue. In addition, sales volume typically fluctuates from year to year in response to variations in weather, wholesale energy prices and other factors. 
Degree Day 
 A degree day is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption. Degree days are based on how far the average daily temperature departs from 65°F. Each degree of temperature above 65°F is counted as one cooling degree day, and each degree of temperature below 65°F is counted as one heating degree day. Degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a multi-year average to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual. Degree days are officially observed by the National Weather Service. 
 Every ten years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) computes and publishes average meteorological quantities, including the average temperature for the last 30 years by geographical location, and the corresponding degree days. The latest and most widely used data covers the years from 1981 to 2010. Our calculations of normal weather are based on these published 30 year averages for heating degree days, weighted by volume for the locations where we have existing operations. 
 Competition 
 Most of our operating locations compete with numerous distributors, primarily on the basis of price, reliability of service and response to customer needs. Each such location operates in its own competitive environment. 
 
7 
 
We compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors, such as ourselves, to those offering delivery only. As do many companies in our business, we provide home heating and propane equipment repair service on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week, 52 weeks a year basis. We believe that this level of service tends to help build customer loyalty. In some instances homeowners have formed buying cooperatives that seek a lower price than individual customers are otherwise able to obtain. Our business competes for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally natural gas, propane (in the case of our home heating oil operations) and electricity. 
 Customer Attrition 
 We measure net customer attrition for our full service residential and commercial home heating oil and propane customers. Net customer attrition is the difference between gross customer losses and customers added through marketing efforts. Customers added through acquisitions are not included in the calculation of gross customer gains. However, additional customers that are obtained through marketing efforts at newly acquired businesses are included in these calculations. Customer attrition percentage calculations include customers added through acquisitions in the denominators of the calculations on a weighted average basis. Gross customer losses are the result of a number of factors, including price competition, move outs, credit losses and conversions to natural gas. (See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Customer Attrition.) 
Customers and Pricing 
 Our full service home heating oil customer base is comprised of 97% residential customers and 3% commercial customers. Our residential customer receives on average 164 gallons per delivery and our commercial accounts receive on average 322 gallons per delivery. Typically, we make four to six deliveries per customer per year. Approximately 96% of our full service residential and commercial home heating oil customers have their deliveries scheduled automatically and 4% of our home heating oil customer base call from time to time to schedule a delivery. Automatic deliveries are scheduled based on each customers historical consumption pattern and prevailing weather conditions. Our practice is to bill customers promptly after delivery. We also offer a balanced payment plan in which a customers estimated annual oil purchases and service contract fees are paid for in a series of equal monthly payments. Approximately 34% of our residential home heating oil customers have selected this billing option. 
 We offer several pricing alternatives to our residential home heating oil customers. Our variable pricing program allows the price to float with the home heating oil market and other factors. In addition, we offer price-protected programs, which establish either a ceiling or a fixed price per gallon that the customer pays over a defined period. The following chart depicts the percentage of the pricing plans selected by our residential home heating oil customers as of the end of the fiscal year. 
 

 | September 30, | 
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014 | | 2013 | 
Variable | | 52.6 | % | | 53.2 | % | 51.4 | % | | 53.5 | % | 53.1 | %
Ceiling | | 37.1 | % | | 40.8 | % | 43.9 | % | | 40.8 | % | 42.3 | %
Fixed | | 10.3 | %(a) | | 6.0 | % | 4.7 | % | | 5.7 | % | 4.6 | %
 | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 (a) Approximately 2% of the increase in the percentage of accounts under fixed contracts is attributable to fiscal 2017 acquisitions. 
 Sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher per gallon margins than sales to commercial customers. Due to greater price sensitivity, our own internal marketing efforts, and hedging costs of residential price-protected customers, the per gallon margins realized from price-protected customers generally are less than from variable priced residential customers. 
 Derivatives 
 We use derivative instruments in order to mitigate our exposure to market risk associated with the purchase of home heating oil for our price-protected customers, physical inventory on hand, inventory in transit and priced purchase commitments. Currently, the Companys derivative instruments are with the following counterparties: Bank of America, N.A., Bank of Montreal, Cargill, Inc., Citibank, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Key Bank, N.A., Munich Re Trading LLC, Regions Financial Corporation, Societe Generale, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
 
8 
 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815-10-05, Derivatives and Hedging, requires that derivative instruments be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. To the extent derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective, as defined under this guidance, changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted hedged item is recognized in earnings. We have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as hedging instruments under this guidance, and as a result, the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments during the holding period are recognized in our statement of operations. Therefore, we experience volatility in earnings as outstanding derivative instruments are marked to market and non-cash gains and losses are recorded prior to the sale of the commodity to the customer. The volatility in any given period related to unrealized non-cash gains or losses on derivative instruments can be significant to our overall results. However, we ultimately expect those gains and losses to be offset by the cost of product when purchased. Depending on the risk being hedged, realized gains and losses are recorded in cost of product, cost of installations and services, or delivery and branch expenses. 
 Suppliers and Supply Arrangements 
 We purchase our product for delivery in either barge, pipeline or truckload quantities, and as of September 30, 2017 had contracts with approximately 90 third-party terminal sites for the right to temporarily store petroleum products at their facilities. Home heating oil and propane purchases are made under supply contracts or on the spot market. We have entered into market price based contracts for approximately 83% of our expected home heating oil and propane requirements for the fiscal 2018 heating season. We also have market price based contracts for approximately 43% of our expected diesel and gasoline requirements for fiscal 2018. 
 During fiscal 2017, Global Companies LLC and NIC Holding Corp. provided approximately 13% and 8%, respectively, of our petroleum product purchases. No other single supplier provided more than 8% of our product supply during fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, we generally have supply contracts for similar quantities with Global Companies LLC and NIC Holding Corp. Supply contracts typically have terms of 6 to 12 months. All of the supply contracts provide for minimum quantities and in most cases do not establish in advance the price of home heating oil or propane. This price is based upon a published market index price at the time of delivery or pricing date plus an agreed upon differential. We believe that our policy of contracting for the majority of our anticipated supply needs with diverse and reliable sources will enable us to obtain sufficient product should unforeseen shortages develop in worldwide supplies. 
 Home Heating Oil Price Volatility 
 In recent years, the wholesale price of home heating oil has been extremely volatile, resulting in increased consumer sensitivity to heating costs and possibly increased gross customer attrition. Like any other market commodity, the price of home heating oil is generally impacted by many factors, including economic and geopolitical forces. The price of home heating oil is closely linked to the price refiners pay for crude oil, which is the principal cost component of home heating oil. The volatility in the wholesale cost of home heating oil, as measured by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price per gallon for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 through 2017, on a quarterly basis, is illustrated by the following chart: 

 | Fiscal 2017 (2) | | Fiscal 2016 | | | Fiscal 2015 | | Fiscal 2014 | Fiscal 2013 (1) | 
 | Low | | High | | | Low | | High | Low | | High | | | Low | | High | Low | | High | 
Quarter Ended | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

Acquisitions 
 Part of our business strategy is to pursue select acquisitions. During fiscal 2017, the Company acquired four home heating oil dealers, two propane dealers and a plumbing service provider with a total of 28,300 home heating oil and propane accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $44.8 million; comprised of $43.3 million in cash and $1.5 million of deferred liabilities (including $0.6 million of contingent consideration). The gross purchase price was allocated $37.5 million to intangible assets, $10.2 million to fixed assets and reduced by $2.9 million in working capital credits. Each acquired companys operating results are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements starting on its acquisition date. Customer lists, other intangibles and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over seven to twenty years. 
 During fiscal 2016, we acquired a heating oil dealer, a motor fuel dealer, and two propane dealers with a total of 3,300 home heating oil and propane accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.8 million. The gross purchase price was allocated $7.4 million to intangible assets, $2.5 million to fixed assets and reduced by $0.1 million for working capital credits. 
 During fiscal 2015, we acquired three heating oil and propane dealers (with one dealer also having motor fuel accounts) with a total of 23,300 home heating oil and propane accounts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $20.8 million. The gross purchase price was allocated $21.8 million to intangible assets, $2.5 million to fixed assets and reduced by $3.5 million for working capital credits. 
 Employees 
 As of September 30, 2017, we had 3,362 employees, of whom 839 were office, clerical and customer service personnel; 947 were equipment technicians; 563 were fuel delivery drivers and mechanics; 616 were management and 397 were employed in sales. Of these employees 1,451 (43%) are represented by 61 different collective bargaining agreements with local chapters of labor unions. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and depending on the demands of the 2018 heating season, we anticipate that we will augment our current staffing levels during the heating season from among the 345 employees on temporary leave of absence as of September 30, 2017. There are 21 collective bargaining agreements up for renewal in fiscal 2018, covering approximately 381 employees (11%). We believe that our relations with both our union and non-union employees are generally satisfactory. 
 Government Regulations 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Generally, these laws impose limitations on the discharge or emission of pollutants and establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, and comparable state statutes. CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liabilities without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Products stored and/or delivered by us and certain automotive waste products generated by our fleet are hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA or otherwise subject to investigation and cleanup under other environmental laws and regulations. While we are currently not involved with any material CERCLA claims, and we have implemented programs and policies designed to address potential liabilities and costs under applicable environmental laws and regulations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties or injunctive relief in cases of non-compliance or impose liability for remediation costs. 
 We have incurred and continue to incur costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some of our locations, including legacy contamination at properties that we have acquired. A number of our properties are currently undergoing remediation, in some instances funded by prior owners or operators contractually obligated to do so. To date, no material issues have arisen with respect to such prior owners or operators addressing such remediation, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case. In addition, we have been subject to proceedings by regulatory authorities for alleged violations of environmental and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect any of these liabilities or proceedings of which we are aware to result in material costs to, or disruptions of, our business or operations. 
 
10 
 
Transportation of our products by truck are subject to regulations promulgated under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act. These regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the United States Department of Transportation or similar state agencies. Several of our oil terminals are governed under the United States Coast Guard operations Oversite, Federal OPA 90 FRP programs and Federal Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure programs. All of our propane bulk terminals are governed under Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards programs. We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations. We maintain various permits that are necessary to operate some of our facilities, some of which may be material to our operations.
