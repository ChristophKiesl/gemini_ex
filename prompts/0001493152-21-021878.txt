Merger with Bioventus, Inc.
 
On July 29, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) with Bioventus Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Bioventus”), Oyster Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Bioventus (“Merger Sub I”), and Oyster Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Bioventus (“Merger Sub II”) under which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified therein, Merger Sub I shall be merged with and into Misonix, with Misonix surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bioventus (the “First Merger”) and following the First Merger, Misonix shall be merged with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving as Misonix, LLC (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, the “Merger”). At the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Effective Time”), each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than the shares that are owned by Bioventus, Misonix, Merger Sub I or Merger Sub II and shares of any dissenting holders who are entitled to and have properly asserted appraisal rights) will be converted into the right to receive, either an amount in cash equal to $28.00 or 1.6839 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A common stock of Bioventus, $0.001 par value per share (each share, a “Bioventus Share”), based on the election of the holder thereof in accordance with the terms of, and subject to election, proration and adjustment procedures set forth in, the Merger Agreement.
 
Our Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of Bioventus have unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the required approvals of Misonix and Bioventus stockholders, respectively, and the receipt of regulatory approvals. Subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permissible) waiver of such conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
For additional information regarding the Merger, including associated risks and uncertainties, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Transaction” and Note 15 in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
 
Overview
 
Misonix, Inc. is a Delaware corporation based in Farmingdale, New York. Misonix was incorporated in connection with our acquisition of Solsys Medical in 2019 and became a successor to our current operating subsidiary, Misonix Op Co., which was incorporated in New York in 1967.
 
We design, manufacture, market, sell and distribute minimally invasive surgical ultrasonic medical devices. These products are used for precise bone sculpting, removal of soft and hard tumors, and tissue debridement, primarily in the areas of neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, plastic surgery, wound care and maxillo-facial surgery. We also exclusively market, sell and distribute skin allografts and wound care products used to support healing of wounds, and which complement our ultrasonic medical devices.
 
We strive to have our proprietary procedural solutions become the standard of care and enhance patient outcomes throughout the world. We intend to accomplish this, in part, by utilizing our best-in-class surgical ultrasonic technology to improve patient outcomes in neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, general surgery, plastic surgery and wound care. Our neXus generator combines the capabilities of our three legacy ultrasonic products into a single system that can be used to perform soft and hard tissue resections. We also continue to market and sell these legacy ultrasonic products, which are:



● | BoneScalpel Surgical System, or BoneScalpel, which is used for surgical procedures involving the precise cutting and sculpting of bone while sparing soft tissue. BoneScalpel is now recognized by many surgeons globally as a critical surgical tool enabling improved patient outcomes in the spine surgery arena. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SonaStar Surgical Aspirator, or SonaStar, which is used to emulsify and remove soft and hard tumors, primarily in the neuro and general surgery fields. 
● | SonicOne Wound Debridement System, or SonicOne, which offers tissue specific debridement and cleansing of wounds and burns for effective removal of devitalized tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable cells. 

 
These devices primarily serve the following clinical specialties: neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, general surgery, plastic surgery, wound care and maxillo-facial surgery.
 
Products
 
Each of our medical device systems consist of a proprietary console and handpiece that function to convert electrical current into ultrasonic energy, ultimately delivered via a disposable titanium tip, to produce a therapeutic effect.

neXus®
 
neXus is a next generation integrated ultrasonic surgical platform that combines all the features of our existing solutions, including BoneScalpel, SonicOne and SonaStar, into a single fully integrated platform that will also serve to power future solutions. The neXus platform is driven by a new proprietary digital algorithm that results in more power, efficiency, and control. The device incorporates Smart Technology that allows for easier setup and use.
 
neXus’ increased power improves tissue resection rates for both soft and hard tissue removal making it a unique surgical platform for a variety of different surgical specialties. In addition, neXus’ ease of use enables physicians to fully leverage neXus’ impressive set of capabilities via its digital touchscreen display and smart system setup. Our current ultrasonic applications, which are BoneScalpel, SonaStar and SonicOne, all work on the neXus generator. This allows a hospital to access all of our product offerings on this all-in-one console. We principally sell neXus in the United States.
 
BoneScalpel®
 
The BoneScalpel is a state of the art, ultrasonic bone cutting and sculpting system capable of enabling precise cuts with minimal necrosis, minimal burn artifact, minimal inflammation and minimal bone loss. The device is also capable of preserving surrounding soft tissue structures because of its ability to differentiate soft tissue from rigid bone. This device can make precise linear or curved cuts, on any plane, with precision not normally associated with powered instrumentation. We believe that BoneScalpel offers the speed and convenience of a powered instrument without the dangers associated with conventional rotary devices. The effect on surrounding soft tissue is minimal due to the elastic and flexible structure of healthy tissue. This is a significant advantage in anatomical regions like the spine where patient safety is of primary concern. In addition, the linear motion of the blunt, tissue-impacting tips avoids accidental ‘trapping’ of soft tissue while largely eliminating the high-speed spinning and tearing associated with rotary power instruments. The BoneScalpel allows surgeons to improve on existing surgical techniques by creating new approaches to bone cutting, sculpting, and removal, leading to substantial time-savings and increased operation efficiencies.
 
SonaStar®
 
The SonaStar System provides powerful and precise aspiration following the ultrasonic ablation of soft tissue. The SonaStar has been used for a wide variety of surgical procedures applying both open and minimally invasive approaches, including neurosurgery and general surgery. The SonaStar may also be used with OsteoSculpt® probe tips, which enable the precise shaping or shaving of bony structures that prevent open access to partially or completely hidden soft tissue masses.
 
SonicOne®
 
The SonicOne Ultrasonic Cleansing and Debridement System is a highly innovative, tissue specific approach for the effective removal of devitalized or necrotic tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable, surrounding cellular structures. The tissue specific capability is, in part, due to the fact that healthy and viable tissue structures have a higher elasticity and flexibility than necrotic tissue and are more resistant to destruction from the impact effects of ultrasound. The ultrasonic debridement process separates devitalized tissue from viable tissue layers, allowing for a more defined treatment and, usually, a reduced pain sensation. We believe that SonicOne establishes a new standard in wound bed preparation, the essential first step in the healing process, while contributing to a faster patient healing.
 
TheraSkin®
 
TheraSkin is a biologically active human skin allograft that has all of the relevant characteristics of human skin needed to heal wounds, including living cells, growth factors, and a collagen matrix. TheraSkin is derived from human skin tissue from consenting and highly screened donors and is regulated by the FDA as a Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product. LifeNet processes and supplies TheraSkin to us under a supply and distribution agreement that gives us exclusive rights to sell TheraSkin in the United States. TheraSkin is indicated for use on all external skin tissue wounds, including but not limited to difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, dehisced surgical wounds, necrotizing fasciitis, burns, Mohs and wounds with exposed structures.
 
Therion®
 
Therion is indicated for use as a cover and barrier for homologous use for wound care and surgical procedures. Therion is a dehydrated and terminally sterilized chorioamniotic allograft derived from human placental membrane and is regulated by the FDA as a Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product. CryoLife processes and supplies Therion to us under a supply and distribution agreement that gives us exclusive rights to distribute the product in the United States. CryoLife processes Therion using a proprietary process that removes the maternal-derived decidua cells from the placental membrane, leaving the amnion and chorion layers in their native configuration.
 
TheraGenesis®
 
TheraGenesis is a Bilayer Wound Matrix and Meshed Bilayer Wound Matrix consisting of a porcine collagen sponge layer and a silicone film layer that provides a scaffold for cellular invasion and capillary growth for management of wounds including partial and full-thickness wounds, chronic wounds, surgical wounds, trauma wounds and draining wounds. We obtain TheraGenesis under an exclusive supply and distribution agreement with Gunze Limited that gives us exclusive rights to distribute the product in the United States.

Sales and Distribution; Reportable Segments
 
In the United States, we sell our products through our direct sales force, in addition to a network of commissioned agents assisted by Misonix personnel. Outside of the United States, we sell BoneScalpel and SonaStar through distributors who then resell the products to hospitals. We sell to all major markets in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Africa.
 
We manufacture and sell our products in two global reportable business segments: the Surgical segment and the Wound segment. Our sales force also operates as two segments, Surgical and Wound Care.
 
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
In March of 2020, the World Health Organization designated the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a global pandemic. In March of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 and related actions to attempt to control its spread began to impact our consolidated operating results. Principally beginning in March 2020, year-over-year consolidated revenue trends began to weaken rapidly and materially. This trend continued through the end of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. While we have seen some gradual improvements in consolidated operating results during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, in part, due to elective surgical procedure volumes returning to pre-COVID-19 levels in some jurisdictions, several jurisdictions are experiencing new increases in the rate of infection by COVID-19 and have begun to divert resources to treat COVID-19 patients and re-defer elective surgical procedures.
 
We continue to execute on our business continuity plans and our crisis management response to address the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the course of the pandemic, our headquarters have generally remained open, with certain essential employees continuing to work in our facilities. We are generally following the requirements and protocols published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, and state and local governments and we continue to monitor the latest public health and government guidance related to COVID-19, including vaccine availability to our employees and protocols for social distancing and wearing of masks within our facilities. As a result of this guidance, we have begun to lift the actions put in place as part of our business continuity plans, including work from home requirements and travel restrictions. We cannot be certain, however, that we will not be required or encouraged to implement additional restrictions as new variants of the virus arise, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business. As of the date of this filing, we do not believe our work from home protocol has adversely affected our internal controls, financial reporting systems or our operations.
 
Our sales teams are focused on how to meet changing needs of our customers in this environment.
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a disruption to our global supply chain of our products and a decrease in sales due to a decrease in elective surgical procedures, as described in more detail below. While this disruption began to alleviate during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and continues to gradually improve, we could experience further variable impacts on our business if a resurgence of the virus or variants thereof emerge, elective procedures continue to be deferred or disruptions in the global supply chain worsen. The ultimate effect of these disruptions, including the extent of their adverse effect on our financial and operational results, will be impacted by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknown duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as variants of the virus arise and put stress on the healthcare system, the efficacy of any vaccines and related distributions, the number of cases presenting in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and the effect of governmental regulations and other restrictions that might be imposed in response to the pandemic.
 
Due to these effects and measures, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers diverted medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of that disease. In addition, our customers may delay, cancel, or redirect planned capital expenditures in order to focus resources on COVID-19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID-19. For example, as mentioned above, we have experienced and may continue to experience a significant decline in procedure volume in the U.S., as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. As mentioned above, while many countries are past their initial peak with COVID-19, many regions are now experiencing new increases in the rate of infection by COVID-19. To the extent individuals and hospital systems further de-prioritize, delay or cancel elective medical procedures, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations will further be negatively affected.
 
Capital markets and worldwide economies have also been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is possible that it could cause a local and/or global economic recession. Such economic recession could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business as hospitals and surgical centers curtail and reduce capital and overall spending. The COVID-19 pandemic and local actions, such as “shelter-in-place” orders and restrictions on our salesforce’s ability to travel and access our customers or temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers, could further significantly reduce our sales and our ability to ship our products and supply our customers. We are continuing to monitor closely indications that several jurisdictions are experiencing new increases in the rate of infection by COVID-19, which could result in further mitigation efforts, the impact of these new increases on all aspects of our business and geographies, including its impact on our customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, and distribution channels. Any of these events could negatively impact the number of surgical procedures performed using our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. There are certain limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of these items, including the fixed costs of our businesses. COVID-19 also makes it more challenging for us to estimate the future performance of our businesses, particularly over the near to medium term.
 
The extent to which the COVID-19 global pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict; these developments include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions taken to contain the virus or address its impact including vaccine distribution and efficacy, U.S. and foreign government actions to respond to the reduction in global economic activity, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations. The duration and severity of the resulting economic downturn and the broader impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, financial condition and operating results remains highly uncertain.
 
For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors- “Our business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets and communities in which we and our customers operate” and “The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted our operations and if we are unable to re-commence normal operations in the near-term, we may be out of compliance with certain covenants in our debt facilities.”

Impact of Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act and related rules and guidelines include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments, and estimated income tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. While the CARES Act contains these and various other corporate tax provisions; we do not expect these provisions to materially impact our current tax provision.
 
On April 5, 2020, we applied for an unsecured $5.2 million loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP Loan. The Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, was established under CARES Act and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. On April 10, 2020, the PPP loan was approved and funded. We entered into a promissory note with J.P, Morgan Chase evidencing the unsecured $5.2 million loan. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, we used the proceeds from the PPP Loan primarily for payroll costs. In October 2020, the SBA released guidance that allows borrowers an additional ten months of deferral of the start of principal and interest payments. Therefore, interest and principal payments are now deferred for the first sixteen months of the loan. Thereafter, monthly interest and principal payments are due until the loan is fully satisfied at the end of 24 months. The promissory note has a maturity date of April 4, 2022 and accrues interest at an annual rate of 0.98%. The promissory note evidencing the PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults and provisions of the promissory note. The PPP permits borrowers to apply for forgiveness for some or all of the loans based on meeting certain criteria. On May 26, 2021, we applied to the SBA for forgiveness of the loan. Such application is still outstanding.
 
Other than as outlined above, we do not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act may have on our business and financial results.


Customers
 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no customers whose sales accounted for more than 10% of our revenues.
 
Research & Development
 
As of June 30, 2021, our research and development organization consisted of a staff of 12 employees including engineers and technical and support personnel. Our in-house technical expertise includes mechanical engineering, acoustics, electrical engineering, software development and product design. The research and development group focuses principally on developing new products and supporting existing products.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
We largely manufacture and assemble our medical device products at our production facility located in Farmingdale, New York. Our products include components manufactured by other companies in the United States. We are dependent for some of the components used within our medical device products upon some single source suppliers and have worked to develop multi-sourced suppliers. We do not have long-term supply agreements. We may encounter difficulty in obtaining materials, supplies and components adequate for our anticipated short-term needs. In addition, supply disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the price of, and make more difficult to obtain, materials, supplies or components.
Competition
 
Competition in the medical device products industry is rigorous. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are product features, value-added solutions, reliability, clinical evidence, reimbursement coverage, and price. Customer support, reputation, and efficient distribution are also important factors. The speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of our products to the market are therefore important competitive factors. We compete with many companies having more significant capital resources, larger research laboratories and more extensive distribution systems than we do. Some of our major competitors are Johnson & Johnson, Integra Life Sciences, Inc., Söering, Stryker Corporation, Smith & Nephew, for our Surgical segment, and MiMedx, Smith & Nephew, Integra Life Sciences and Organogenesis for our Wound segment.
Regulatory Requirements
 
Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy, and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulations, or QSR, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are also subject to other governmental agency regulations of foreign agencies abroad.
United States
 
The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping of medical devices in order to ensure that those sold in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspension or loss of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.
 
Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Our products currently marketed in the United States are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device.” As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information.
 
As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including our third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions.
 
We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements, which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
 
Our labeling and promotional activities in the U.S. are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
International
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.

-

EEA
 
In the European Economic Area, (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, manufacturers of medical devices need to comply with the Essential Requirements laid out in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA.
 
The UK is currently in a transition period following the No-Deal Brexit, which ended on December 31, 2020. The UK’s post-Brexit medical device regulatory system, the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, passed into law on February 11, 2021. Guidance issued outlines a registration process where a manufacturer will contract a UK Responsible Person to assess the quality system in a similar manner to the EU MDD Notified Body. Compliance with developing UK regulations and a verification of compliance by the UK Responsible Person will be a requirement for products to be marketed or sold in the UK. Misonix continues to monitor the developing regulatory environment in the UK closely.
 
All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EEA must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to ISO13485: 2016 Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems Regulation and related manufacturing standards.
 
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them) in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The initial effective date of the Medical Devices Regulation was May 26, 2020 but was extended as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. New products placed on the market after May 26, 2021 must comply with the MDR. While we are able to continue marketing our currently CE-marked products in the EEA until the associated CE mark certificates expire, acquiring approvals for new products or renewing our existing CE mark certificates once these expire could be more challenging and costly.
 
Other Regulatory Bodies
 
Our devices are sold in multiple other countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the National Medical Products Administration in China (NMPA), Health Canada (HC), the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia, and the Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) in Brazil.
Other Healthcare Laws
 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA. The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we or our distributors regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, including distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.
 
ISO Standards
 
We also operate and maintain a Quality Management System that complies with the requirements of International Standards ISO 13485: 2016 Medical Devices – Quality Management Systems, including US FDA Title 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulation. This system encompasses the principles of enhancing customer satisfaction through the effective application of processes for control, monitoring, and continual improvement, which is designed to ensure that we consistently meet or exceed customer expectations and applicable statutory/regulatory requirements.
 
Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights
 
Patents, trademarks and other intangible proprietary rights are material to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and overseas for patentable subject matter in our products and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others.
 
We currently own 69 U.S. patents and 57 foreign patents. In addition, we have 17 pending U.S. patent applications and 53 pending foreign patent applications. Patents relating to our Nexus product are scheduled to expire in 2028 and 2040. Other patents that we consider important to our business will expire from 2025 to 2037, although we do not currently believe that the expiration of other patents will have a material effect on our business.
 
We also hold 19 U.S. and 7 foreign registered trademarks protecting the Misonix name and our product names.
 
We will continue to seek patent, trademark, and copyright protection as we deem advisable to protect the markets for our products and to support our research and development efforts.

Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third-party payors, including, in the U.S., the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors, such as health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, indemnity health insurers, employer group health insurance programs and managed care plans, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the products. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to be dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. Reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may be subject to periodic adjustments as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes, as well as budgetary pressures. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors, or denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products may affect our customers’ revenue and ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers’ healthcare services have the potential to significantly affect our operations and revenue.
Backlog
 
As of June 30, 2021, our backlog (firm orders that have not yet been shipped) was approximately $0.4 million as compared to $0.3 million as of June 30, 2020.
 
We ship most of our products on a just-in-time basis, which generally results in low levels of backlog.
 
Employees
