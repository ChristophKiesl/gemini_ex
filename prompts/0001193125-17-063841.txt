Item 1. Business 
The Company 
 Office Depot provides a broad selection of products and services to consumers and businesses of all sizes. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1986 and opened our first retail store in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At December 31, 2016, we operated through two reportable segments (or Divisions): North American Retail Division and North American Business Solutions Division. Following the third quarter 2016 commitment to sell substantially all of international operations outside of North America, the business formerly reported as the International Division has been reclassified to discontinued operations. 
 Sales for the Divisions are processed through multiple channels, consisting of office supply stores, a contract sales force, internet sites, an outbound telephone account management sales force, direct marketing catalogs and call centers, all supported by a network of supply chain facilities and delivery operations. Office Depot currently operates under the Office Depot and OfficeMax brands and utilizes other proprietary company and product brand names, including Grand & Toy in Canada. 
 Our primary public website is www.officedepot.com. The Companys primary brands are discussed in the Intellectual Property section below. 
 Additional information regarding our Divisions and operations in geographic areas is presented in Part II  Item 7. MD&A and in Note 16, Segment Information, of the Consolidated Financial Statements located in Part IV  Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report.

Discontinued Operations 
 On September 23, 2016, we announced that we had received an irrevocable offer from The AURELIUS Group to acquire substantially all of the business in Europe (the OD European Business). The transaction was structured as an equity sale with the buyer acquiring the OD European Business with its operating assets and liabilities. We retained the assets and obligations of a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom. 
 On December 31, 2016 we completed the sale of the OD European Business to The AURELIUS Group. 
 In addition to the sale of the OD European Business, we are actively marketing for sale the businesses in South Korea, mainland China, Australia and New Zealand (collectively the International Sale Group) and expect to complete the dispositions during 2017. The assets and liabilities of the entities expected to be sold are classified as held for sale and included in discontinued operations. We currently anticipate retaining the sourcing and trading operations of the former International Division, which are presented as Other in Note 16, Segment Information, of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Termination of Staples Acquisition 
 On February 4, 2015, Staples, Inc. (Staples) and the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement, under which Staples was to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Office Depot and we would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Staples. 
 On December 7, 2015, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) informed Office Depot and Staples that it intended to block the Staples Acquisition. On the same date, Office Depot and Staples announced their intent to contest the FTCs decision to challenge the transaction. 
 On May 10, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the FTCs request for a preliminary injunction against the proposed acquisition, and as a result, the companies announced the termination of the Staples Merger Agreement. Per the terms of the termination agreement, Staples paid Office Depot a fee of $250 million in cash on May 19, 2016. 
 Merger 
 On November 5, 2013, the Company merged with OfficeMax Incorporated (OfficeMax). 
 Refer to Note 2, Merger, Acquisition Termination, and Restructuring Activity for additional discussion of this merger (the Merger) and termination of the Staples acquisition. 
 Fiscal Year 
 Our fiscal year results are based on a 52- or 53-week retail calendar ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks and ended on December 31, 2016. Fiscal years 2015 and 2014 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively. The Companys business in Canada follows calendar periods with December 31 year-ends. The difference in reporting periods does not have a significant impact on the Companys reported results. 
North American Retail Division 
 The North American Retail Division sells a broad assortment of merchandise through our chain of office supply stores throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The retail stores operate under their legacy banners of Office Depot or OfficeMax, though systems, processes and offerings have

 converged. We currently offer products and services in the following categories: supplies, technology, and furniture and other. Refer to the Merchandising section below for additional product information. Most retail stores also offer copy and print services, as discussed in the Copy & Print Depot section below. 
 At the end of 2016, the North American Retail Division operated 1,441 office supply stores. The count of open stores may include locations temporarily closed for remodels or other factors. We have a broad representation across North America with the largest concentration of our retail stores in Texas, California, and Florida. The majority of our retail stores are located in leased facilities that currently average over 20,000 square feet. 
 As part of the integration of the Office Depot and OfficeMax stores, we announced our Real Estate Strategy in 2014, which included the planned closure of 400 stores in North America. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company completed the retail store closures under this program. In execution of this strategy, we closed 51 stores in 2016, 181 stores in 2015 and 168 stores in 2014. Closures included both Office Depot and OfficeMax locations. Implementation of this strategy resulted in charges for facility closures, termination costs, and asset impairments. In August 2016, we announced the Comprehensive Business Review that, among other things, included the anticipated closing of an additional 300 stores over the next three years. We closed 72 stores under this program during 2016 (for a total of 123 stores closed in 2016 under both programs) and anticipate closing approximately 75 during 2017 and the remainder in 2018. Refer to Part II  Item 7. MD&A for additional information on the store activity. 
 Concurrent with announcement of the Comprehensive Business Review, we announced the launch of our Store of the Future concept. These converted stores have been redesigned to enhance the customer experience through a curated assortment of products, better product adjacencies, easier navigation and signage and increased space dedicated to expanded services offerings. Many of these stores are approximately 15,000 square feet, which is lower than the existing average. Through the end of 2016, we have converted 25 locations to this new format and anticipate having about 100 stores converted by the end of 2017. We continue to adapt the design for features that have shown to be particularly valuable to shoppers. 
 To better serve our customers any way they choose to shop, we have embraced an omni-channel focus in our retail, contract and direct channels. For example, we now have a Buy Online-Pickup in Store offering in all locations and have added Buy Online-Ship from Store capability to over half of our locations. These features help provide products to our customers faster and enable us to better manage inventory across the Company. Store delivery is offered in select markets. Sales under these programs are serviced by store employees and fulfilled with store inventory and therefore are reported in the North America Retail Division results, including the computation of comparable store sales. 
 Refer to the North American Supply Chain discussion below for additional information about our supply chain network. 
 Sales and marketing efforts are integral to understanding the Divisions processes and management. These efforts are addressed after the Divisions discussions. 
 North American Business Solutions Division 
 The North American Business Solutions Division sells nationally branded and our own brands products and services to customers in the United States, including Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada. Office Depot customers are primarily served through a dedicated sales force, catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our internet sites. Refer to the Merchandising section below for additional product information. The North American Business Solutions Division also offers copy and print services, as discussed in the Copy & Print Depot section below. 
 Our contract sales channel employs a dedicated inside and field sales force that services the office supply needs to a range of small, medium and large-sized businesses. Our contract business customers also include various 
 
3 
 
 schools and local, state and national governmental agencies. We also enter into agreements with consortiums to sell to various entities and across industries, including governmental and non-profit entities, for non-exclusive buying arrangements. Sales to our contract customers that are fulfilled at Office Depot retail locations are included in the results of our North American Retail Division, while honoring their contract pricing, as applicable. Migration of the legacy OfficeMax customers to Office Depot systems is well underway and progresses with the integration of the supply chain. Customer conversion is anticipated to be substantially complete by the end of 2017, but will continue into 2018. 
 Our direct sales channel primarily serves small- to medium-sized customers. Direct customers can order products through our public websites, from our catalogs, or by phone. Website functionality provides customers the convenience of using the loyalty program and offers suggestions by product ratings, pricing, and brand, among other features. Customer orders are fulfilled through our common supply chain; refer to the North American Supply Chain discussion below for additional information on our supply chain network. 
 Copy & Print Depot
Office Depot Copy & Print Depot provides printing, digital imaging, reproduction, mailing, shipping through FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service, and other services. We also maintain nationwide availability of personal computer support and network installation service that provides our customers with in-home, in-office and in-store support for their technology needs. Sales are recognized by the respective Division based on how the customer order is serviced. 
North American Supply Chain 
 We operate a network of distribution centers (or DCs) and crossdock facilities across the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Our DCs operate to fulfill customer orders while crossdocks are smaller flow-through facilities where merchandise is sorted for distribution and shipped to fulfill the inventory needs of our retail locations. The DC and crossdock facilities costs, including real estate, technology, labor and inventory, are allocated to the North American Retail Division and North American Business Solutions Division based on the relative services provided. 
 Through the end of 2016, the Merger integration has resulted in the closure of 14 DCs and crossdock facilities. The changes to the supply chain related to the merger, including remaining planned closures and system conversions, are anticipated to be completed before the end of 2017. 
 We believe that inventory held in our DCs is at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated customer needs. Certain purchases are sent directly from the manufacturer to our customers or retail stores. Some supply chain facilities and some retail locations also house sales offices, showrooms, and administrative offices supporting our contract sales channel. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we operated 38 DC and crossdock facilities in the United States and Canada. Refer to Item 2. Properties for further information. 
 Out-bound delivery and inbound direct import operations are currently provided by us and third-party carriers. We have increased the number of our owned vehicles during 2016. 
 Merchandising 
 Our merchandising strategy is to meet our customers needs by offering a broad selection of branded office products, as well as our own branded products and services. The selection of our own branded products has increased in breadth and level of sophistication over time. We currently offer products under various labels, including Office Depot®, OfficeMax®, Foray®, Ativa®, TUL®, Realspace®, WorkPro®, Brenton Studio®, Highmark®, Grand & Toy® and Viking Office Products®.

We generally classify our products into three broad categories: (1) supplies, (2) technology, and (3) furniture and other. The supplies category includes products such as paper, writing instruments, office supplies, cleaning and breakroom items. The technology category includes products such as toner and ink, computers, tablets and accessories, printers, electronic storage, as well as services for technology products. The furniture and other category includes products such as desks, seating, and luggage, as well as sales in our copy and print centers. 
 Total Company sales by product group were as follows: 
 

 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
Supplies | | 45.2 | % | | 44.4 | % | 43.6% 
Technology | | 38.9 | % | | 40.2 | % | 41.2% 
Furniture and other | | 15.9 | % | | 15.4 | % | 15.2% 
 | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0%

 We buy substantially all of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, industry wholesalers, and other primary suppliers, including direct sourcing of our own brands products from domestic and offshore sources. We also enter into arrangements with vendors that can lower our unit product costs if certain volume thresholds or other criteria are met. For additional discussion regarding these arrangements, refer to Critical Accounting Policies in Part II  Item 7. MD&A. 
 We operate separate merchandising functions in the United States and Canada. Each group is responsible for selecting, purchasing, managing the product life cycle of our inventory, and managing pricing primarily for retail and direct selling channels. Organizationally, they are aligned under the same Corporate leadership. In recent years, we have increasingly used global offerings across the regions to further reduce our product cost while maintaining product quality. 
 We operate a global sourcing office in Shenzhen, China, which allows us to better manage our product sourcing, logistics and quality assurance. This office consolidates our purchasing power with Asian factories and, in turn, helps us to increase the scope of our own branded offerings. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 The Company regularly assesses consumer shopping behaviors which will help refine our strategy to identify and offer desired product assortment, shopping environment and purchasing methods. Identifying the most desirable and effective way to reach our customers and allowing them to shop through whichever channel they prefer will continue to be a priority in the future. These efforts have impacted the design of our Store of the Future, the extent, format and vehicles we use to advertise to and reach customers, our web page design, promotions and product offerings. 
 Our marketing programs are designed to attract and retain customers, drive frequency of customer visits, and increase customers spend in our stores and websites. We regularly advertise in major newspapers in most of our North American markets. We also advertise through local and national radio, network and cable television advertising campaigns, and direct marketing efforts, such as the internet and social networking. We have shifted some of our marketing efforts in recent periods to digital programs that enhance personalized offerings and promote customer satisfaction. 
 Our customer loyalty program provides customers with rewards that can be applied to future purchases or other incentives. These programs enable us to market more effectively to our customers and may change as customer preferences shift. 
 We perform periodic competitive pricing analyses to monitor each market, and prices are adjusted as necessary to further our competitive positioning. We generally target our everyday pricing to be competitive with other resellers of office products.

Our customer acquisition efforts regularly shift to vehicles and formats found to be most productive for reaching the targeted class of customer. We acquire customers through e-mail and social media campaigns, online affiliate connections, on-premises sales calls, outbound sales calls, and catalogs, among others. No single customer in any one Division accounts for more than 10% of our total sales or accounts receivable. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business is somewhat seasonal, with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter, following the back-to-business sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the back-to-school sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter. Certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles. Business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods. 
 With the exception of online purchases placed or fulfilled in our retail locations, online sales activities are reported in the North American Business Solutions. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We currently operate under the Office Depot®, OfficeMax®, and Grand & Toy® brand names. We hold trademark registrations domestically and worldwide and have numerous other applications pending worldwide for the names Office Depot, Viking, Ativa, Foray, Realspace, OfficeMax, TUL, WorkPro, Brenton Studio, Highmark and others. As with all domestic trademarks, our trademark registrations in the United States are for a ten year period and are renewable every ten years, prior to their respective expirations, as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We also hold issued patents and pending patent applications domestically for certain private brand products, such as shredders, binders, and writing instruments. 
Industry and Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. We compete with office supply stores, wholesale clubs, discount stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers, food and drug stores, computer and electronics superstores and direct marketing companies. These companies compete with us in substantially all of our current markets. Increased competition in the office products markets, together with increased advertising, and internet-based search tools, has heightened price awareness among end-users. Such heightened price awareness has led to margin pressure on office products and impacted our results. In addition to price, we also compete based on customer service, the quality and extent of product selection and convenience. Other office supply retail companies market similarly to us in terms of store format, pricing strategy, product selection and product availability in the markets where we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial resources, which provide them with greater purchasing power, increased financial flexibility and more capital resources for expansion and improvement, which may enable them to compete more effectively. We anticipate that in the future we will continue to face high levels of competition from these companies. 
 We believe our customer service and the efficiency and convenience for our customers from our combined contract and direct distribution channels help our North American Business Solutions Division to compete with other business-to-business office products distributors. 
 We believe our North American Retail Division segment competes based on convenience, location, the quality of our customer service, our store formats, the range and depth of our merchandise offering and our pricing. 
 Employees 
 As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately 38,000 employees in continuing operations.

Environmental Matters 
 As both a significant user and seller of paper products, we have developed environmental practices that are values-based and market-driven. Our environmental initiatives center on three guiding principles: (1) recycling and pollution reduction; (2) sustainable forest management; and (3) issue awareness and market development for environmentally preferable products. We offer thousands of different products containing recycled content and technology recycling services. 
 Office Depot continues to implement environmental programs in line with our stated environmental vision to increasingly buy green, be green and sell green  including environmental sensitivity in our packaging, operations and sales offerings. We have been commended for our leadership position for our facility design, recycling efforts, and green product offerings. Additional information on our achievements and green product offerings can be found at www.officedepotcitizenship.com/planet/ and www.officedepot.com/buygreen. 
 We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations related to historical OfficeMax operations of paper and forest products businesses and timberland assets. We record environmental and asbestos liabilities, and accrue losses associated with these obligations, when probable and reasonably estimable. We record a separate insurance recovery receivable when considered probable. Refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings for additional information.
