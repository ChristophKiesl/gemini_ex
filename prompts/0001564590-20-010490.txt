 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis, or OA, a type of degenerative arthritis. We have an approved product, ZILRETTA®, which we market in the United States. ZILRETTA is the first and only extended-release, intra-articular, or IA (meaning in the joint), injection indicated for the management of OA knee pain. ZILRETTA is a non-opioid therapy that employs our proprietary microsphere technology to provide effective pain relief. The pivotal Phase 3 trial, on which the approval of ZILRETTA was based, showed that ZILRETTA met the primary endpoint of pain reduction at Week 12, with statistically significant pain relief extending through Week 16. 
 ZILRETTA was approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or FDA, on October 6, 2017 and launched in the United States shortly thereafter. We market ZILRETTA to prescribing physicians through our own field sales force of approximately 110 Musculoskeletal Business Managers, or MBMs.
 ZILRETTA combines a commonly administered steroid, triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, with poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, referred to as PLGA, delivering a 32 mg dose of TA to provide extended therapeutic concentrations in the joint and persistent analgesic effect. Both the magnitude and duration of pain relief provided by ZILRETTA in clinical trials were clinically meaningful with the magnitude of pain relief amongst the largest seen to date in OA clinical trials. The overall frequency of treatment-related adverse events in these trials was similar to those observed with placebo and no drug-related serious adverse events were reported. 
 Based on the strength of our pivotal and other clinical trials, we believe that ZILRETTA represents an important treatment option for the millions of patients in the U.S. who are in need of safe and effective extended relief from OA knee pain.  ZILRETTA is uniquely distinguished by the following attributes:

ZILRETTA has demonstrated significant, durable relief for OA knee pain and, as such, can address an important unmet need among patients, physicians and healthcare payers. We believe that ZILRETTA holds the potential to become the leading IA medicine for OA knee pain. 
 In December 2018, we submitted a supplemental New Drug Application, or sNDA, to the FDA to revise the product label for ZILRETTA to allow for repeat administration. The sNDA submission was based on data from a Phase 3b single-arm, open-label clinical trial which evaluated the safety and tolerability of repeat administration of ZILRETTA. On December 26, 2019, we announced that the FDA approved the sNDA. The revised product label removed language which previously stated that ZILRETTA was “not intended for repeat administration” and replaced it with language stating that “the efficacy and safety of repeat administration of ZILRETTA have not been demonstrated.” FDA determined that because the data were not from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the Phase 3b results were insufficient to warrant full removal of a Limitation of Use statement, or LOU. The new label includes a study description and safety data from the Phase 3b repeat administration trial and nonclinical toxicology data from previously submitted single and repeat administration studies in non-diseased animals. In addition, the revised label removed a statement that described a single secondary exploratory endpoint in the original Phase 3 pivotal trial comparing ZILRETTA to immediate release TA crystalline suspension. 
 We believe ZILRETTA’s extended-release profile may also provide effective treatment for OA pain of the shoulder and adhesive capsulitis (AC), commonly referred to as “frozen shoulder,” and in December 2019, we initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy of ZILRETTA in patients with either shoulder OA or AC.  The data are anticipated in 2021.
 OA is a type of degenerative arthritis that is caused by the progressive breakdown and eventual loss of cartilage in one or more joints. Arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the U.S. and OA is the most common joint disease, affecting more than 30 million adults in the U.S. and these numbers are expected to grow as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries. OA commonly affects large weight-bearing joints like the knees and hips, but also occurs in the shoulders, hands, feet and spine. Patients with OA suffer from joint pain, tenderness, stiffness and limited movement. As the disease progresses, it becomes increasingly painful and debilitating, culminating, in many cases, in the need for total joint arthroplasty, or TJA.
 Because there is no cure for OA, controlling pain and delaying surgery are the primary goals of prescribing clinicians. Oral drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, including COX II inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, as well as topical NSAIDs, are used to treat early-stage OA pain but have limited effect and, given the amount and frequency of use in OA patients, are associated with serious side effects. For example, NSAIDs have shown increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Furthermore, this class of drugs can cause serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach or intestines. These serious side effects are particularly worrisome because OA patients often have co-existing medical conditions, including diabetes and hypertension. For patients with moderate to severe OA pain, IA medicines, such as immediate-release steroids and hyaluronic acid, or HA, injected into the joint, are generally considered well-tolerated, but they leave the joint rapidly and often fail to produce or maintain clinically meaningful pain relief. Physicians may prescribe opioids, which in addition to the serious risk of addiction and abuse, have numerous serious side effects including respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, cardiac events and, increasingly, deaths from unintentional overdose. As a result of these limitations, many OA patients experience persistent and worsening pain, which often culminates in the decision to have TJA, a painful and expensive procedure. Further, because the initial joint replacement wears out over time, the younger the patient is at the time of the joint replacement, the more likely it is that he or she will require repeat surgery in their lifetime.
 According to IQVIA, in 2018 approximately 5 million patients in the U.S. received an IA injection treatment for knee OA pain. That population was comprised of approximately 4.5 million patients who were treated with immediate-release steroids and roughly 900,000 patients who received hyaluronic acid, or HA, with some patients receiving both treatments in the same year. The HA utilization occurred despite guidance from prominent medical societies, including the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons stating that HA is an ineffective treatment for knee OA, and a number of major commercial payers no longer reimburse for the entire class of HA products. In addition, according to SmartTRAK in 2018, HA sales in the U.S. were $1 billion, with a cost per course of treatment ranging from $245 to $2,000. Our market research indicates that, given the limitations of immediate-release steroids 
 5


and HAs, physicians are open to new treatment options, like ZILRETTA, which can provide their patients with enhanced durable pain relief.
 We have established a clinical trial program designed to expand ZILRETTA’s product label, and we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 2 trial of ZILRETTA in both shoulder OA and adhesive capsulitis. IQVIA data indicate that, in 2018, healthcare practitioners administered roughly 600,000 immediate release steroid injections for the treatment of shoulder OA. An additional approximately 200,000 injections were administered to patients for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis. 
 We have a growing pipeline with two product candidates focused on the local treatment of musculoskeletal conditions: FX201 and FX301. FX201, is a gene therapy product candidate designed to stimulate the production of an anti-inflammatory protein, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), with the goal of providing at least one year of pain relief from OA of the knee and improving function. Based on its mechanism of action, we believe FX201 also holds the potential to arrest disease progression. In October of 2019, the FDA cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for FX201, allowing for initiation of a Phase 1 dose-escalation study. If data from that study are supportive, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 proof of concept trial in 2021.  
 FX301, is a locally administered NaV1.7 inhibitor, known as funapide, formulated for extended release in a thermosensitive hydrogel. The initial development of FX301 is intended to support administration as a peripheral nerve block for management of post-operative pain. We believe FX301 has the potential to provide effective, non-opioid pain relief for 3-5 days, while preserving extremity motor function, which is typically compromised by local anesthetic peripheral nerve block. We held a pre-IND meeting with FDA in January, and we remain on track to initiate FX301 clinical trials in 2021.
 We have worldwide commercialization rights for ZILRETTA, FX201 and FX301. We also have an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Southwest Research Institute, or SwRI®, with respect to the use of SwRI’s proprietary microsphere manufacturing technologies for certain steroids formulated with PLGA, including ZILRETTA. Our PLGA formulation technology is protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets, and proprietary know-how.  In addition, we own or have rights to various trademarks, copyrights and trade names used in our business, including FLEXION®, ZILRETTA® and FLEXFORWARD®. Our logos and trademarks are the property of Flexion Therapeutics, Inc.  All other brand names or trademarks appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders. Use or display by us of other parties’ trademarks, trade dress, or products in this report is not intended to, and does not, imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us, by the trademark or trade dress owners.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to cost-effectively discover, develop and commercialize novel, locally administered medicines that can safely and effectively address significant unmet medical needs associated with musculoskeletal conditions, with a particular interest in OA, post-operative pain and low back pain. The principal elements of our strategy include the following:

• | Establish ZILRETTA as the leading IA treatment for OA knee pain and maximize its value by expanding approved indications. Based on ZILRETTA’s clinical profile, we believe that it can be the first-line IA therapy for OA knee pain. Immediate-release IA steroids leave the joint rapidly and typically fail to confer pain relief of sufficient magnitude or duration. Since, by medical practice, steroids typically are not injected more frequently than every three months, patients can experience a recurrence in, or increasing, pain during that time. ZILRETTA is specifically formulated using our proprietary PLGA-based microsphere technology to slowly and continuously release drug in the joint for over 12 weeks. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ZILRETTA is currently approved for the treatment of OA knee pain, but we believe that it has the potential for broader use, specifically in the shoulder. In December 2019, we initiated a Phase 2 trial of ZILRETTA in OA shoulder pain and adhesive capsulitis.
  
• | Bolster our robust pipeline of high-quality product candidates to address unmet medical needs. We seek to progress our product candidates, FX201 and FX301, and further build our product pipeline 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6


 
through a combination of internal research and selective business development activities. In 2017, we established the Flexion Innovation Lab in Woburn, Massachusetts to support our research and development activities.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our infrastructure to efficiently and cost-effectively develop and commercialize ZILRETTA and our product candidates. We have built up extensive knowledge, expertise and capabilities in the development and commercialization of locally delivered medicines for musculoskeletal conditions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retain commercial rights in the United States and selectively partner outside of the United States. Because IA therapies in the United States are administered by a relatively small number of specialists, particularly orthopedists and rheumatologists, we believe we can realize the greatest value for our shareholders by fully exploiting our know-how and capabilities. The U.S. represents the most attractive market for ZILRETTA, and potentially for FX201 and FX301, and as a result, we aim to retain the commercial rights to our product and programs in the U.S. while we look to selectively partner outside of the United States.

Overview
 Osteoarthritis
 OA, also referred to as degenerative joint disease, is the most common joint disease in the U.S. according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, affecting more than 30 million adults. These numbers are expected to grow in the years ahead as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries.

• | According to the CDC, approximately 40% of U.S. adults are obese, which increases the risk of developing OA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Knee injury is common, particularly amongst young athletes, and increases the risk of developing OA later in life by more than five-fold.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | OA accounts for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures, which does not include loss of productivity costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | According to a study published by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International, U.S. patients with symptomatic radiographic knee OA were 23% more likely to die prematurely than people free from OA independent of age, sex, and race.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 According to the CDC, one of every two people in the U.S. is expected to develop symptomatic knee OA, the most common form of OA during their lifetime. Recent research estimates that the average age of physician-diagnosed knee OA has fallen by 16 years, from age 72 in the 1990s to age 56 in the 2010s. According to the same research, U.S. adults between the ages of 35 and 84 in the early 2010s will account for approximately 6.5 million new cases of knee OA over the next decade.
 OA is a progressive disease for which there is no cure. As a result, current treatments are intended to address the symptoms of OA, in particular, relief of pain and improvement in functional status. The therapeutic regimen for OA becomes increasingly invasive with progression of the disease, culminating, in many cases, in TJA. In addition, because patients are being diagnosed with OA earlier in their lives, many patients require repeat TJAs. Because the decision to have TJA is based in large part on intractable pain and functional impairment, we believe that therapies which can meaningfully and durably relieve pain and improve function could potentially delay TJA.
 Common Treatments for OA
 In early-stage disease, treatment begins with non-pharmacologic therapy including exercise, weight control and physical therapy. As the disease progresses, physicians prescribe pharmacologic therapy, typically beginning with acetaminophen and progressing to oral NSAIDs, including COX II inhibitors, topical NSAIDs or SNRIs. Physicians may also treat OA pain with opioids; however, these drugs have serious drawbacks and are generally considered to be a suboptimal therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, like that associated with OA. 
 When non-pharmacologic therapy and oral pain medications prove inadequate, physicians typically transition patients to IA injections. Immediate-release steroids have historically served as the first line IA therapy, and TA, the corticosteroid used in ZILRETTA, is amongst the most commonly prescribed IA corticosteroid injections. When 
 7


immediate-release steroids no longer provide sufficiently durable pain relief, patients may progress to IA HA, a significantly more expensive therapy with only marginally greater effect than placebo. 
 Due to severe pain that can no longer be controlled therapeutically, many patients opt to have TJA, which is costly and painful. One of the most prevalent TJA procedures in the U.S. is total knee arthroplasty. Compared to existing drug therapy, total knee arthroplasty is very expensive, with average costs ranging between $25,000 and $60,000, and many patients (~20%) are dissatisfied with the outcome of this procedure. The earlier a patient receives TJA, the more likely it is that the knee implant will wear out over time and they will require revision surgery in following years. According to IQVIA, in 2018, there were approximately 1.3 million total knee arthroplasties performed in the U.S. 
 Limitations of Common Treatments for OA
 Oral therapies, such as NSAIDs, may offer adequate analgesia for early-stage OA pain, but they may be associated with serious side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events and other adverse events.  For example, SNRIs may have a role in worsening depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients. In addition to their serious side effects, oral drugs may provide limited pain relief and eventually can become insufficient to control OA pain for many patients as the disease progresses.
 IA therapies, including immediate-release steroids and HA therapies, are generally well-tolerated but provide pain relief that is often insufficient or inadequate in duration. Historically, all IA steroid therapies approved for OA are immediate-release suspensions or solutions that leave the joint within hours to days, and they are rapidly absorbed systemically, which may result in undesirable side effects. For example, IA immediate-release steroid injections are associated with a rapid elevation of blood glucose in diabetics, which can be of clinical concern. While IA steroids demonstrate large initial analgesic effects relative to other therapies, as a result of leaving the joint quickly, IA steroids typically fail to confer pain relief of sufficient magnitude or duration. In addition, current clinical practice generally indicates that IA steroid suspensions not be administered more frequently than once every three months. Based on market research we have recently conducted, approximately 50% of patients surveyed who received IA immediate-release steroids were unsatisfied with the duration of benefit.
 Despite estimated U.S. sales of approximately $1 billion in 2018, IA HA therapies, which are approved only for treatment in the knee, produce only marginally more effective pain relief than placebo and may have no discernible effect on a patient’s ability to carry out their daily activities. In treatment guidelines for non-operative management of knee OA published in May 2013, both the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) concluded that data from then-current published studies did not show clinically meaningful effectiveness for HA injections. As a result, the guidelines do not recommend HA treatment for symptomatic knee OA due to lack of efficacy and, most recently, certain insurance carriers are no longer providing policy coverage of HA.
 While the consequences from the overuse and abuse of opioids are well-known, these powerful medicines are still commonly prescribed for OA related pain, despite the fact that they are not an effective treatment for this chronic condition. A recent study estimated that as many as 70% of patients who are prescribed a medicine for OA pain will receive an opioid because physicians have so few effective treatment options. We further believe that the growing societal awareness of the risks posed by opioids may make new treatment options attractive for patients and physicians seeking non-opioid alternatives. Beyond the significant concerns related to the potential for overuse, abuse and unintentional overdose, opioid use is also associated with a host of other serious side effects including, respiratory depression, hypotension, constipation, cardiac events and, increasingly, death.
 The Flexion Extended-Release Technology 
 Our extended-release technology allows us to incorporate active pharmaceutical ingredients in PLGA microspheres. We believe we are the first company to administer PLGA microspheres into a human joint. PLGA is a proven extended-release delivery vehicle that is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water as it releases drug in the IA space and is used in other approved drug products and surgical devices. The technology is designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing extended-release of drugs over time and the physical properties of the polymer-drug matrix can be varied to achieve specified drug loads and release rates. Key to the success of our IA therapies is the ability to maintain persistent concentrations of drug in the joint, while minimizing systemic 
 8


exposure. Utilizing our PLGA microsphere technology, ZILRETTA is the first and only approved extended-release, IA therapy for patients confronting OA-related knee pain.  
 We believe ZILRETTA and our technology will be protected primarily through a combination of patents, trade secrets and proprietary know-how, and we intend to seek marketing exclusivity for any approved products. A composition of matter patent has been issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, for ZILRETTA, with a patent term into 2031. The U.S. PTO has also issued two patents directed at the methods of manufacturing and using ZILRETTA with patent terms into 2031. Considerable expertise and effort were required to carry out the large body of original work underlying the formulation of ZILRETTA, including experimenting with, and observing the effects of over 50 steroid and PLGA formulations. We believe our extensive know-how and trade secrets relating to the manufacturing process for ZILRETTA, including those that relate to precise pharmaceutical release profiles, represent a meaningful entry barrier.
 The Flexion Pipeline
 Our pipeline strategy is to continue to study ZILRETTA in other areas and, if feasible, expand ZILRETTA’s product label to include additional indications and broaden its scope of administration, advance our other product candidates, FX201 and FX301, through clinical development and build a robust pipeline of additional locally administered therapies to address musculoskeletal conditions. 
 

FX201
 FX201 is an IA gene therapy candidate which is designed to induce the local production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), an anti-inflammatory protein. Preclinical data suggest that following injection of FX201, its genetic material is incorporated into local cells, and IL-1Ra is expressed in response to inflammation in the joint tissues. Inflammation is a known cause of pain, and chronic inflammation is thought to play a major role in the progression of OA. By persistently suppressing inflammation, we believe FX201 has the potential to both reduce pain and possibly arrest disease progression. In early October 2019, the FDA cleared the IND application for FX201, and we subsequently initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human trial. Nonclinical safety and efficacy data submitted in the IND application indicated that a single administration of FX201 was well-tolerated, had no significant biodistribution outside the target tissues, and pharmacology studies with the rat, mouse, and horse orthologues in animal models of OA showed symptomatic improvement and delay in disease progression. Positive data showing dose-dependent decreases in the severity of cartilage and bone lesions following anterior cruciate ligament transection in rats were presented at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in November 2019. The preclinical data established a potentially safe and efficacious starting dose for the Phase 1 single ascending dose study. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 15 - 24 patients who will be followed for 104 weeks, with initial 
 9


readout anticipated in 2021. In March 2020, the first two patients were treated in the Phase 1 dose-escalation trial. We acquired the global rights to FX201 from GeneQuine Biotherapeutics GmbH, or GeneQuine, and have an exclusive license to the underlying intellectual property rights for human use of FX201 from Baylor College of Medicine, or Baylor.  
 FX301
 In September 2019, we acquired global rights to develop and commercialize XEN402, Xenon’s NaV1.7 inhibitor known as funapide, for management of post-operative pain. Our FX301 preclinical product candidate consists of funapide formulated for extended release within a thermosensitive hydrogel, for administration as a peripheral nerve block for control of post-operative pain. The proprietary formulation of the thermosensitive hydrogel was developed in our Innovation Lab. Within minutes following injection, the thermosensitive formulation has been shown to transition from a liquid to a gel, an effect that we believe can provide local delivery of funapide near target nerves for up to a week. Unlike typical local anesthetics, the selective pharmacology of funapide has the potential to provide effective non-opioid pain relief for 3-5 days, while preserving extremity motor function, which is typically compromised by local anesthetic peripheral nerve block. As such, we believe FX301 could enable ambulation, rapid discharge, and early rehabilitation following musculoskeletal surgery. We are conducting preclinical toxicology studies, and if supportive, we anticipate filing an IND application to initiate FX301 clinical trials in 2021.
 ZILRETTA – FDA Approved Product for the Management of OA Knee Pain
 Key Regulatory Developments
 On October 6, 2017, ZILRETTA received approval from the FDA for the management of OA pain of the knee. ZILRETTA is the first and only approved extended-release, IA therapy for OA knee pain. It is a non-opioid medicine that employs our proprietary microsphere technology to provide proven pain relief. The approval was based upon data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, a randomized, double-blind study which evaluated 484 patients at 37 centers worldwide. The pivotal Phase 3 trial showed that ZILRETTA met the primary endpoint of pain reduction at Week 12, with statistically significant pain relief extending through Week 16. ZILRETTA’s label reflects its strong safety profile and states the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) in clinical studies included sinusitis, cough and contusions. 
 In December 2018, we submitted a sNDA to the FDA to revise the product label for ZILRETTA to allow for repeat administration. The sNDA submission was based on data from a Phase 3b single-arm, open-label clinical trial. 
 On December 26, 2019, we announced that the FDA approved the sNDA. The revised product label removed language which previously stated that ZILRETTA was “not intended for repeat administration” and replaced it with language stating that “the efficacy and safety of repeat administration of ZILRETTA have not been demonstrated.” FDA determined that because the data generated were not from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the Phase 3b results were insufficient to warrant full removal of a LOU statement. The new label includes a study description and safety data from the Phase 3b repeat administration trial and nonclinical toxicology data from previously submitted single and repeat administration studies in non-diseased animals. In addition, the revised label removed a statement that described a single secondary exploratory endpoint in the original Phase 3 pivotal trial comparing ZILRETTA to immediate release TA crystalline suspension.
 Summary of Active and Key Completed Clinical Trials 
 Prior to FDA approval, we completed seven clinical trials evaluating ZILRETTA (also known as FX006) against either immediate release TA crystalline suspension, or TAcs, placebo (saline), or both in patients with OA of the knee. In total, 424 patients were treated with a single IA injection (32mg) of ZILRETTA in those trials.   
Active Clinical Trials

• | We believe ZILRETTA’s extended-release profile may also provide effective treatment for OA pain of the shoulder and adhesive capsulitis (AC), commonly referred to as “frozen shoulder”, and in December 2019, we initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial to evaluate the efficacy of ZILRETTA in patients with either shoulder OA or AC. The study is expected to enroll up to 250 patients – approximately 135 with shoulder OA and 115 with shoulder AC.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Phase 2 trial, known as the RANGE study, separates cohorts of patients by their diagnosis of shoulder OA or AC into two parallel groups. Patients in each cohort are randomized (1:1) to either a single intra-articular injection of ZILRETTA or normal saline. The primary endpoint for both cohorts of the trial is the magnitude of pain relief versus placebo as measured by the overall change in daily shoulder pain with movement score from baseline to 8 weeks post injection. Patients in each cohort are then stratified by baseline pain scores. Shoulder AC patients are further stratified by pain duration since onset, and they also utilize a home exercise program during the study.
 
Each participant will be evaluated for 24 weeks following injection. The trial is expected to be completed in 2021.
 
 
• | In May 2018, we initiated an open-label Phase 3b trial assessing the effect of a single administration of ZILRETTA on synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane) in patients with OA of the knee. Patients in the study undergo initial ultrasound examination and MRI scans with contrast of the index knee at baseline and then return to the clinic at Weeks 6 and 24 for MRI scans and other assessments. We completed a primary endpoint analysis of our open-label, single-arm, Phase 3b trial assessing the effect of a single administration of ZILRETTA on synovitis in patients with knee OA. The data indicate that treatment with ZILRETTA resulted in a significant reduction (>50%) in synovial tissue volume at Week 6 compared to baseline (N=89 patients). These patients also reported improvements in pain and function scores over this time period. Patients continued to be followed in the trial to capture additional, longer-term exploratory measures as synovitis, or inflammation of the synovial membrane, is believed to play an important role in the progression of OA.

Additional Completed Studies
 
 
• | In February 2019, results from an open-label Phase 3b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of repeat administration of ZILRETTA in patients with OA of the knee were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Rheumatology and Therapy. The data indicated that repeat administration of ZILRETTA for treatment of OA knee pain was safe and well tolerated with no deleterious impact on cartilage or joint structure observed through X-ray analysis conducted at baseline and Week 52. The primary endpoint of the study was the safety and tolerability of repeat administration of ZILRETTA in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee. The patients enrolled in the study generally had longstanding and extensive disease, with more than two-thirds of the participants presenting with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) Grade 3 (37.5%) or Grade 4 (30.3%), the most radiographically severe form of OA. The data also indicate that the magnitude and duration of pain relief experienced by patients after both the first and second injections was comparable and similar to the clinical benefit of ZILRETTA in the pivotal Phase 3 trial. These data served as the basis for our aforementioned sNDA and subsequent label update. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In April 2019, we announced that results from a post-hoc analysis of data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of ZILRETTA were published in Advances in Therapy. The findings indicated that patients with unilateral OA knee pain experienced significant and durable pain relief with a single intra-articular injection of ZILRETTA compared to TAcs as measured by ADP scores. These results suggest that bilateral knee pain may have been a confounding factor in the pivotal trial, which assessed the impact of ZILRETTA treatment in only one knee.

• | At the 2019 Osteoarthritis Research Society International World Congress (OARSI) held in May, we presented positive results from the Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) study evaluating ZILRETTA in patients with hip OA. The data showed PK profiles consistent with previous studies in the knee. Additionally, we presented a poster on the previously published Phase 3b data indicating repeat administration of ZILRETTA resulted in substantial improvements in OA knee pain and had no deleterious impact on cartilage or joint structure. We also gave an

• | In May 2019, we announced that results from a pooled analysis of data from three Phase 2/3 randomized clinical trials on the use of rescue medications with ZILRETTA were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Pain and Therapy. The analysis showed that the overall number of rescue medication tablets used per day through Week 24 was significantly less for ZILRETTA compared to both saline-placebo (LSM difference, −0.43) and immediate-release TAcs (–0.24). The safety profile of ZILRETTA in this pooled analysis was consistent with that of the pivotal Phase 3 trial.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Also in May 2019, we paused enrollment in a Phase 3 trial of ZILRETTA in hip OA pain due to a non-safety related issue which resulted in the inability to deliver a full dose in a small number of trial participants. In November, we determined that an exploratory study designed to resolve the issue was unsuccessful, and as a result, we made the decision to discontinue the Phase 3 trial.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In July 2019, we presented new findings from a post-hoc subgroup analysis based onKL Grade of the open-label Phase 3b repeat administration trial of ZILRETTA in patients with knee OA at the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM). The analysis, which evaluated the efficacy of initial and repeat administration of ZILRETTA in patients with symptomatic knee OA ranging in radiographic severity from KL Grades 2 to 4, indicated that ZILRETTA consistently reduced OA knee pain for at least 12 weeks after each injection, regardless of KL Grade. The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, or AEs were similar across all KL Grades and the most commonly reported AEs were consistent with those reported in previous clinical studies of ZILRETTA.

• | In October 2019, we announced that results from a Phase 2a study evaluating the safety and systemic exposure of concurrent injections of ZILRETTA in patients with bilateral knee OA were published in the peer-reviewed journal, Therapeutic Advances in Musculoskeletal Disease. Findings from the open-label randomized study showed that concurrent, bilateral administration of ZILRETTA appeared safe and well tolerated, resulting in reduced systemic exposure and substantially lower plasma concentrations of TA compared to immediate-release TAcs.

Manufacturing
 We believe that the multifaceted nature of PLGA drug product manufacturing and the limited number of capable contract manufacturing companies that offer PLGA drug product manufacturing creates an entry barrier. The technology is designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing extended-release of drugs over time and the physical properties of the polymer-drug matrix can be varied to achieve specified drug loads and release rates.
 We utilize contract manufacturers to produce the drug substances and drug products used in ZILRETTA. Manufacture of PLGA microspheres is a complex process and there are a limited number of contract manufacturing sites with PLGA experience. Our proprietary injectable IA extended-release technology allows us to incorporate pharmaceuticals in PLGA microspheres, such as TA, in the case of ZILRETTA, as well as potentially other product candidates. Following extensive development programs, we have established that a single injection of ZILRETTA sustains local concentrations of TA in the joint for several months. The ZILRETTA microsphere PLGA formulation has gone through numerous iterations and has been optimized to release the drug over an extended period of time. In developing this unique combination of manufacturing process and formulation, we have established numerous trade secrets that relate to precise pharmaceutical release profiles.
 The active pharmaceutical ingredient in ZILRETTA, TA, is manufactured and supplied by Farmabios SpA in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, standards. This supplier is subject to regular inspections by the FDA. The PLGA material used in the manufacture of ZILRETTA is supplied by Evonik Corporation, or Evonik. In November 2016, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Evonik for the purchase of PLGA for clinical and commercial supply of ZILRETTA. The initial term of the Supply Agreement is until July 2021 and will renew for two successive two-year terms upon mutual written consent by both parties.  Under the Supply Agreement, we are bound to purchase PLGA from Evonik at certain minimum purchase amounts, which 
 12


decrease over time, and at a specified price per gram, subject to adjustment from time to time, including due to changes in price indices and in the event the initial term of the Supply Agreement is extended.  Upon termination of the Supply Agreement (other than termination due to the bankruptcy of either Evonik or us) we are obligated to pay the costs associated with the binding supply forecast provided to Evonik. 
 In August 2015, we entered into a Manufacturing Agreement with Patheon U.K. Limited, or Patheon, for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of ZILRETTA finished drug product. In connection with the agreement, Patheon undertook certain technical transfer activities and construction services to prepare its United Kingdom facility for the manufacture of ZILRETTA in dedicated manufacturing suites.  The initial term of our Manufacturing Agreement with Patheon is until October 2027. We may terminate this agreement upon one month’s notice if a regulatory authority causes the withdrawal from, or halts development of, ZILRETTA (in either case for reasons outside our reasonable control) in the United States or any other market that represents 80% of our overall sales. We may also terminate this agreement at any time for convenience by providing 24 months’ notice. Either we or Patheon may terminate this Agreement in the event of (a) an unremedied material breach or bankruptcy of the other party, (b) if a material force majeure event remains uncured for a period of more than 90 days and (c) the granting of a permanent injunction to a third party claiming intellectual property infringement of ZILRETTA in the United States or UK. Upon termination of this agreement, we are obligated to pay for the costs associated with the removal of our manufacturing equipment and for Patheon’s termination costs up to a specified maximum amount.
 Commercial Strategy
 We have established a commercial infrastructure designed to drive the adoption and sales of ZILRETTA with the approximately 10,500 prescribers who treat approximately 70% of patients diagnosed with OA pain of the knee who receive an IA treatment. Of these prescribers, approximately 80% are orthopedists and rheumatologists. We distribute ZILRETTA through a limited network of third-party specialty distributors, a specialty pharmacy, group purchasing organizations and other third parties. While we believe that the United States represents the most attractive market for ZILRETTA, we continue to evaluate opportunities and potential partnerships to develop and commercialize ZILRETTA in territories outside the United States where we believe there is the potential for value-based pricing and reimbursement.
 Of patients who are treated for OA pain of the knee with an IA injection, we estimate that approximately 70% receive IA injections from orthopedic surgeons or their attendant physician extenders (i.e. physician assistants and nurse practitioners). Approximately 8% of patients receive IA injections from physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists and rheumatologists, and approximately 7% of patients are treated by sports medicine specialists. Approximately 10% are treated by primary care physicians. The remaining IA injections are administered by a wider array of health care providers, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners.  
 Competition
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large size and expanding scope of the pain market makes it an attractive therapeutic area for biopharmaceutical businesses. Our potential competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Several of these companies have robust drug pipelines, readily available capital and established research and development organizations. We believe our success will be driven by our ability to develop and commercialize treatment options that make a meaningful difference for patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with OA.  
 The key competitive factors that could affect the success of ZILRETTA’s commercialization are likely to be efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. Immediate-release steroids and HAs are currently the two marketed classes of IA products that compete directly with ZILRETTA. 
 Also available are stem cell and platelet rich plasma, or PRP, injections, but these require on site preparation from tissue or blood taken from the patient, have generated questionable efficacy in controlled clinical trials, and we believe they are unlikely to be a broadly embraced therapeutic option for OA patients. Because these are minimally manipulated autologous therapies, they do not require and have not received FDA review or approval. For that 
 13


reason, they are generally not reimbursed by payers and patients must pay out of pocket to receive these therapies. Furthermore, the American Association of Hip & Knee Surgeons issued a position statement indicating that it cannot recommend biologic therapies, including stem cell and PRP injections, for the treatment of advanced hip or knee arthritis. The American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) and ACR recently issued guidelines strongly recommending against use of IA stem cell therapy and PRP for the treatment of OA.
 In addition to marketed IA medications for OA, other companies have OA product candidates in advanced stages of clinical development. These product candidates include:
  
• | Anika Therapeutics, Inc.’s Cingal®, which is a mixture of Anika’s Monovisc combined with a low dose of a commonly used immediate-release steroid. Anika filed a Pre-Market Application with the FDA for Cingal based on a single pivotal clinical trial. In December 2015, Anika announced that due to the steroid component of the product, it needed to file this product candidate under an NDA. In June 2018, Anika announced Cingal did not achieve statistical significance at the primary endpoint of 26 weeks in an active comparator study. Subsequently, Anika completed an extension study to 39 weeks and announced an intention to include the data in a package for a meeting with the FDA planned for the first quarter of 2019. In February 2019, Anika announced that, based on their discussions with the FDA, they will need to conduct another Phase 3 clinical trial before they can potentially obtain approval for Cingal in the U.S. Anika announced plans to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the full-scale Phase 3 trial design. Anika previously indicated they expect to initiate the pilot study in the first half of 2020.

• | Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Ampion™, which is a derivative of human serum albumin, is described as having anti-inflammatory properties, and is formulated for immediate-release. In 2018, the FDA provided guidance that Ampio should complete an additional Phase 3 trial of KL4 severe OA of the knee patients carried out under Special Protocol Assessment to support a Biologics License Application, or BLA. Ampio previously indicated it expects its Phase 3 trial to be completed in Q1 2020.

• | A number of investigational nerve growth factor antibodies are in development. In January 2019, Pfizer and Lilly announced results from a second Phase 3 study showing that the tanezumab 5 mg treatment arm met all three co-primary endpoints at 24 weeks, demonstrating statistically significant improvement in pain and function compared with those receiving placebo. In contrast, in the 2.5 mg treatment arm, patients’ overall assessment of their OA was not statistically different than placebo. Rapidly progressive OA was seen in 2.1% of tanezumab-treated patients and was not observed in the placebo arm. In December 2019, Pfizer filed a U.S. regulatory submission with the FDA for tanezumab 2.5mg SC in patients with moderate to severe OA. Teva and Regeneron’s fasinumab is in Phase 3 development, with three trials underway, and key data are expected in 2020.

 Intellectual Property/Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
 We are building a broad, worldwide intellectual property portfolio to protect the proprietary position of ZILRETTA, our product candidates and technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure.
Patents and Patent Applications
 We are building a broad, worldwide intellectual property portfolio to protect the proprietary position of ZILRETTA and our product candidates by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We actively apply for, maintain, and plan to defend and enforce, as needed, our internally developed and externally licensed or acquired patent rights. Furthermore, we continue to search for and evaluate opportunities to in-license intellectual property relevant to our business. 
ZILRETTA
 We own three U.S. ZILRETTA patents as well as counterpart foreign patents and patent applications covering composition of matter, methods of manufacture and methods of use. Our U.S. ZILRETTA patents have expiration dates in 2031. The ZILRETTA composition of matter invention is the result of several unique discoveries relating to a narrow drug load specification, a certain release profile of polymers, specific polymer weights and ratios and clinical efficacy observed within a dose-range. The U.S. patents directed to ZILRETTA’s composition of matter and methods of use are listed in the FDA Orange Book. We also have pending U.S. applications directed at compositions of matter similar to ZILRETTA, as well as methods of making and using the same, if resulting in an issued patent, could provide additional related claims expiring in 2031.
 In 2019, we had a patent granted in South Korea, further expanding our global intellectual property portfolio including patents in Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, the Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan and Ukraine. These foreign patents cover the composition of matter, methods of manufacturing and methods of using ZILRETTA and are similar in scope to the protection in the U.S. described above. In addition, we are continuing to prosecute our patent applications pending in Europe and additional countries throughout the world directed to ZILRETTA and related inventions.  
 We have also in-licensed intellectual property, owned by SwRI, which gives us exclusive rights to SwRI patents covering our proprietary microsphere manufacturing technology used in the production of ZILRETTA. These patents are scheduled to expire in 2025.
 FX201 
 In December 2017, we acquired the global rights to FX201 from GeneQuine. As part of the transaction with GeneQuine, we became the direct exclusive licensee of certain foundational patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights owned by Baylor that are related to FX201 for human applications. These patents generally cover 
 15


the composition of matter and method of use of FX201 in the treatment of OA. In June 2019, the U.S. PTO issued patent number 10,301,647, which covers the composition of matter and method of use of FX201 in the treatment of OA with a term through January of 2033. In addition, the Baylor patents related to FX201 are issued in Europe, with an expiry date in 2032, and in Australia, Japan, China and Eurasia with expiry dates in 2033. We are continuing to prosecute the Baylor patent applications related to FX201 which are pending in Canada and India. Further, we have a pending patent application covering effective dosages of FX201 in the treatment of OA in humans, which is expected to provide protection until 2039.
 FX301
 In September 2019, we acquired global rights to develop and commercialize funapide from Xenon, which we have formulated for extended release with our proprietary thermosensitive hydrogel as FX301. As part of the transaction with Xenon, we acquired foundational patents and patent applications covering the composition of matter, methods of use and methods of manufacture related to funapide. We own patents directed to funapide granted in the U.S. as well as Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Mexico and New Zealand with expiry dates in 2030. In addition, we have a pending patent application covering composition of matter, method of use and method of manufacture for FX301, which is expected to provide protection until 2039. 
 Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
 The ZILRETTA microsphere PLGA formulation has been refined and optimized to deliver the drug substance released over an extended period of time. In developing this unique combination of manufacturing process and formulation, we have established numerous trade secrets, including those that relate to a precise pharmaceutical release profile. In addition, due to the complexity of the extended-release technology and the time, costs and technical risks involved in demonstrating bioequivalence through clinical trials, we believe that the ability of manufacturers to gain market approval for generic alternatives to ZILRETTA upon expiration of our patents and FDA exclusivity will be challenging.
 We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees to execute a Proprietary Information, Inventions, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition Agreement upon the commencement of their employment. Consultants and other advisors are required to sign consulting agreements. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.
 Intellectual Property Agreements
 Southwest Research Institute Manufacturing® (SwRI) License
In July 2014, we executed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with SwRI to utilize proprietary microsphere manufacturing technologies for production of our extended-release drug candidates, including ZILRETTA. The SwRI technologies employ a uniquely controlled and continuous atomizing technology that facilitated scale-up of commercial supply. This exclusive agreement provides for an expanded field of use in a variety of musculoskeletal disorders, as well as broader polymer and steroid ranges, which offers the flexibility to potentially explore different doses, disease indications, and drug-PLGA combinations. We have no further payment obligations following the amendment executed by the parties in February 2017 and the license remains in effect through patent term expiry. 
FX201 Related Agreements
 In December 2017, we acquired the global rights to develop and commercialize FX201. As part of the asset purchase transaction with GeneQuine, we made an upfront payment of $2.0 million.  In 2018, we paid GeneQuine a $750,000 milestone payment for initiating a GLP toxicology study of FX201. In addition, we paid GeneQuine a 
 16


$750,000 payment in November 2019 following the FDA acceptance of the IND application for FX201. This milestone was recognized as research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2019. The next milestone of $2.5 million was achieved in March 2020 when the first patient was treated in the Phase 1 clinical trial.  We may also be required to make additional milestone payments during the development of FX201, including up to $4.5 million through the Phase 2 proof of concept, or PoC, clinical trial and, following successful PoC, up to an additional $51.5 million in development and global regulatory approval milestone payments.  As part of the transaction with GeneQuine, we became the direct licensee of certain underlying Baylor patents and other proprietary rights related to FX201 for human applications.  The Baylor license agreement grants us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide right and license (with a right to sublicense) for human applications under its patent and other proprietary rights directly related to FX201, with a similar non-exclusive license to certain Baylor intellectual property rights that are not specific to FX201.  The license agreement with Baylor includes a low single-digit royalty on net sales of FX201 and requires us to use reasonable efforts to develop FX201 according to timelines set out in the license agreement.  In December 2017, we also entered into a Master Production Services Agreement with SAFC Carlsbad, Inc., a part of MilliporeSigma, for the manufacturing of preclinical and initial clinical supplies of FX201. In addition, we recently entered into a manufacturing agreement that secures clinical trial supply of FX201 through Phase 3 clinical trials.  

FX301 Related Agreements
 In September 2019, we acquired from Xenon, global rights to develop and commercialize funapide formulated for extended release with our novel, proprietary thermosensitive hydrogel under our preclinical program known as FX301.. As part of the asset purchase transaction with Xenon, we made an upfront payment to Xenon of $3.0 million.  We may also be required to make additional milestone payments during the development of FX301, including up to $9.0 million through initiation of a Phase 2 proof of concept (PoC) clinical trial and, following successful PoC, up to $40.8 million in development and global regulatory approval milestone payments and up to an additional $75.0 million in sales-related milestone payments. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as it did not qualify as a business combination.  The upfront fee was attributed to the intellectual property acquired and recognized as research and development expense in September 2019 as the FX301 product candidate had not been commercially approved and had no alternative future use. Future milestone payments earned prior to regulatory approval of FX301 will be recognized as research and development expense in the period when the milestone events become probable of being achieved. Future milestones earned subsequent to regulatory approval will be recognized as an intangible asset and amortized to expense over the estimated life of FX301. As of December 31, 2019, no milestones under the arrangement had been achieved. As part of the transaction, we became the direct licensee of certain underlying Xenon patents and other proprietary rights related to funapide for human applications.  The Xenon agreement grants us an exclusive, royalty-bearing, world-wide right and license (with a right to sublicense) for human applications under its patents directly related to funapide, with a similar royalty-free license to other Xenon proprietary rights directly related to funapide. The agreement with Xenon includes a tiered royalty ranging from mid-single digits to low double digits that is based on aggregate annual net sales of FX301 and requires us to use reasonable efforts to develop FX301 according to timelines set out in the agreement.  
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing and commercializing. 
 17


U.S. Biopharmaceutical Product Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biopharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Biopharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of human clinical studies, collectively referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and according to the International Council for Harmonization, or ICH, GCP guidelines, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biopharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a proposed new drug product or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for a biological product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biopharmaceutical product is produced and tested to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biopharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval or licensure of the NDA or BLA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the biopharmaceutical product candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage, also referred to as preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the biopharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP.  The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other documentation, to the FDA as part of the IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biopharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biopharmaceutical product candidate to healthy subjects or patients with the target disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the 
 18


parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s regulations which reflect the ICH GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed.
 Clinical trials for biopharmaceutical product candidates are typically conducted in humans in three sequential phases that may overlap.  In Phase 1 clinical trials, the biopharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety or adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology.  In Phase 2 clinical trials, the biopharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the biopharmaceutical product for specific targeted indications and determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease.  Once a biopharmaceutical product shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes.  In Phase 3 clinical trials, the biopharmaceutical product is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the biopharmaceutical product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the biopharmaceutical product and to provide adequate information for its labeling.
 Post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
 Progress reports detailing the status of biopharmaceutical product development and results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects or patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board (if applicable) may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biopharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to study subjects.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biopharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the biopharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biopharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biopharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 FDA Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies for claimed indications as well as descriptions of the manufacturing process and controls, analytical tests conducted on the biopharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. A supplement to an approved NDA or BLA is also required to be submitted for review when seeking major changes to manufacturing or labeling, including additional indications for use. Additionally, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and the support for dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, are contained in an NDA or BLA. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers after the initial submission of a pediatric study plan following an end of Phase 2 meeting unless otherwise agreed upon by the FDA and the sponsor. The submission of an NDA or 
 19


BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the application for filing. Once the application is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months after submission for a new molecular entity in which to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review application. In addition, the FDA has 10 months after submission of an NDA for a non-new molecular entity in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of standard and priority review applications. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three-month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle.
 The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biopharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biopharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. When an inspection is undertaken, the FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations regarding conduct of clinical trials for the product’s trials. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in a complete response letter to the applicant and often will request additional testing or information.
 If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or REMS to assure safe use of the product through distribution or other controls. In addition, the FDA may require post approval studies, referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated 
 20


corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a consent decree of permanent injunction, which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. 
 The FDA and other federal and state agencies closely regulate the promotion of drugs. Moreover, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about drug and biologic products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for off label uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product’s approved packaging label or are otherwise truthful and not misleading statements. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
 Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling changes, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biopharmaceutical product for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers.
 In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state government payer programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the third-party payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. In addition, our biopharmaceutical products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
 A third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not ensure that other payers also will provide coverage or an adequate reimbursement rate for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer scrutiny. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue experiencing pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and 
 21


efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and on prescription drugs in particular, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any company.
 Additionally, in order to be eligible for certain federal agencies and grantees to purchase ZILRETTA, or to have it paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs, we participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. We are obligated through the FSS program to sell ZILRETTA through a FSS contract and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price, or FCP, to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard). The FCP is based on the non-federal Average Manufacturer Price, which we will need to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. These obligations contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements.  
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs, improve healthcare quality or expand access to healthcare.
 In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The MMA expanded Medicare coverage to include outpatient prescription drug purchases made by the elderly by establishing Medicare Part D and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician administered drugs under Medicare Part B. In addition, the MMA provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that would be covered in any therapeutic class under the Medicare Part D program. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we receive for ZILRETTA and any of our other approved products. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively PPACA, was enacted as a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the 
 22


health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of PPACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are the following:
  
• | an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new requirements under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of PPACA, and its implementing regulations, that manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made or distributed to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, and that applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an FDA-approval framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of PPACA.  Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, signed into law on December 22, 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by PPACA on certain individuals that fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all of part of a year commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, the 2020 federal spending 
 23


package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax.  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act.  Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well.  It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace PPACA will impact PPACA. 
 In addition, since the PPACA was enacted, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted that may impact the extent to which we are able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. For example, in August 2011, then-President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, two percent per fiscal year through 2029 unless Congress takes additional action. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices, including at the federal level several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and legislation designed to, among other things, increase drug pricing transparency, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, review relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program drug reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these, and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize ZILRETTA and any future products for which we receive regulatory approval.
 We expect that PPACA reform, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, as well as additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, including ZILRETTA.

Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create the regenerative medicine advanced therapies, or RMAT, designation. The RMAT designation is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. RMAT covers cell therapies, gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a regenerative medicine advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the criteria are met, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of clinical trial sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, various activities, including but not limited to sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, each as amended. Failure to comply with such requirements could potentially result in substantial penalties to us. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in pharmaceutical companies in the United States, and some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of business, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of a good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid program. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. 
 Federal false claims and false statements laws, including the federal False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for items or services, including drugs, for payment to, or approval by, a federal healthcare program, including Medicare or Medicaid. The qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, 
 25


concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, impose requirements on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
 Where our activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.  
 If we seek to have a product covered in the United States by the Medicaid programs, various obligations, including government price reporting, are required under the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended, which generally require products to be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to such programs and certain purchasers. In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Many of our current as well as possible future activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We must also comply with laws that require clinical trial registration and reporting of clinical trial results on the publicly available clinical trial databank maintained by the National Institutes of Health at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. If the new drug is a new chemical entity subject to an NDA, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our future products.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
