--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During periods prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the Company also operated through a fifth reportable segment, Home Services Operations, comprised of former subsidiary Specialty Contracting Group, LLC’s operation of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona. However, for the year ended December 31, 2021, and for all prior periods presented, Home Services Operations are reported as discontinued operations.
 
The management of the Company also continually reviews various business opportunities for the Company, including those in other lines of business.
 
Asset Management Operations
 
The Company operates its asset management operations business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC (“Willow Oak”) and Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC.
 
Willow Oak is an asset management platform focused on growing and enhancing the alternative investment landscape. Willow Oak seeks partnerships with alternative investment managers in the early stages of growth in order to build a network of unique investment opportunities for investors and scalable, professional operations for managers. Willow Oak offers affiliated managers strategic consulting, operational support, and growth opportunities through minority partnerships and other bespoke relationships. Affiliations to date include fund reinvestments, fund launching, investor relations, and fund management administrative support. The Company intends to actively expand its Willow Oak platform with additional offerings that enhance the value of the Willow Oak platform to managers and funds across the investing community. 
 
On August 21, 2020, Willow Oak created two wholly-owned entities, Willow Oak Asset Management Affiliate Management Services, LLC (“Willow Oak AMS”) and Willow Oak Asset Management Fund Management Services, LLC (“Willow Oak FMS”), to support this partnership model in perpetuity. Willow Oak AMS earns gross revenue shares commensurate with ownership stakes in investment management firms in exchange for the provision of benefits of affiliation and ongoing fund management services (“FMS”). Willow Oak FMS earns a direct fee from affiliated limited partnerships for rendering administrative, compliance program management, and tax and audit liaison services. 
 
Real Estate Operations
 
As has been previously reported, in December 2017, ENDI created a wholly-owned subsidiary named Mt Melrose, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“New Mt Melrose”), to acquire a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into in December 2017 with a like-named seller, Mt. Melrose, LLC (“Old Mt. Melrose”), a Kentucky limited liability company owned by Jeff Moore, then an ENDI director. During January and June 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed two bundled acquisitions from Old Mt. Melrose of residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. As has been previously reported, on June 27, 2019, the Company sold 65% of its membership interest in New Mt Melrose to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser, Woodmont Lexington, LLC (“Woodmont”). As consideration for the transaction, Woodmont paid the Company $100,000 and agreed to assume full responsibility for the management and operation of New Mt Melrose and its real estate portfolio. As a result of no longer having a controlling financial interest, the Company deconsolidated the operations of New Mt Melrose as of June 27, 2019. As was previously reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 20, 2021, on May 17, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Woodmont that terminated and effected a sale to Woodmont of the Company’s remaining membership interests in New Mt Melrose in conjunction with a cash payment to the Company. As of the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021, and subsequently the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company does not hold any remaining interests in the New Mt Melrose entity. See Notes 4 and 11 for more information.
 
Our other real estate operations include activity from a legacy real estate investment portfolio held through EDI Real Estate, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary. The portfolio, primarily located in the Roanoke area of Virginia, includes a residential rental property and vacant land. The residential property is a single-family home that is currently rented and managed through a third-party property manager.
 
Internet Operations
 
The Company operates its internet operations segment through Sitestar.net, a wholly-owned subsidiary that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services, web hosting, third-party software as a reseller, and various ancillary services. Sitestar.net provides services to customers in the United States and Canada.

Other Operations
 
Other operations include nonrecurring or one-time strategic funding or similar activity that are not considered to be one of the Company’s primary lines of business. This activity includes opportunities such as the Company’s financing arrangement regarding Triad Guaranty, Inc.
 
Other operations also include any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations, as well as expenses related to public company reporting, the oversight of subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company.
Discontinued Operations - Home Services Operations
 
Prior to May 24, 2019, the Company operated its home services operations segment through its subsidiary, Specialty Contracting Group, LLC (formerly known as HVAC Value Fund, LLC). The Company had organized and launched this subsidiary in June 2016, initially with an unaffiliated third party. Specialty Contracting Group was focused on the management of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona.
 
As has been previously reported, in May 2019, the Company, via Specialty Contracting Group, completed a divestiture of the home services operations to an unaffiliated third-parity purchaser, Rooter Hero Plumbing, Inc. (“Rooter Hero”).

Asset Management Operations
 
The Company operates its asset management operations business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC (“Willow Oak”), Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC, Willow Oak Asset Management Affiliate Management Services, LLC (“Willow Oak AMS”), and Willow Oak Asset Management Fund Management Services, LLC (“Willow Oak FMS”).
 
In 2016, the Company made a seed investment, through Willow Oak, to assist in the launch of Alluvial Fund, LP, a private investment fund that was launched on January 1, 2017, by an unaffiliated sponsor and general partner, Alluvial Capital Management, LLC. The Company had determined that Willow Oak’s support of Alluvial Capital Management, LLC and its direct investment in Alluvial Fund were both beneficial and necessary undertakings in conjunction with establishing an asset management operations business and gaining credibility within that industry. As a special limited partner, Willow Oak earned a share of management and performance fees earned. On May 31, 2021, however, Willow Oak initiated a series of liquidating distributions of its investment in Alluvial Fund according to a mutually agreed upon cash distribution schedule with the general partner. On December 31, 2021, Willow Oak initiated its third and final liquidating cash distribution totaling $3,734,465 in respect of such withdrawal. This brings the total cash distribution amount to $17,772,369 for the year ended December 31, 2021. In accordance with the partnership terms of Alluvial Fund, a portion of Willow Oak’s capital account will be retained by the general partner until the fund’s activities for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been finalized through an independent audit. The retained amount will not be actively invested and will not be subject to investment gains or losses. The retained amount is represented by the investment redemption receivable amount on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Investment gains and losses for activity during the year ended December 31, 2021, and for prior periods presented, are reported as revenue on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021, Willow Oak no longer holds any remaining investment in Alluvial Fund.
 
In furtherance of establishing the asset management operations business, Willow Oak signed a fee share agreement in June 2017, with Coolidge Capital Management, LLC (“Coolidge”), whose sole member is Keith D. Smith, an ENDI director. Willow Oak is the sole member of Bonhoeffer Capital Management, LLC, the general partner to Bonhoeffer Fund, LP, a private investment partnership launched by Willow Oak and managed by Coolidge. Under their agreement concerning Bonhoeffer Fund, LP, Willow Oak paid all start-up expenses and pays agreed-upon operating expenses that are not partnership expenses, Coolidge is responsible for all investment management, and Willow Oak receives 50% of all performance and management fees earned. Additionally, Willow Oak FMS earns a direct fee from the private limited partnership for the administrative, compliance program management, and tax and audit liaison services it renders.
 
On November 1, 2018, Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC entered into a fund management services agreement with Arquitos Investment Manager, LP, Arquitos Capital Management, LLC, and Arquitos Capital Offshore Master, Ltd. (collectively “Arquitos”), which are managed by our Board chairman and principal executive officer, Steven L. Kiel, to provide Arquitos with Willow Oak’s Fund Management Services (“FMS”) consisting of the following services: strategic planning, investor relations, marketing, operations, compliance program management and legal coordination, accounting and bookkeeping, annual audit and tax coordination, and liaison to third-party service providers. Willow Oak earns monthly and annual fees as consideration for these services. On November 1, 2020, this arrangement was renewed with revised terms that include an exchange of services between Willow Oak and Arquitos. Steven Kiel, through Arquitos, has been contracted to perform ongoing consulting services for the benefit of Willow Oak in the following areas: strategic development, marketing, networking and fundraising. In exchange, Willow Oak continues to provide ongoing FMS services. Willow Oak continues to earn monthly and annual fees as consideration for these services.
 
On October 1, 2019, Willow Oak partnered with Geoff Gannon and Andrew Kuhn to form Focused Compounding Capital Management, LLC (“Focused Compounding”). This joint venture, of which Willow Oak Capital Management is a 10% beneficial owner, manages capital through separately managed accounts and a private investment fund launched January 1, 2020. Willow Oak provides ongoing FMS and operational support in addition to having covered all one-time expenses associated with the launch of Focused Compounding Fund, LP. As consideration for the arrangement, Willow Oak Capital Management is entitled to 10% of gross management and performance fees earned by Focused Compounding. Additionally, Willow Oak FMS earns a direct fee from the private limited partnership for the administrative, compliance program management, and tax and audit liaison services it renders.
 
On September 29, 2020, Willow Oak, through Willow Oak AMS, executed a strategic relationship agreement with SVN Capital, LLC whereby Willow Oak would receive certain economic and other rights in exchange for the provision of certain ongoing FMS and operational services offered through Willow Oak FMS. Pursuant to these economic rights, Willow Oak is entitled to 20% of gross management and performance fees earned by the firm. Additionally, Willow Oak FMS earns a direct fee from SVN Capital Fund, LP, a private investment fund launched by the firm’s managing member, for the administrative, compliance program management, and tax and audit liaison services it renders.

Real Estate Operations
 
As has been previously reported, in December 2017, ENDI created New Mt Melrose, a wholly-owned subsidiary at that time, to acquire a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into in December 2017 with the seller, Old Mt. Melrose. During January and June 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed two bundled acquisitions from Old Mt. Melrose of residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. As has been previously reported, on June 27, 2019, the Company sold 65% of its membership interest in New Mt Melrose to Woodmont, which agreed to assume full responsibility for the management and operation of New Mt Melrose and its real estate portfolio. As a result of no longer having a controlling financial interest, the Company deconsolidated the operations of New Mt Melrose as of June 27, 2019. As was previously reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 20, 2021, on May 17, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Woodmont that terminated and effected a sale to Woodmont of the Company’s remaining membership interests in New Mt Melrose in conjunction with a cash payment to the Company. As of the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021, and subsequently the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company does not hold any remaining interests in the New Mt Melrose entity. See Notes 4 and 11 for more information.
 
As has been previously reported, in July 2017, ENDI created a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary named EDI Real Estate, LLC, to hold ENDI’s legacy portfolio of real estate. As of December 31, 2021, through EDI Real Estate, LLC, ENDI owns a legacy real estate investment portfolio that includes one residential property and vacant land. Our real estate portfolio under EDI Real Estate, LLC is primarily located in Roanoke, Virginia. The portfolio includes an occupied single-family home that is managed by a third-party property management company. The lease in effect as of December 31, 2021, is based on a month-to-month provision, as the initial annual term of the lease has been completed. An outside property management company manages this rental property on behalf of the Company.
 
State and municipal laws and regulations govern the real estate industry in general and do not vary significantly throughout our real estate holding areas. State laws, including the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, in addition to local ordinances, govern our rental property and also do not vary significantly throughout our real estate holding areas.
 
Internet Operations
 
The Company operates its internet operations segment through Sitestar.net, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Sitestar.net is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services, web hosting, third-party software as a reseller, and various ancillary services. We provide services to customers in the United States and Canada. This segment markets and sells narrow-band (dial-up and ISDN) and broadband services (DSL, fiber-optic, and wireless), as well as web hosting and related services to consumers and businesses.
 
Our primary competitors include regional and national cable and telecommunications companies that have substantially greater market presence, brand-name recognition, and financial resources compared to Sitestar.net. Secondary competitors include local and regional ISPs.
 
The residential broadband internet access market is dominated by cable and telecommunications companies. These companies offer internet connectivity through the use of cable modems, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) programs, and fiber. These competitors have extensive scale and significantly more resources than Sitestar.net. Competitors often offer incentives for customers to purchase internet access by offering discounts for bundled service offerings (i.e., phone, television, and Internet). While we are a reseller of broadband services including DSL and fiber services, our profit margin is heavily influenced by these competitive forces.
 
There are currently laws and regulations directly applicable to access or commerce on the internet, covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, information security, and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with Internet communications. We may be positively or negatively affected by the repeal, modification, or adoption of various laws and regulations. These changes may occur at the international, federal, state, and local levels, and may cover a wide range of issues.
 
As of December 31, 2021, the focus of our internet operations segment is to generate cash flow, work to make our costs variable, and reinvest in our operations when an acceptable return is available. We did not make significant reinvestments into the internet operations segment during the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Management routinely endeavors to identify the market value for domain names owned by the Company in order to assess potential income opportunities. Management evaluates these domain names for third-party sales potential, as well as for other marketing opportunities that could generate new revenue from current customers who utilize the domains.
 
Other Operations
 
Other operations include nonrecurring or one-time strategic funding or similar activity and other corporate operations that are not considered to be one of the Company’s primary lines of business. Below are the main recent activities comprising other operations.
Financing Arrangement Regarding Triad Guaranty, Inc.
 
In August 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with several independent third parties to provide debtor-in-possession financing to an unaffiliated third party, Triad Guaranty, Inc., through Triad DIP Investors, LLC. The Company initially contributed $100,000. Triad Guaranty, Inc. exited bankruptcy in April 2018, and the Company subsequently entered into an amended and restated promissory note. As part of the amended and restated promissory note, the Company provided an additional contribution in the amount of $55,000 in May 2018. The terms of the promissory note provided for interest in the amount of 10% annually and the issuance of warrants in Triad Guaranty, Inc. equal to 2.5% of the company. On December 31, 2020, the Company accepted a revision of terms to the original promissory note, which includes, among other things, an extension of the loan maturity date to December 31, 2022, an increase of interest to the amount of 12% annually, and a provision to settle all currently accrued interest through the issuance of Triad Guaranty, Inc. common shares. In line with the revision of note terms, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, the Company was issued 454,097 shares of Triad Guaranty, Inc. in lieu of interest accrued on the note receivable as of December 31, 2020.
 
On December 27, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of a comparable investment consisting of (i) another Triad Guaranty, Inc. promissory note in the original principal sum of $155,000, having the same terms as the December 31, 2020, financing agreement, along with (ii) 393,750 common shares of Triad Guaranty, Inc., for $25,000 from a related party. The value of this purchase is reflective of the implied collectability of the promissory note and the relative illiquidity of Triad Guaranty, Inc. stock. The Company determined that the December 27, 2021, transaction represents an active market transaction of similar assets to the Company’s existing Triad Guaranty, Inc. assets. As a result, the Company recorded a total $189,515 impairment on December 31, 2021, to its existing Triad Guaranty, Inc. promissory note and common stock to reflect the market value implied by the December 27, 2021, transaction. As of December 31, 2021, the Company holds its interests in both promissory notes for $50,000 under notes receivable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and has attributed no value to its 847,847 aggregate shares of Triad Guaranty, Inc. common stock. See Note 6 for more information.
 
Corporate Operations
 
Corporate operations include any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations, as well as expenses related to public company reporting, the oversight of subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company.

Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed six full-time individuals through the asset management, real estate, internet, and other operations segments. We also utilize outside contractors as necessary to assist with consulting, technical support, and customer service. Our employees are not unionized, and we consider relations with employees to be favorable.
 
Proposed Merger with CBA
 
As previously announced on December 29, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with ENDI Corp., a Delaware corporation (“ENDI”), Zelda Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“First Merger Sub”), Zelda Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Second Merger Sub”), CrossingBridge Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“CrossingBridge”), and Cohanzick Management, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“Cohanzick” and, together with the Company, ENDI, First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub and CrossingBridge, the “Parties”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company will merge with First Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ENDI, with the Company being the surviving entity (the “First Merger”), and CrossingBridge will merge with Second Merger Sub, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of ENDI, with CrossingBridge being the surviving entity (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, each share of common stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive one (1) share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of ENDI (the “Class A Common Shares”), and Cohanzick, as the sole member of CrossingBridge, will receive 2,400,000 Class A Common Shares and 1,800,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of ENDI (the “Class B Common Shares”, and together with the Class A Common Shares, the “Common Shares”), a Class W-1 Warrant to purchase 1,800,000 Class A Common Shares and a Class W-2 Warrant to purchase 250,000 Class A Common Shares. The Class A Common Shares and Class B Common Shares are identical other than the Class B Common Shares have the right to designate directors (as described below) and that the Class B Common Shares shall not be entitled to participate in dividends or other distributions with respect to the Class A Common Shares and shall not receive any assets of ENDI in the event of a liquidation. The warrant to purchase 1,800,000 Class A Common Shares and the warrant to purchase 250,000 Class A Common Shares to be issued to Cohanzick may be exercised in whole or in part at any time prior to the date that is five (5) years after the date of the Merger closing, at an exercise price of $8.00 per Class A Common Share subject to certain customary adjustments. Each of the warrants may also be exercised on a “cashless” basis at any time at the election of the holder and if not fully exercised prior to the expiration date of the warrant, shall be automatically exercised on a “cashless” basis. In addition, Cohanzick or its designee has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 Class A Common Shares, and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an additional 250,000 Class A Common Shares (collectively the “Additional Shares”), not later than five (5) business days following the consummation of the Merger at a price equal to the lesser of $8.00 or the 60 day volume weighted average price of Enterprise Diversified’s common shares as of the Merger closing date (the “Closing”), excluding the highest and lowest trading days. Certain of our officers, directors and employees shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to a further 55,000 Class A Common Shares on the same terms as the purchase of the Additional Shares. During the year ended December 31, 2021, ENDI incurred $1,148,971 of transaction costs directly associated with due diligence, public reporting, and legal advice associated with the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been approved by our board of directors and by the board of managers of Cohanzick and remains subject to the approval of our stockholders. Holders of our common shares shall have dissenters’ rights as provided by Section 92A of the Nevada Revised Statutes. The Company and ENDI have filed a draft registration statement on Form S-4, including a prospectus registering the issuance of the ENDI Class A Common Shares, Class B Common Shares, Warrants and Class A Common Shares underlying the Warrants and draft proxy statement of the Company relating to the meeting of stockholders of the Company to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. Further, as discussed in more detail below, certain of the Company’s stockholders have entered into voting and support agreements pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of capital stock of the Company in favor of the Merger.
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the Company, CrossingBridge, ENDI, Cohanzick and the merger subsidiaries, and certain of the parties to the Merger Agreement have agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to: (1) the conduct of their respective businesses during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger; (2) the use of reasonable best efforts to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals; and (3) obligations of the Company to convene a meeting of its stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.
 
Completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among others, (1) approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, by our stockholders, (2) the draft registration statement on Form S-4 being declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), (3) the quotation of ENDI’s Class A Common Shares on the OTC Market, (4) the absence of any law, order or regulatory ruling prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and (5) the truth of each party’s representations and warranties, and the performance of each party’s covenants.
 
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights including upon: (1) the mutual written agreement of the Company and CrossingBridge to terminate the Merger Agreement, (2) the written notice of either the Company or CrossingBridge if the Merger has not closed by June 30, 2022, (3) a material breach of the Merger Agreement by us or CrossingBridge, which breach cannot be cured within thirty (30) days, (4) the failure to obtain any required regulatory or governmental approvals, (5) the failure to obtain the approval of the Company’s stockholders, or (6) the failure of our board of directors to make, or the withdrawal, amendment or qualification, in a manner adverse to CrossingBridge, of a recommendation in favor of the merger, or the failure of our board to include its recommendation in the proxy statement or the recommendation by the board of an alternative proposal or similar actions. In the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to clause (6) of the preceding sentence, we shall pay a fee in the amount of $1,000,000 to CrossingBridge.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, ENDI has agreed that at the Closing, it will enter into a registration rights agreement with certain stockholders of ENDI following the Closing that are deemed to be affiliates of ENDI immediately following the Closing, under which such stockholders’ Class A Common Shares, including the Class A Common Shares underlying any warrants issued in connection with the Merger, will be registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, ENDI has agreed that at the Closing, it will amend and restate its certificate of incorporation to provide for, among other things, the rights of the holders of the Class B Common Shares to designate certain members of ENDI’s board of directors.
 
The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ENDI will provide that so long as the holders of Class B Common Shares and their affiliates own at least 25% of the outstanding Common Shares, the holders of Class B Common Shares shall have the right to designate 60% of the authorized number of directors on ENDI’s board of directors (rounded up or down to the nearest whole number as necessary in light of the actual number of members of the board of directors). So long as the holders of Class B Common Shares and their affiliates own at least 15% but less than 25% of the outstanding Common Shares, the holders of Class B Common Shares shall have the right to designate 40% of the authorized number of directors on ENDI’s board of directors (rounded up or down to the nearest whole number as necessary in light of the actual number of members of the board of directors). So long as the holders of Class B Common Shares and their affiliates own at least 5% but less than 15% of the outstanding Common Shares, the holders of Class B Common Shares shall have the right to designate one (1) director on ENDI’s board of directors. At the closing, the Class B Common Shares shall be entitled to designate 3 of the 5 members of ENDI’s board of directors.
 
ENDI has also agreed at the Closing, it will enter into a stockholder agreement and separate voting agreement with Cohanzick and certain stockholders of ENDI pursuant to which, among other provisions, from and after the date that the holders of Class B Common Shares are no longer entitled to elect at least one (1) director to ENDI’s board of directors pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation as described above, so long as David Sherman and his affiliates, who will collectively beneficially own approximately 61.3% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of ENDI immediately following the Merger (assuming the Additional Shares are not issued), beneficially own at least 25% of the outstanding Common Shares, will have the right to nominate up to 60% of the authorized number of directors on the ENDI board, and the stockholders named therein have agreed to vote in support of such director nominees. David Sherman is the controlling member of Cohanzick and together with his affiliates has an economic interest of approximately 87% of Cohanzick. The number of directors David Sherman and his affiliates are permitted to nominate to ENDI’s board of directors decreases to 40% if David Sherman and his affiliates cease to beneficially own less than 25% but at least 15% of the outstanding Common Shares. So long as David Sherman and his affiliates own at least 5% but less than 15% of the outstanding Common Shares, David Sherman and his affiliates shall have the right to nominate one (1) director.

Voting and Support Agreement
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement we and certain of our stockholders holding an aggregate of approximately 34% of the issued and outstanding voting capital stock of the Company have entered into a voting and support agreement (the “Support Agreement”) pursuant to which such stockholders of the Company have agreed to vote their shares of capital stock of the Company in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and against any action, agreement, transaction or proposal that would result in a breach of any covenant or other provision of the Merger Agreement or that would reasonably be expected to result in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement from not being completed. Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the stockholders party thereto have also agreed to waive their dissenters rights under Nevada law with respect to the Merger, not to solicit or support any corporate transaction that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to constitute, an alternative to the Merger, and not to sell, transfer, assign or otherwise take any action that would have the effect of preventing or disabling the stockholder from voting its shares of the Company in accordance with its obligations under the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement automatically terminates upon the termination of the Merger Agreement or upon the mutual agreement of the parties to the Support Agreement. The Support Agreement is included as Exhibit 2.2 to this annual report. The description of the Support Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the content of the Support Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.2.
 
Because of the material conditions to closing, including the approval of our stockholders of the Merger Agreement, we cannot assure you that the Merger will close as scheduled or at all, or on the terms described herein.
