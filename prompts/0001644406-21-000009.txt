Item 1. Business
Hostess - Who We Are
We are a leading packaged food company focused on developing, manufacturing, selling and distributing snack products in North America. We produce a variety of new and classic treats including Hostess® CupCakes, Twinkies®, Donettes®, Ding Dongs®, and Zingers®, Danishes, Honey Buns and Coffee Cakes, as well as Voortman® branded cookies, wafer and sugar-free products. Our strategic vision is to be an iconic snack company that builds brands and categories to delight our consumers and customers. We seek to leverage our differentiated core competencies of strong brand equity, continuous innovation, efficient manufacturing and distribution model, collaborative customer partnerships, and significant cash flows to drive profitable and sustainable growth by engaging consumers with our products while seeking opportunities in adjacent snacking categories. 
We operate in the growing snacking market where indulgent, sweet snacking continues to be a top preference for consumers1. Our Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) products represented 19.5% of their category according to Nielsen total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2020. Our cookie and wafer products provide a significant opportunity to grow in the adjacent cookie category. We believe our strong brand history and market position in the categories in which we compete, combined with our innovative spirit and scalable operating model, provide a strong platform to execute our strategic initiatives. 
We have invested significantly in retailer and consumer data analytics to identify distribution and pricing opportunities and in automated baking and packaging lines to enhance production efficiencies. These investments, combined with our Direct-to-Warehouse (“DTW”) distribution model, support our leading brand position within the $6.9 billion U.S. SBG category and have increased our distribution channels, paving a path towards future sustainable, profitable growth.
Our DTW distribution model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers to fill orders, with products generally delivered to our customers’ warehouses. This model has eliminated the need for direct-store-delivery (“DSD”) routes and drivers, which allows us to expand our core distribution while gaining access to new channels. During 2020, we successfully transitioned the distribution of Voortman® products, which were acquired as part of our acquisition of Voortman Cookies Limited, from a DSD model to our DTW distribution network. This transition created significant cost savings and unlocked opportunities to penetrate the convenience, drug store and dollar channels.
Brands and Products
Hostess® has been an iconic American brand for generations. Our extensive portfolio of timeless and universally recognized names such as Twinkies®, HoHos® and Ding Dongs® evoke an emotional affinity with consumers that has the potential to be further unlocked through effective marketing and consumer-insight based innovation. We also produce Voortman®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill® and Big Texas® branded products. Each brand targets different markets and consumer needs.

COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to stem its spread have caused significant economic disruption. We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic and adjust our operations in response. As discussed further below, as well as in “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7, we have taken action to respond to these disruptions to protect the health and well-being of our entire team, their families and the communities we serve.
Our Growth Strategy
We are executing our growth strategy by strengthening our core Hostess® brand and expanding into adjacent categories through innovation and strong partnerships with our customers, leveraging our highly efficient and profitable business model and executing strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth, while effectively managing our capital structure.
Optimize the core Hostess® brand and expand into adjacent categories 
We believe that we have maintained the Hostess® brand power and category awareness for over a century by satisfying consumers’ need for great-tasting sweet treats. We have established our leadership position in the SBG category through the strength and quality of our products, developing and promoting brands which unite our loyal consumer base and by pricing our products at a reasonable premium to other snacking alternatives. Our acquisition of Voortman, another premium brand with a reputation for quality, enables us to leverage production capabilities and brand recognition to gain market share in the adjacent category. 
We plan to capitalize on the strength of our brands and our effective retailer economics to drive growth by attracting new consumers and increasing the number of stores carrying our products. With the potential of extended reach under our DTW distribution model, our market share gains are expected to come from traditional channels (“core expansion”) through our investment in quality, targeted marketing, product innovation and a focus on our most effective brands and products. Our brand strategy, combined with investments in highly effective marketing and brand-building, has resulted in what we believe to be one of the strongest brand equities in snacking, evidenced by our 90% brand awareness for Hostess®2.
Innovation is key to fueling our growth. We are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing them in order to stay relevant with our consumer base and attract new consumers. We believe that to support our market position, we must continually evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends. We are focused on continuing to innovate and expand our core products by launching new flavors of iconic products and expanding new product forms, pack-sizes and packaging to leverage the brand’s power and drive incremental revenue and profit. The success of our product innovation is in part driven by understanding consumer preferences, providing awareness and trials by partnering with our customers, all while maintaining our iconic brands and product quality. 
2 AYTM Awareness Study, July 2020
The addition of the Voortman® brand provides us opportunities to respond to additional consumer preferences. In 2021, our new Super Grains cookies will be introduced. We believe these cookies satisfy the consumer need for a baked indulgence with wholesome ingredients. Our new Crispy Minis products were introduced in late 2020 and leverage Voortman's production capacities, extending the Hostess® brand into a new bite-size wafer form.
We are driving incremental growth in the Hostess® brand through extensions of our core products and limited time offerings. Fun seasonal items such as Valentine Ding Dongs® and Mint Chocolate Twinkies®, and Key Lime and S'mores flavored CupCakes, continue to engage our target consumers and provide a fresh perspective to the brand.
During 2020, growth in the breakfast sub-category outpaced total sweet baked goods growth, as more consumers chose sweets in the morning. This consumption trend plays to our strengths as our products conveniently come packaged in both single-serve and multipack varieties. We believe our breakfast portfolio, which includes Hostess® Donettes®, Coffee Cakes, Cinnamon Rolls and Danishes as well as new product forms planned for 2021, including Baby Bundts, Pecan Spins and Muff'n Stix, meet the consumer demand for on-the-go sweet snacking.
We continue to launch new partnerships and enter into licensing agreements that leverage our iconic brands. We have partnered with companies in various industries to bring our iconic brands and flavor profiles to products ranging from flavored coffees and creamers to protein powders and dessert mixes. Outside of the United States, our products are sold throughout Canada and are also distributed by third parties internationally, including products packaged specifically for Mexico and the United Kingdom, among others. In addition, our products are also sold on various e-commerce platforms.
We understand the need to continually evolve while maintaining the traditional offerings our loyal consumer base has come to know and love. We continue to invest in new product development and building our long-term pipeline, leveraging our innovation portfolio and commercialization process to bring new products to market in a timely fashion. 
Leverage highly efficient and profitable business model
When we relaunched the Company, we set out to disrupt the status quo business model of the SBG category. We established our innovative DTW distribution model and heavily invested in our bakeries, which has resulted in energy, labor and time savings, along with the ability to produce quality products. These investments also paved the way for new product innovation. 
The DTW model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers. We ship the majority of our products from a centralized distribution center in Edgerton, Kansas. This centralization improves visibility and control of distribution and is a key component of our operating model. We utilize other smaller distribution centers for certain products and geographic areas. The distribution centers are able to fill customer orders and reduce inventory on-hand as a result of this centralized consolidation of inventory. Products are delivered to customers’ warehouses from the distribution centers using common carriers. A small number of our customers pick up their orders directly from our distribution centers. 
The DTW model is enabled by our extended shelf life (“ESL”) technology. As a result of our DTW model, we do not keep a significant backlog of finished goods inventory, as our bakery products are promptly shipped to our distribution centers after being produced. Some of our products are shipped frozen at the request of certain customers.
We believe our DTW distribution model enables access to a substantial whitespace opportunity. It provides greater reach into convenience, drug and dollar stores. Distributing to these channels under a DSD model can be inefficient due to small average drop size. Historically, DSD snack cake companies have competed with candy and tobacco companies for distribution; however, under our DTW model we partner with these third-party distributors to profitably penetrate both the convenience store and drug store channels and who are looking for opportunities to gain share in the SBG category. In 2020, convenience and drug stores accounted for 30.1% of our net revenues. We have established a strong presence and market share in the convenience and drug channels and are focused on 
continuously expanding coverage. These partnerships further expand our distribution reach in a highly efficient manner, and we believe they will add to our growth potential going forward. The conversion of the Voortman operations to the DTW model provides an opportunity to introduce new product forms and pack-types into the convenience store channel, such as single-serve Mega Size wafer products, which will be available in stores in 2021.
We have a tailored channel-based go-to-market model that demonstrates key capabilities for growth. We continue to invest in data capabilities, which enables focus on store-level compliance and growth opportunities with our Hostess Partner Program (“HPP”). We also have a unique consortium retail merchandising approach where we partner with brokers to drive in-store performance at lower costs.
We believe that impulse purchase decisions are another fundamental driver of retail sales of our products, which makes prominent in-store placement an essential growth lever. The DTW and centralized distribution model provide us with a competitive advantage through the ability to utilize retail-ready corrugate displays. These pre-built displays are visually impactful, economically produced, and require minimal in-store labor to assemble or load; thus providing cost-efficient display vehicles that benefit both us and the retailer. Preloaded displays also allow us full control over our brand marketing and the ability to execute retailer-wide campaigns regionally or nationally in a consistent manner, providing a unique competitive advantage across the entire SBG category, which our competitors predominantly serve through a DSD model.
COVID-19 modified consumer behaviors, including increasing in-home consumption and disrupting the timing and extent of certain seasonal trends. In response, we made changes to certain merchandising efforts and promotional programs. In addition, our marketing efforts increased in key areas to accelerate growth, including developing new digital programming, which will continue to support our next phase of growth.
Our business model is supported by cost-advantaged manufacturing and distribution, expanded channel/retail store reach and enhanced in-store merchandising capabilities and offers our retail partners attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
We continue to invest in the business to further our strategic initiatives. Our disciplined capital investment focus will be on operational capabilities that directly support or expand our growth and innovation with strong return on investment metrics. Further, we anticipate continued investment in automation, which allows for improved product quality, consistency and efficiency. 
Execute strategic acquisitions to accelerate growth
We have a solid platform for growth through acquisitions. Within the fragmented consumer packaged goods market the opportunity exists to drive value creation through acquisitions by leveraging our brand, infrastructure and performance-driven management culture. We are committed to seeking out opportunities that add new capabilities to our already broad offerings. 
The acquisition of Voortman in January 2020 diversified and expanded our product offerings and manufacturing capabilities in the attractive, adjacent $6.9 billion cookie category (based on Nielsen data as of December 26, 2020). The Voortman® brand and its unique product offerings have the #1 share of the sugar-free and wafer segments within this category. The acquisition also leverages our broad customer reach and lean and agile business model. During 2020, we integrated Voortman's distribution model into our DTW structure, with all Voortman U.S. sales shipping through our centralized distribution center. In addition to sharing established, efficient infrastructure, we can benefit from the strengthening of collaborative retail partnerships in the United States and Canada. 
As we explore other strategic acquisition opportunities, we will consider our ability to leverage our existing brands or reinvigorate acquired brands within the snacking category. We will also consider our ability to integrate acquisitions with our existing business and the opportunities to generate synergies through leveraging our existing assets and warehouse model. The successful integration of Voortman during 2020 exhibits our ability to execute and integrate acquisitions in adjacent categories. We believe our scale, access to capital and management experience will allow us to execute and integrate additional acquisitions.
The Category: Large and Attractive
The average American consumer eats 2 to 3 snacks per day with snacking occasions spread throughout the day starting at breakfast. The U.S. SBG category is one of the largest categories within the broader U.S. Total Snack category, with retail sales of $6.9 billion according to the Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2020. The SBG category includes breakfast items (e.g., donuts, breakfast danishes and muffins) and all-day snacking items (e.g., snack cakes, pies, bars and brownies). With consumer snacking needs ranging from satisfying hunger, providing an emotional lift and increasing social connection, we believe our product portfolio is well positioned to benefit from these broader snacking trends.
Our expansion into the cookie category with the purchase of Voortman in 2020 provides another platform to capitalize on the growth in consumer snacking. Voortman's products are in the specialty cookie segment and play into consumer trends towards high quality and better-for-you ingredients. 
Competitive landscape
Hostess® is the #2 brand in the U.S. SBG category. The top three brands, Hostess®, Little Debbie, and Entenmann's account for 65.2% of the SBG retail sales according to Nielsen, while the rest of the category remains fairly fragmented. With limited private label penetration in the category, consumers have shown a strong preference for trusted brands within the SBG category. The leading positions are solidified through extensive product portfolios, strong brand awareness, established distribution capabilities and long-standing relationships with critical high-volume retailers. Furthermore, high levels of capital investment are required to establish manufacturing and distribution capabilities of meaningful scale, providing additional barriers to entry.
Voortman® has the #1 creme wafer and sugar-free cookie products within the larger cookie category. Nabisco® is the top brand with approximately 44% of the category according to Nielsen. There is higher private label penetration in the cookie category than the SBG category.
We face competition from other brands, large national bakeries, smaller regional operators and supermarket chains with their own private label brands. The key competitive factors in the industry include product quality, price, customer service, brand recognition and loyalty, promotional activities, access to retail outlets, sufficient shelf-space and ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Some of our largest national competitors include Flowers Foods, Inc., Grupo Bimbo, S.A., McKee Foods Corporation and Mondelez International, Inc. In addition, we also compete with regional manufacturers and other companies that produce cookies, candies and other snacks. At times, we experience pricing pressure in certain markets from competitor promotions and other pricing practices. However, we believe our brand recognition, product quality and innovation have generated consumer loyalty to many of our products which helps mitigate this impact.
Seasonality
Sweet baked goods revenues tend to be moderately seasonal, with declines during the early winter period, which we believe are attributable to altered consumption patterns during the holiday season. We expect this trend to continue to be applicable to our business. We strive to mitigate the seasonality by running certain targeted promotional campaigns. Certain promotional campaigns, including Back to School and Halloween were modified in 2020 to respond to changes in consumer habits due to the impact of COVID-19. 
Production
We have a lean, agile and scalable model that delivers quality results. We produce our products at five bakeries located in Emporia, Kansas; Columbus, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; and Burlington, Ontario. We have made significant efforts to protect the safety of our bakery employees during the COVID-19 pandemic through additional safety protocols and sanitation measures. Our state of the art auto-bake technologies have resulted in significant energy, labor and time savings. The technology provides fully-automated industrial baking ovens and systems, combining cost efficient, compact and continuous baking solutions that can be custom configured. With the increase in demand for our Hostess® branded products, we continue to make adjustments to our production schedules, product assortment and equipment to maximize production capacity in our existing facilities. A portion of our products are manufactured and packaged by third parties under our brands and distributed through our facilities.
Raw Materials
Our principal raw materials are flour, sweeteners, edible oils and compound coating, as well as corrugate and films used to package our products. We utilize various buying strategies to lock in prices for certain raw materials and packaging to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we are dependent on natural gas as fuel for firing our ovens. Our third-party common carriers use gasoline and diesel as fuel for their trucks.
We have strategic, long-term relationships with our key suppliers for our raw materials and packaging that help leverage our buying power. While the cost of some raw materials has, and may continue to increase or decrease over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of raw materials as needed. We also sole source certain raw materials. We have multiple vendors that meet our supply requirements for the sole sourced materials, except in the case of certain enzymes used in our ESL technology. With respect to these enzymes, we continue to evaluate other sources in order to maintain business continuity and flexibility. Through cooperation with our suppliers, we have experienced no significant disruption to our supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Customers
Our top 10 customers in 2020 accounted for 59.4% of total net revenue. During 2020, our largest customer, Wal-Mart and related entities, represented 20.2% of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2020 net revenue. The loss of, or a material negative change in, our relationship with Wal-Mart or any of our other top 10 customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers and distributors, convenience, drug and dollar stores.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered Hostess®, Voortman®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill®, and Big Texas® brand trademarks and our sub-brand trademarks, including Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Zingers®, Sno Balls®, and Donettes®, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. These trademarks have a perpetual life, subject to renewal. This provides us the opportunity to sell our products at premium price points and pursue licensing opportunities.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. We rely on laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Research and Development
The majority of our research and development spend is dedicated to enhancing and expanding our product lines, responding to changing consumer preferences and trends and continuing to enhance the taste of our products. In addition, our research and development organization provides technical support to ensure that our core products are consistently produced in accordance with our high standards of quality and specifications. Finally, our research and development department is charged with developing processes to reduce our costs without adversely affecting the quality of our products. During 2020, we opened a new innovation lab within our Lenexa, Kansas corporate office. This lab provides us the testing capabilities, analytics and market research insights we need to support innovation that meets consumer needs and expectations.
Government Regulation
Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), as well as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (“CFIA”) and Health Canada for Canadian Operations. Our products are subject to various local, state, and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating registrations and licensing, health and sanitation standards, ingredient standards, current Good Manufacturing Practices and traceability, hazard analysis and risk-based preventative controls, food labeling and advertising, hazard reporting and recall requirements, equal employment, wage and hour requirements, and environmental protection, among others. Also, during 2020, we were subject to compliance with movement restrictions and other efforts by local governments to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We take compliance and the safety of our products and employees seriously and take all steps that we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 3,000 people. Of our total workforce, approximately 90% were located at our bakery facilities. The remaining workers comprised functions including operations management, sales and supply chain, among other corporate functions. 
Safety is one of our top priorities, and we are proud to have shown a 3-year track record of improvement, with 2020 results for key metrics ahead of industry benchmarks for categories consistent with Occupational Safety & Heath Administration (OSHA) standards. We develop and maintain safety policies in our operating facilities and conduct periodic audits to ensure compliance. We believe new automation, safety investments and behavioral safety training have resulted in higher employee engagement and lower workers’ compensation costs. We have taken additional measures during 2020 to maintain a safe working environment for our employees amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote work (where practical), enhanced safety and sanitation protocols, employee health screenings and providing face coverings. 
We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with the local unions of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union in Indianapolis, Indiana, Columbus, Georgia and International (through our Burlington, Ontario facility); AFL-CIO and the Chemical Production Workers Union Local No. 30 in Chicago, Illinois. Approximately 1,200 employees are covered by these collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with employees to be good and have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.
Our ability to achieve sustained, profitable results is predicated on our ability to attract, retain, and engage a team of employees aligned on a common purpose: to deliver products that create moments of joy for our customers and consumers. We are committed to providing a safe work environment, competitive wage and benefits packages, career development opportunities and an inclusive culture that encourages employees to bring their whole self to work. 
Maintaining a positive work culture is critical to our ability to achieve our performance goals. We believe diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are key to maintaining our positive culture. We focus on our culture through a combination of regular training for employees at all levels, policies and practices in support of these goals, and a variety of internal and community based events and actions that reinforce the power of our shared Company values and the unique characteristics of each of our employees.
To ensure we know what is important to our employees, we conduct periodic engagement surveys, roundtable meetings with groups of employees, and action planning processes to track progress against identified themes. Many of these actions are employee developed and led; all employees can lead, regardless of title.
The Company’s culture is an integral part of our strategy, built on innovation, collaboration and a competitive spirit. Embodying these tenets is a strong and experienced management team, led by Andy Callahan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Members of the management team have extensive experience in the consumer packaged goods industry across the sales, operations, marketing, legal and finance disciplines. 
Our management team is complemented by an experienced Board of Directors, all of whom have senior executive leadership experience and bring with them extensive consumer products knowledge. Our board members and management include:
