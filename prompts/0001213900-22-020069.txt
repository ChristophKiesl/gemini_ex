ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview



Empire Global Gaming, Inc. (the “Company,” “We” or “Our”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 11, 2010 to participate in the worldwide gaming market. We offer custom gaming solutions for each customer’s individual needs. We provide consulting and advisory services to the gaming industry.
Other Products



We will be developing patented games into video and slot machine terminals as well as computer and mobile devices.



The Company has taken certain steps to become fully “e-commerce” operational while awaiting Gaming Board approvals. We operate a website located at: www.empireglobalgaminginc.com.



Industry Overview



The domestic and global gaming markets have grown rapidly and consistently over most of the last decade despite some slowdown in the past three years due to the macroeconomic recession. This growth has generally brought increased social and political acceptance of legalized gaming throughout many diverse societies. The conventional wisdom that the gaming industry is recession- proof has been challenged over the last three years. However, recent economic pressures have prompted new efforts to legalize casino gaming and to liberalize gaming laws to fill fiscal gaps. Furthermore, in the current environment, operators are pressured to extract the most out of existing operations by enhancing the competitiveness of their floor at minimal investment rather than deploying cash into new or expanded equipment or facilities. While historical U.S. trends suggest a resilient recovery will eventually be at hand, through our proprietary products, we expect to offer the casino operator products that will enhance the gaming machine’s productivity while simultaneously enhancing the customer’s playing experience.
Competition



The gaming business is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of games produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we do.
Government Regulation



We are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in most jurisdictions in which we operate. Gaming regulatory requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and obtaining licenses and findings of suitability for our officers, directors, and principal stockholders, registrations, and other required approvals with respect to us, our personnel, and our products are time consuming and expensive. Generally, gaming regulatory authorities have broad discretionary powers and may deny applications for or revoke approvals on any basis they deem reasonable. We have not yet obtained approvals that enable us to conduct our (gaming) business in any jurisdictions. In the event a gaming jurisdiction determines that an officer, director, key employee, stockholder, or other personnel of our company is unsuitable to act in such a capacity, we will be required to terminate our relationship with such person or lose our rights and privileges in that jurisdiction. This may have a materially adverse effect on us. We may be unable to obtain all the necessary licenses and approvals or ensure that our officers, directors, key employees, affiliates, and certain other stockholders will satisfy the suitability requirements in each jurisdiction in which our products are sold or used. The failure to obtain such licenses and approvals in one jurisdiction may affect our licensure and approvals in other jurisdictions. In addition, a significant delay in obtaining such licenses and approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.
Board of Directors



As of December 5, 2018, Nicholas Sorge, Sr. was the President and Director and Dolores Marsh was the Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Director. On December 6, 2018, the Board of Directors approved and authorized the appointment of A. Stone Douglass as Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Nicholas Sorge Sr. remained as the President and a Director, as well as the interim Chief Financial Officer. Dolores Marsh stepped down as an officer and Director of the Company. On January 28, 2022, A Stone Douglass resigned from his positions and the Board of Directors approved and authorized the appointment of Michael Armandi as Chief Executive Officer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors. We have not employed additional people either on a full time or part time basis.
