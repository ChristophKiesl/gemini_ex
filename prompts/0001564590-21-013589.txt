Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel therapies for the treatment of fibrosis and related diseases. Our initial focus is on treating fibrosis by inhibiting integrin-mediated activation of TGF-ß. We have applied our deep understanding of fibrosis biology, along with our medicinal chemistry and translational medicine expertise to develop a set of proprietary tools designed to discover and de-risk product candidates quickly and efficiently. Our wholly owned lead product candidate, PLN-74809, is an oral, small-molecule, dual selective inhibitor of αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins that we are developing for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC. We have completed a Phase 1a SAD/MAD trial and a Phase 1b proof-of-mechanism trial of PLN-74809 in IPF and are currently recruiting three Phase 2a trials in our lead indications: two in IPF and one in PSC. We expect to announce preliminary data from our first Phase 2a IPF trial in the first half of 2021. Our second product candidate, PLN-1474, is a small-molecule selective inhibitor of αvβ1 for the treatment of liver fibrosis associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, which we have partnered with Novartis. PLN-1474 has successfully completed a Phase 1 SAD/MAD trial and the Investigational New Drug, or IND, application was transferred to Novartis in the first quarter of 2021. Novartis will be responsible for all future PLN-1474 development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities. In addition to our clinical programs, we currently have preclinical integrin-based programs targeting oncology and muscular dystrophies.
 Fibrosis refers to the abnormal thickening and scarring of connective tissue due to the production and deposition of excess collagen in the extra-cellular matrix. Fibrosis can occur in many different tissues including lung, liver, kidney, muscle, skin, and the gastrointestinal tract, and often causes severe and debilitating disease potentially leading to organ failure and death. Fibrosis has historically proven difficult to treat, which we believe is due to the complexity of the disease biology and the challenge of targeting fibrotic tissues selectively without affecting healthy tissues.
 We believe that tissue-specific inhibition of TGF-ß may hold the key to successfully treating fibrosis. In normal tissues TGF-ß is activated in response to tissue injury which initiates a cascade that results in collagen production and, ultimately, scar formation to heal the tissue. In fibrosis, however, TGF-ß signaling becomes dysregulated, with TGF-ß being continuously activated, leading to excess collagen deposition, even in the absence of acute tissue injury. TGF-ß, while implicated in fibrosis pathophysiology, is expressed, and intermittently activated across all tissue types and plays important, context-specific roles in tissue homeostasis. Therefore, TGF-ß cannot be blocked systemically without disrupting these homeostatic functions and causing significant toxicities. To treat fibrosis more precisely in specific tissues, we believe it is crucial to discover and treat the underlying mechanism causing excess TGF-ß activation.
 Our scientific founders are pioneers in elucidating the role of specific extracellular receptors known as integrins as a key element in the activation of TGF-ß. While the role of integrins in TGF-ß activation has been well-characterized over the past 10 years, integrins have historically been difficult to target therapeutically using small-molecules due to the difficulty of engineering molecules with high receptor selectivity and bioavailability. We believe that we have addressed these challenges with our platform. We have built a library of compounds that includes bioavailable, selective, and potent inhibitors of multiple integrins that may be used to target a range of fibrotic diseases across different tissues.

Our Pipeline


Our lead wholly owned product candidate, PLN-74809, is an oral small-molecule, dual-selective inhibitor of αvβ6 and αvβ1 that we are advancing in IPF and PSC. While expressed at very low levels in normal tissues, αvβ6 and αvβ1 are upregulated in the pulmonary tissues of IPF patients, and in the liver tissues of PSC patients. They both serve as activators of TGF-ß, leading to increased collagen production and fibrosis in these tissues. By blocking TGF-ß activation by both αvβ6 and αvβ1, we believe PLN-74809 may slow and potentially halt the progression of fibrosis in these patient populations. PLN-74809 has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for both IPF and PSC.
 IPF is the most common and severe form of progressive pulmonary fibrosis, affecting approximately 140,000 patients in the United States. While the underlying cause of IPF is unknown, the course of the disease is well documented, with progressive scarring that destroys the structure and function of the lungs over time. The average life expectancy for patients with confirmed IPF is between three and five years. There are currently two FDA-approved therapies for IPF. Both have shown modest slowing of disease progression. However, both therapies have raised significant safety and tolerability concerns.
 PSC is a progressive liver disorder affecting approximately 30,000 to 45,000 patients in the United States. The disease is characterized by fibrosis originating in the bile ducts that ultimately results in bile flow obstruction, or cholestasis, causing liver damage and progressive fibrosis of the liver. Patients have a median survival of 10 to 12 years without intervention and carry high lifetime risk of developing gastrointestinal malignancies. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for PSC.
 In our live human tissue assay, PLN-74809 showed a greater than 50 percent decrease in the expression of pro-fibrotic genes, such as collagen type I alpha1 chain, or COL1A1, and collagen type 3 alpha1 chain, or COL3A1, that are responsible for collagen production in human IPF and PSC tissues. Additionally, we have completed a study in non-human primates in which we showed that inhibition of αvβ6 and αvβ1 reduced TGF-ß activation by greater than 75% in cells isolated from the lungs after seven days of treatment.
 We have completed Phase 1a single ascending dose, or SAD, multiple ascending dose, or MAD, and food effect clinical trials in which PLN-74809 was shown to be orally bioavailable and generally well tolerated with a half-life that may support once-daily dosing.
 We have also completed a Phase 1b proof-of-mechanism trial in healthy volunteers evaluating PLN-74809’s ability to inhibit TGF-ß activation as measured through pSMAD2/3 levels. pSMADs act as signaling molecules directly downstream from the TGF-ß receptor, and therefore pSMAD2/3 levels can be used as a reliable biomarker for TGF-ß activation. In the Phase 1b trial, PLN-74809 was shown to inhibit TGF-ß activation by up to 70% in alveolar macrophages collected from healthy volunteers, in a dose- and exposure-dependent manner. Additionally, PLN-74809 was well tolerated with only mild adverse events and no drug-related adverse events.

We are recruiting two Phase 2a trials of PLN-74809 in IPF. In the first of these trials, we are enrolling up to 12 IPF patients and utilizing a positron emission tomography, or PET, ligand to measure αvβ6 target engagement by PLN-74809 in the lungs post-treatment with ascending single doses of PLN-74809. We expect to announce preliminary data from this trial in the first half of 2021.
 The second trial is a 12-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling up to 84 IPF patients across four cohorts consisting of three doses of PLN-74809 and one placebo that will evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, or PK. We also plan to employ exploratory efficacy endpoints including Quantitative Lung Fibrosis, or QLF, imaging analysis, biomarkers, and pulmonary function tests including FVC. This trial is currently on track to complete enrollment by the end of 2021.
 We are also recruiting a Phase 2a trial of PLN-74809 in PSC. The trial is a 12-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling up to 84 PSC patients across four cohorts consisting of three doses of PLN-74809 and one placebo that will evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK. We also plan to employ exploratory efficacy endpoints including fibrosis biomarkers such as Pro-C3 and ELF, as well as ALP and liver imaging. This trial is currently on track to complete enrollment by mid-2022.
 Our second clinical stage product candidate, PLN-1474, is a small-molecule, selective inhibitor of TGF-ß activation by the integrin αvβ1, in development for treatment of liver fibrosis associated with NASH. αvβ1 serves as an activator of TGF-ß and its expression has been shown to be upregulated in hepatic stellate cells in late-stage NASH-associated liver fibrosis. In October 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Novartis in which Novartis licensed global rights to PLN-1474. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a $50 million license fee, as well as $30 million of equity investment.  Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $416 million in total milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties on products commercialized from the collaboration.
 NASH is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, that is associated with the development of liver fibrosis and potentially life-threatening liver dysfunction. NASH is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 16.5 million adults in the United States, including approximately 3.3 million with late-stage liver fibrosis. Over time, NASH-related liver fibrosis may progress to cirrhosis, resulting in impaired liver function and increased risk of liver-related complications and mortality. There are currently no FDA approved therapies for NASH, and to date investigational NASH therapies have only shown modest anti-fibrotic benefits in clinical trials.  
 We have shown through our assays of live human fibrotic liver tissue that PLN-1474 is able to decrease the expression of pro-fibrotic genes such as COL1A1, the gene associated with the production of the most abundant type of collagen produced in fibrosis. We have also shown in multiple animal models of NASH that PLN-1474 has a potent anti-fibrotic effect.
 We have completed 
a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 dose escalation trial that enrolled 84 healthy volunteers across single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose cohorts. Results showed that PLN-1474 was rapidly absorbed and well tolerated with no dose- or treatment-limiting toxicities with adverse events that were mostly mild with no severe or serious adverse events observed. The PLN-1474 IND application was transferred to Novartis in the first quarter of 2021.
 Pursuant to our collaboration with Novartis, Novartis reimburses us for all development activities associated with the PLN-1474 Phase 1 trials and will be responsible for all development, manufacturing, and commercialization once the IND is transferred. In addition to PLN-1474, during the research term, Novartis is also collaborating with us on up to three separate integrin research programs. We will be eligible to receive up to $416.0 million in total from various developmental regulatory and commercial milestones as well as tiered royalties, on a product-by-product basis based on annual nets sales of products, at percentages ranging from high-single digits to low teens of the applicable licensed products and mid-single digits to high-single digits for any products resulting from the research programs.
 In addition to our clinical programs, we are developing two additional preclinical integrin-based programs. The first of these is our oncology program. As TGF-ß biology has been elucidated, it has become increasingly understood in the scientific literature that TGF-ß plays an important anti-inflammatory role in the tumor micro-environment, preventing T-cell infiltration and inhibiting release of various cytokines. This mechanism is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential cause of the resistance to checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 therapies seen in many tumors. We are targeting the TGF-ß activating integrin αvβ8, which is upregulated in certain tumors with the goal of sensitizing tumors to checkpoint inhibitors. This program has generated positive data in preclinical tumor models and our candidate is currently undergoing IND-enabling studies.
 Our second preclinical program is an allosteric agonistic monoclonal antibody against an undisclosed integrin receptor being developed for treatment of muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The target integrin is upregulated on muscle cells across multiple muscular dystrophy indications, acting as a substitute for dystrophin and helping to anchor muscle cells to the extracellular matrix. The program utilizes an allosteric agonistic antibody to activate the target in order to augment the naturally occurring compensatory mechanism. Because the antibody is not mutation specific, it could potentially be effective as a single therapy 
 5

or in combination with other treatment modalities across multiple muscular dystrophy indications. This program is currently in the candidate selection phase of development.
 Pliant was formed to build upon our scientific founders’ pioneering work elucidating the biology of fibrosis and its underlying causes. Our mission is to advance the understanding of fibrosis by building a biology-, chemistry- and screening-based engine to drive drug development across the spectrum of fibrotic diseases. We have established what we believe is a leading capability to both identify relevant fibrosis targets across different tissue types and address those targets with product candidates that have been optimized for potency and selectivity. We have established collaborations with medical research institutions and tissue networks that provide us access to human fibrotic tissue from patients undergoing transplant to use in evaluation of our product candidates and share insights with thought leaders to further engage them in our mission. By refining the development of biology-driven product candidates in our laboratories through testing in freshly obtained human fibrotic tissue, we believe that we may be able to increase the efficiency of our development process and maximize the probability of success. 
 We have assembled an executive team with highly relevant experience in fibrosis, small-molecule drug discovery and clinical development. Bernard Coulie, M.D., Ph.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, has 20 years of experience in drug development, previously serving as CEO and Chief Medical Officer of ActoGeniX, as well as holding senior roles at Johnson & Johnson. Éric Lefebvre, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer, brings deep experience in clinical development in liver disease. He previously served as head of clinical research and development for NASH at Allergan. Prior to Allergan, Dr. Lefebvre led HIV and HCV development at Janssen and later served as CMO at Tobira. We were founded by world-renowned researchers Dean Sheppard, M.D., Rik Derynck, Ph.D., Bill DeGrado, Ph.D. and Hal Chapman, M.D., all from the University of California, San Francisco, who bring broad experience in fibrosis biology and small-molecule chemistry among other related disciplines.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a world-leading fibrosis company, developing and commercializing disease-modifying therapies across a spectrum of fibrotic diseases. To achieve this, we are focused on the following key strategies:

• | Rapidly advance PLN-74809 in IPF and PSC through clinical development and commercialization. We are developing our lead oral small-molecule inhibitor of αvβ6 and αvβ1 as a novel therapy for IPF and PSC, each an area of high unmet medical need. Both IPF and PSC are orphan indications that we believe we can commercialize on our own in key geographies using targeted sales forces.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively evaluate additional partnerships in indications and geographies where we believe partners can add significant commercial and/or development capabilities. Fibrotic diseases represent a broad set of disease indications to pursue. Our focus is to commercialize our assets in orphan fibrosis indications and to selectively work with partners in larger indications and in geographies outside of North America. Given the size and competitive dynamics of the NASH indication, we believe that our collaboration with Novartis provides PLN-1474 a strong platform for advancement. Furthermore, we will evaluate and potentially choose to partner our unpartnered product candidates in indications outside of fibrosis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore opportunities for our pipeline assets in additional fibrotic indications. We are evaluating the potential benefit of our product candidates outside of their lead indications. Our product candidates have shown anti-fibrotic activity in multiple animal models as well as human tissue in indications outside of IPF, PSC, and NASH. We will continue to evaluate additional indications to maximize the potential of our pipeline.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our industry leading tools and capabilities to advance our mission of becoming a leading fibrosis company. Since our founding we have endeavored to advance the understanding of fibrosis biology, uncover new targets and advance novel product candidates. Currently, our proprietary capabilities include a target expression atlas, an expansive library of over 7,000 integrin inhibitor molecules, integrin screening assay platform, live fibrotic human tissue program, PET-ligand imaging program, and biomarker assays. We continue to expand our integrin inhibitor library and develop tools such as additional PET-ligands as well as novel disease biomarkers. In addition, we have a library of over 70,000 compounds for non-integrin targets. We intend to leverage these tools and capabilities in a target- and modality-agnostic manner to expand our pipeline with a mission to become a world-leading fibrosis company.

Fibrosis: A Condition of Uncontrolled Scarring
 Fibrosis refers to excessive scarring often resulting from aberrant tissue repair processes. In normal tissues, fibrotic pathways represent a repair mechanism by which the tissues heal themselves in response to injury or disease. These pathways are normally deactivated upon completion of tissue repair. However, when they become dysregulated and remain activated, excess collagen deposition can cause tissues to thicken and become stiff, ultimately impairing their physiological function.
 Fibrosis is a disease of connective tissue. Normal connective tissue forms a supportive network between cells, lending structure and integrity to tissues built up of many cell types. Connective tissue is composed of collagenous and elastic fibers, as well as a 
 6

number of supporting cells such as fibroblasts and white blood cells. These supporting cells are embedded in a gel-like matrix made up of proteins known as the extra-cellular matrix. The most important protein in this matrix is collagen, which takes the form of elongated, fine fibers, providing flexible support to the surrounding cells. In fibrotic tissues, initial insults such as tissue damage or inflammation spur the deposition of excess collagen. Normally such responses are balanced in finely controlled feedback loops, but in fibrotic disease these feedback loops are dysregulated, resulting in progressive scarring, thickening, and loss of function.
 Fibrosis occurs in many organ systems throughout the body including the lungs, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and muscles. While the exact pathologies of diseases in these organs vary, the development of fibrosis involves many common cell types and biochemical pathways, including the TGF-ß signaling pathway. The ultimate result is similar across many tissues: secretion and extracellular activation of growth factors that stimulate fibroblasts to secrete excess collagen, leading to runaway growth of scar tissue.
 

Role of TGF-ß Signaling in Fibrosis
 We believe that selectively inhibiting TGF-ß activation holds the key to successfully treating fibrosis across multiple tissues and organs. TGF-ß is secreted by nearly all cells and organs in mammals and stored in large amounts outside of cells, in the extra-cellular matrix, as part of an inactive complex. In healthy tissues, TGF-ß is transiently activated in response to tissue injury which initiates a cascade that results in collagen production and, ultimately, healing of the tissue. In fibrosis, however TGF-ß signaling becomes dysregulated and perpetuated, with TGF-ß being continuously activated, leading to excess collagen deposition in the absence of acute tissue injury. Moreover, induced activation of TGF-ß alone in animal models has been shown to be sufficient to induce fibrosis, and inhibition of TGF-ß activation has been shown to prevent or attenuate fibrosis.
 TGF-ß can be activated in multiple ways in response to specific tissue injury. One important class of cell-surface proteins that activate TGF-ß in fibrosis are integrins. Integrins have a variety of functions, including signaling inside the cells, providing tissue structure and stability through adhesion between cells. Integrins are heterodimeric proteins, meaning they are composed of two different protein subunits paired together. These subunits are known as α and ß subunits. In humans, there are eighteen distinct α subunits and eight distinct ß subunits, which combine to form 24 known and functional integrin pairs.
 Certain integrins bind the inactive TGF-ß complex. In response to tissue injury, the cells expressing these integrins are induced to contract, exerting physical force on the bound TGF-ß complex. This mechanical force changes the shape of the complex, releasing active TGF-ß. This activation triggers a biological cascade which results in collagen production, and when dysregulated leads to fibrosis. As depicted in the figure below, this cascade involves (i) binding of active TGF-ß to its receptor, the TGF-ß type I receptor kinase also known as ALK5; (ii) phosphorylation of immediate downstream signaling proteins known as SMAD2 and SMAD3; (iii) formation of a transcription initiation complex by pSMAD2, pSMAD3 and SMAD4; and (iv) subsequent transcription of target genes that encode fibrotic proteins such as collagen. Importantly, whereas certain TGF-ß-activating integrins are expressed at very low levels in healthy tissues, the TGF-ß cascade can lead to the upregulation of these integrins resulting in a TGF-ß-driven positive feed-forward loop which further increases TGF-ß activation. Furthermore, as fibrosis progresses and the fibrotic organ gets stiffer, it becomes progressively easier for contracting cells to activate integrin-bound TGF-ß. It is because of this continued, tissue-specific upregulation of integrins and their key roles in continued TGF-ß-activation that we believe that integrins provide an avenue to selectively inhibit TGF-ß activation in fibrotic tissue without affecting TGF-ß’s important physiological roles in healthy tissues.

Model of integrin regulation of TGF-ß signaling
 Historical Challenges to Drug Development in Fibrosis
 Fibrosis has historically been a difficult therapeutic area to target pharmaceutically. The biology and underlying causes of fibrosis are complex and, in many diseases, poorly understood. In the past, many patients with fibrotic disease were treated with anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids. While steroids may have a mild anti-fibrotic effect in some forms of fibrosis, they can exacerbate others, such as IPF. Additionally, the negative effects of chronic steroid exposure make it difficult to treat patients with these agents for long-term periods.
 More recently, it has become well understood that regardless of the underlying cause, TGF-ß activation is at the heart of several key processes that drive fibrosis, including collagen formation, deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and activation and proliferation of fibroblast cells. As such, much of the historic drug development efforts to treat fibrosis have been aimed at systemically inhibiting or disrupting the TGF-ß signaling pathway by either (i) blocking TGF-ß binding to the TGF-ß receptors with an antibody or (ii) preventing the type I TGF-ß receptor, also known as ALK5, from activating the SMADs using a small-molecule kinase inhibitor. However, because of TGF-ß’s role in normal physiology, these approaches cause substantial toxicity and dysregulation of normal functions. In fact, documented toxicities that arise from systemic inhibition of TGF-ß signaling include cardiac toxicity, inflammation, and focal epithelial hyperplasia.
 A potentially safer approach to fibrosis therapy is to inhibit specific pro-fibrotic signaling molecules, such as connective tissue growth factor and autotaxin, which operate downstream of TGF-ß activation, thereby mitigating the tolerability issues associated with systemic TGF-ß inhibition. While tolerability has been shown to improve with this approach, the efficacy shown to date has been modest, likely because TGF-ß activates multiple pro-fibrotic signaling pathways in addition to those targeted by these approaches.
 Another recent approach is to prevent TGF-ß activation by stabilizing TGF-ß in its inactive form. However, it is not known whether latent TGF-ß stabilization can be accomplished in a tissue specific manner.
 In addition to the historical difficulty in targeting TGF-ß, clinical development for the treatment of fibrosis has also been limited by the lack of tools to understand this complex multicellular process. Only certain parts of this process can be modeled using cellular assays. More complete representations of fibrosis can be generated in animal models, but these models tend to be acute in nature and do not accurately represent disease pathology in humans which, in most cases, develops over decades. While fibrosis has historically been a difficult area of development, there has been significant interest in the space from large-cap pharma companies due to the relative scarcity of companies developing antifibrotic candidates. This is evidenced by several recent notable acquisitions in the space including Roche’s acquisitions of InterMune and Promedior, Allergan’s acquisition of Tobira, and Gilead’s strategic investment in Galapagos.

Integrin Inhibitors as a Potential Treatment for Fibrosis
 An ideal approach to fibrosis treatment would be one that inhibits TGF-ß activation in only those tissues where fibrosis is occurring. One potential way to accomplish this is to inhibit the integrin proteins that are known to be overexpressed in specific fibrotic tissue and cause the abnormal activation of TGF-ß. In several forms of fibrosis, namely IPF and PSC, TGF-ß activating integrins such as αvβ6 and αvβ1 are over-expressed. These integrins are normally expressed at low levels in healthy tissue. Therefore, we would not expect off-target toxicity effects by selectively inhibiting αvβ6 and avß1. By inhibiting fibrosis-specific TGF-ß activators such as these specific integrins, it is possible to block abnormal TGF-ß activation in the specific tissues where fibrosis occurs, without affecting TGF-ß signaling in healthy tissues. However, integrin drug development has historically been challenging due to the difficulty of developing small molecule integrin inhibitors that are both selective for specific integrins and bioavailable. Notably, a recent approach targeting integrins selectively with a monoclonal antibody was terminated due to safety concerns, which we believe may be related to antibody-mediated immune activation. We believe our pipeline of bioavailable highly selective small molecule integrin inhibitors has the potential to address these challenges.
 Recently, large biopharmaceutical companies have begun to recognize the potential of anti-integrin approaches to treat fibrosis and made large investments in the space. AbbVie recently in-licensed a set of preclinical integrin inhibitors for the treatment of fibrosis including an αvβ6 inhibitor targeting IPF. The AbbVie product candidate is a single selective inhibitor of αvβ6; however, it has been shown that the expression of both αvβ6 and αvβ1 is upregulated in IPF. We believe that our dual-selective αvβ6/αvβ1 inhibitor approach has the potential to provide a more potent anti-fibrotic effect than a single selective αvβ6 inhibitor.
 We believe that recent developments in the field of integrin inhibitors validate our initial focus on integrin inhibitors as a treatment for fibrosis. Utilizing our proprietary discovery and development capabilities, we believe that we have overcome key historical challenges to the development of integrin inhibitors, including potency, selectivity, and bioavailability. We have identified two bioavailable and highly potent and selective integrin inhibitors. Our lead product candidate, PLN-74809, has completed Phase 1a trials and has demonstrated potential for a once daily oral dosing profile.
 Our Capability and Approach to Fibrosis Drug Discovery and Development
 Our approach to drug development in fibrosis combines our deep knowledge of the biology of fibrosis with various cellular, tissue, and in vivo assays developed in house to interrogate the biology of fibrosis and uncover pathways and potential targets. We developed an extensive panel of cell assays, precision cut tissue assays and animal models covering various types of fibrotic diseases. These assays allow us to evaluate target expression in fibrotic tissues as well as the anti-fibrotic activity of our candidates after treatment and begin to establish proof-of-biological-mechanism in both animal models and human tissue prior to initiating clinical trials. We believe these collective capabilities uniquely allow us to (i) efficiently identify targets, (ii) optimize the potency and selectivity of candidates and (iii) de-risk product candidates in advance of human proof-of-concept.
 The first tool we use in our discovery process is our target expression atlas. Utilizing samples from normal and fibrotic human tissue, we developed a quantitative atlas of gene and protein expression across multiple fibrotic diseases. This database represents a wealth of data that we use to quantify expression of tissue specific targets for potential therapeutics. The atlas is continuously expanding through acquisition of additional samples as well as additional analyses. To date, we have advanced multiple potential targets to our early discovery pipeline.
 The second important tool in our discovery process is our compound library that we screen for activity against targets identified through our target atlas. While we are agnostic to treatment modality, our initial targeted chemistry effort has been focused on integrin inhibitors, and our medicinal chemistry team has developed a proprietary library of over 7,000 potential integrin inhibitors. The goal of the library is to maximize structural diversity while targeting optimal absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or ADME, properties. We expect that the library will continue to grow as we investigate new structures. We have designed the library based on in silico known X-ray structures/homology models, structure-activity relationships of structural motifs of known integrin inhibitors, and de novo molecular design. In addition to our proprietary integrin inhibitor library, we have a non-integrin compound library of over 70,000 compounds that we screen against non-integrin targets.
 Once we have identified a potential target through our target expression atlas, we screen our library of compounds against the target. We have developed screening assays for 20 of the 24 known integrins and use these assays to evaluate the potency and selectivity of binding for our potential drug candidates prior to preclinical studies. Given the selectivity and potency challenges that have hampered integrin drug development, we believe our integrin assay panel represents a major step forward in integrin-based drug development.
 We believe a key advantage of our development strategy is our ability to test our product candidates in live human fibrotic tissue, which helps us to bridge the gap between animal models and clinical proof-of-concept. We have developed proprietary 
 9

protocols that extend the viability of live human explant tissue samples which allow us to reproducibly perform multiday experiments. We also maintain an on-call, around the clock team that obtains tissue samples following transplant procedures and transports those tissues to our lab within hours of explant, in a highly coordinated process. Our access to these live tissue samples allows us to evaluate the effects of our product candidates on multiple markers of anti-fibrotic activity. The data from these experiments increase our confidence that the tested product candidates will show anti-fibrotic effects in patients. In this way, our human tissue program serves to further de-risk product candidates and increase their likelihood of success in the clinic.
 Once in clinical development, we seek to further de-risk our programs by designing clinical trials that allow us to show proof-of-mechanism in advance of clinical efficacy data. Because fibrosis is a chronic disease, proof-of-efficacy in human trials is expensive and takes years to complete. We utilize pharmacodynamic biomarkers and advanced imaging techniques, including PET, to evaluate target engagement by our product candidates over relatively short time periods and observe whether the product candidate is having the anticipated effect. We believe obtaining these clinical data points in an efficient manner will allow us to optimize our clinical development strategy and resource allocation.
 We and our partners also proactively conduct observational, natural history trials in target diseases to better understand disease pathophysiology and progression and develop new molecular biomarkers. Through these trials, we have gone on to develop patient registries and establish relationships with clinicians at leading medical research institutions dedicated to bringing novel fibrosis therapies to their patients.
 We are developing an extensive biomarker discovery and validation program. We are seeking to develop biomarkers to (i) identify patients at high risk of rapid disease progression, (ii) identify patients more likely to respond to treatment and (iii) monitor early treatment responses. We are conducting clinical studies and other research with leading academic centers to track disease progression and collect biological samples such as blood, urine, and tissue biopsies which we can use to discover and validate novel biomarkers.
 

Our systematic approach to identifying and targeting integrins in fibrosis
 Selective inhibition of TGF-ß activation in fibrotic tissues could potentially be the safest and most effective approach to treating fibrosis. One way to accomplish this is to inhibit the integrin receptors that drive excessive activation of TGF-ß. Given the importance of integrins in regulating the initial steps in fibrosis, we have focused our initial drug discovery efforts on a dual approach. This approach includes both biological profiling to identify which integrins are important in various diseased tissues and chemical profiling of libraries containing proprietary integrin inhibitors to help determine their selectivity and potency for individual integrins.
 Utilizing our extensive in-house medicinal chemistry expertise, we have created a library of over 7,000 integrin-inhibitors. We screen this library against the integrin targets that we identify through our expression atlas and or biological profiling process. To our knowledge, this type of industrial-scale, systematic biological and chemical profiling, seeking selective inhibitors of one or more integrins, has not previously been carried out. We believe this combination makes our approach distinctive.
 Central to our integrin inhibitor discovery process are our integrin assay panels. A key challenge in integrin inhibition, historically, has been selectivity for specific integrins. To address this challenge, we have developed assays against the 20 most relevant known integrins. We use these screening assays to measure potency and selectivity of potential candidates against these integrins. This allows us to quickly optimize the integrin binding profiles of potential development candidates in an iterative process.

 10

Integrins can undergo conformational change. This results in different binding affinities. We believe an ideal integrin inhibitor should potently bind across the spectrum of conformations. Through the use of specific assays, we can measure the potency of our product candidates against multiple integrin conformations and seek to optimize for candidates that are able to potently bind to all conformations.
 In addition to our deep understanding of integrin biology, we have gained significant insight in structure-activity relationships that determine integrin selectivity and optimal PK profiles. Utilizing this knowledge, we are now able to precisely engineer bioavailable integrin inhibitors with high potency and desired selectivity.
 Our integrin inhibitor profiling capability has enabled us to quickly identify inhibitors that target individual integrins such as PLN-1474, which selectively inhibits αvβ1, as well as dual inhibitors such PLN-74809 which selectively targets both αvβ6 and αvβ1. Combining the data from our biological profiling and chemical profiling sets has enabled us to identify compounds that we believe have the highest potential for therapeutic activity in specific fibrotic diseases. Our iterative drug discovery effort focuses on drug-like properties of compounds early in the testing process. Compounds are screened for in vitro potency/selectivity and ADME/PK properties. This enables us to move from compound optimization to in vivo testing in a matter of months.
 We continue to evaluate our broad proprietary library of integrin inhibitors to identify additional product candidates to treat fibrotic diseases. Furthermore, our approach allows us to use our discovery and development capabilities to develop non-integrin therapeutic modalities to treat fibrotic diseases. Our rich library also provides a deep series of potential backup molecules with structurally unique chemotypes that we believe can enhance the probability of clinical success.
 As with all of our development efforts, a key approach to preclinically de-risking our integrin inhibitor candidates is evaluation of candidates in live human fibrotic tissue obtained following transplant procedures. The ability to observe effects of our product candidates on gene expression in human tissues prior to entering the clinic provides a bridge from animal models to clinical proof-of-concept and helps give us additional confidence as we move toward human trials. Similarly, if our ex vivo live human tissue studies show little or no effect on the target genes, we can quickly reallocate resources, saving time and money, and minimizing unnecessary patient exposure.
 A second important de-risking strategy involves biomarker measurement in both preclinical and early-stage clinical studies. By utilizing specific biomarkers such as pSMAD2/3 that operate immediately downstream from TGF-ß, we are able to measure the effects of our drugs on TGF-ß activation. We believe understanding the ability of our drug candidates to reduce TGF-ß activation is crucial to gaining confidence in the anti-fibrotic activity of our product candidates as we move forward in the clinic.
 In our Phase 2 clinical trials, we will use an advanced imaging technique to generate mechanistic data and de-risk the development of our candidates. Fibrosis is a chronic process, and it can take 6 months to a year to see a clinical benefit with a product candidate. We will utilize PET imaging to evaluate target engagement in patients and to determine if PLN-74809 is penetrating and having an effect in the tissues. We have an ongoing collaboration with Stanford pursuant to which we are evaluating Stanford’s αvβ6 PET ligand in IPF patients. We are using this ligand to evaluate the level of αvβ6 expression in the lungs of IPF patients, as well as to measure our product candidate’s ability to bind αvβ6. In addition to the αvβ6 PET ligand, Pliant has developed an αvβ1 PET tracer to evaluate the level of αvβ1 expression in fibrotic tissues, as well as to measure the ability of our product candidates to penetrate fibrotic tissues and bind to αvβ1. We filed an IND for this program in December 2020 and the FDA has since issued a “safe to proceed” letter. We plan to initiate clinical trials of our αvβ1 PET ligand as soon as possible. 
 Our product candidates
 PLN-74809 for the treatment of IPF and PSC
 Our lead product candidate, PLN-74809, is an oral small-molecule, dual-selective inhibitor of αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins which we are developing for the treatment of IPF and PSC. We have received orphan drug designation for PLN-74809 in both IPF and PSC. We completed a Phase 1a trial of PLN-74809 in healthy volunteers and a Phase 1b trial in which we assessed target engagement and proof-of-mechanism in healthy volunteers by examining the inhibition of TGF-ß activation in alveolar macrophages. We are recruiting two Phase 2a trials of PLN-74809 in IPF patients subject to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also recruiting a Phase 2a trial of PLN-74809 in PSC patients subject to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Phase 2a studies in IPF and PSC are enrolling up to 84 patients each, evaluating up to three dose cohorts of PLN-74809 or placebo. 
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis background
 IPF is a debilitating, age-related lung disease of unknown causes that has few treatment options. It is a form of progressive pulmonary fibrosis that leads to thickening and stiffening of the lung tissue resulting in the loss of lung function. As tissue scarring progresses, the lungs’ ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream becomes increasingly impaired. Average life expectancy at the 
 11

time of confirmatory diagnosis of IPF is estimated to be between three and four years. Approximately 60 to 80 percent of patients die within five years of diagnosis. These survival rates are worse than those of many late-stage cancers, such as stage 3 breast cancer.
 Patients with IPF experience debilitating symptoms, including shortness of breath and difficulty performing routine functions, such as walking and talking. Other symptoms include a chronic, dry, hacking cough; fatigue; weakness; discomfort in the chest; loss of appetite; and weight loss. IPF is a rare disease that affects approximately 140,000 people in the United States. There are an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 new cases diagnosed each year.
 Currently, there is no pharmacological cure for IPF and only a small proportion of late-stage IPF patients may be eligible for a lung transplant. The current non-transplant standard of care aims to slow the disease progression and improve the quality of life. Two therapies to treat IPF have recently been approved by the FDA: Esbriet® (pirfenidone), marketed by Genentech, and OFEV® (nintedanib), marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim. After decades during which the FDA approved no new treatments for IPF, the approvals of pirfenidone and nintedanib represented a major breakthrough for IPF patients. However, while these therapies may help slow the decline of lung function, neither drug has been shown to stop the progression of IPF. We believe that, despite the approval of pirfenidone and nintedanib by FDA, there remains an unmet need for IPF patients that we plan to address through our product candidate.
 Despite its mechanism of action being unknown, pirfenidone has been shown in registrational trials to have a modest effect on slowing the progression of IPF as measured by forced vital capacity, or FVC, in approximately fifteen percent of patients. Recent studies suggest that pirfenidone may have an impact on survival compared to placebo, but these results have not been confirmed. In March 2020, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for pirfenidone for treatment of unclassifiable lung fibrosis.
 Nintedanib is an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases that are receptors for growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF, fibroblast growth factor, or FGF, and vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF. Nintedanib reduced the rate of decline of pulmonary function in multiple trials by approximately half and led to significant delays in the time to acute disease exacerbation. While treatment was associated with a trend towards increased survival in registration trials, it has not been shown conclusively to have a survival benefit. Recent exploratory analyses from pooled data from six clinical trials of nintedanib suggest that nintedanib may extend life expectancy in patients with IPF. The FDA approved nintedanib for the treatment of lung fibrosis associated with systemic sclerosis in September 2019, and for the treatment of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease, or ILD with a progressive phenotype in March 2020.
 Elevated liver enzymes have been observed with both of these drugs, requiring monitoring of liver tests and potentially temporary dose reduction and discontinuation. Cases of drug-induced liver injury, including one fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with nintedanib. Pirfenidone’s prescribing information also carries a similar warning about elevated liver enzymes. Despite the remaining unmet need, combined sales of pirfenidone and nintedanib in 2019 were over $2.7 billion. IPF remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality and an area of high unmet medical need for which a commercial opportunity remains.
 Primary sclerosing cholangitis background
 PSC is a progressive liver disorder characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts which transport bile from the liver to the intestines. This type of fibrosis often results in obstruction or interruption of bile flow from the liver, a condition known as cholestasis, leading to liver fibrosis. Cirrhosis eventually develops and many individuals ultimately require a liver transplant. PSC patients are also at a higher risk of developing hepatobiliary cancers, including a 5 to 20 percent lifetime chance of developing cholangiocarcinoma, a typically rare form of cancer with an especially poor prognosis. The exact cause of PSC is unknown. PSC is normally diagnosed at middle age, with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 40 years old. The prevalence of PSC in the United States is estimated to be between 30,000 and 45,000 patients.
 In the absence of liver transplant, median survival of PSC patients is 10 to 12 years following diagnosis without intervention. There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for PSC. A number of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents have been studied in patients with PSC, but none has been conclusively proven to slow progression. Liver transplantation is the only available treatment for PSC patients; however, disease has been shown to recur in up to 20 percent of patients following transplantation.
 Our solution, PLN-74809
 PLN-74809 is a small-molecule that selectively inhibits both αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins that we are developing as a potential therapy for IPF and PSC. We have determined that TGF-ß activation in fibrosis associated with IPF and PSC involves both αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins. It has been shown that expression of both αvβ6 on epithelial cells and αvβ1 on fibroblasts can lead to excessive activation of TGF-ß in fibrosis. Epithelial tissue includes any tissue that lines the surfaces of the body such as alveoli, bile ducts, urinary tract, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Each of these tissues contains multiple cell types including epithelial cells and fibroblasts. An 
 12

important secondary effect of the TGF-ß cascade is that it promotes upregulation of αvβ1 on epithelial cells. The increased expression of these integrins on the cell surface contributes in turn to further TGF-ß activation in a TGF-ß-driven positive feed-forward loop.
 
 
Activation of TGF-ß by αvβ6 and αvβ1 leads to: • Activation of TGF-ß signaling pathways • Expression of pro-fibrotic genes including COL1A1 • Subsequent collagen production and deposition • Additional upregulation of αvβ6 

 
Epithelial tissue fibrosis is driven by two types of integrins
 Data from our lab, as well as scientific literature, have shown that αvβ6 and αvβ1 proteins are overexpressed in at least two different fibrosis indications: IPF and PSC. In lung tissue from IPF patients we and others have shown that alveolar epithelial cells have elevated αvβ6 expression, and that the level of over-expression correlates with disease severity. We have also shown that in these patients, αvβ1 expression is upregulated. In liver tissue from PSC patients, we have shown that αvβ6 is upregulated in cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts, and that αvβ1 is upregulated in whole fibrotic liver tissue. αvβ6 and αvβ1 are normally expressed at very low levels in healthy tissue making them ideal targets for selectively inhibiting TGF-ß activation in IPF and PSC.

 αvβ1 expression is upregulated in lung and liver fibrosis
 We have conducted a non-interventional clinical trial in IPF patients to assess the expression of integrin αvβ6 using a PET ligand. This trial confirmed that patients with IPF have high levels of integrin αvβ6 expression, which tend to be co-localized with fibrotic regions of the lungs. This trial was published in Nature Communications in 2019. The specificity of this PET ligand can be seen in images from an IPF patient who received a unilateral lung transplant. The PET ligand is only taken up in the diseased lung but not in the transplanted healthy lung.
 

Pulmonary αvβ6 PET ligand uptake in an IPF patient with a unilateral lung transplantation is confined to the IPF lung
 We have shown that inhibition of both αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins is required to maximally inhibit the expression of COL1A1, a key gene that encodes type I collagen, in models of lung and biliary fibrosis as well as in human IPF tissue. COL1A1 is a TGF-ß regulated gene that is expressed in fibrotic tissue. The expression level of COL1A1 correlates with the amount of collagen deposited as measured by the standard biochemical method of quantification of hydroxyproline, an amino acid that is a major component of collagen.

Clinical development of PLN-74809
 Phase 1 trials
 We completed an extended Phase 1a first-in-human, or FIH, SAD/MAD and food effect clinical trial of PLN-74809 in healthy volunteers. In the SAD portion of the trial, single doses of PLN-74809 were administered to 32 volunteers across four cohorts at doses of 15, 30, 50 and 75 mg. Eight additional volunteers in the SAD portion of the trial received placebo. In the MAD portion of the trial, PLN-74809 was administered orally to 27 volunteers, once-daily over 14 days at 10, 20, 40 mg. Six additional volunteers in the MAD portion of the trial received placebo. In the food effect part of the trial, PLN-74809 was administered to 12 volunteers, administered as a single dose with and without food. PLN-74809 was shown to be well tolerated with no dose-related adverse events. All but two adverse events reported in the entire trial were mild except for a moderate adverse event of dental abscess (SAD, 30 mg dose cohort) and a moderate adverse event of viral syndrome (MAD, 40 mg dose cohort). All adverse events resolved or recovered and no dose relationship for adverse events was observed. No notable findings were observed for laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, or ECG/telemetry.
 Since completing the Phase 1 FIH trial, we have conducted a Phase 1 extended dose escalation trial evaluating PLN-74809 at higher doses.  This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating safety and tolerability as well as PK in 80 healthy volunteers at single doses up to 320 mg and multiple doses up to 160 mg.  The PK profile of the higher dose cohorts remained in line with previous cohorts, and PLN-74809 remained well tolerated with no drug related severe adverse events or serious adverse events reported in either cohort.
 Participants with Drug Related Adverse Events in PLN-74809 in Phase 1a Trials


Additionally, PLN-74809 was well absorbed, and displayed a half-life of approximately 50 hours. PLN-74809 reached steady state plasma concentrations after seven days of dosing. Co-administration of PLN-74809 with food decreased drug concentrations relative to the fasted state, with AUC decreasing by approximately 40 percent and Cmax by approximately 50 percent.
 
15



We have also completed a Phase 1b proof-of-mechanism trial in healthy volunteers that was similar in design to our previously completed non-human primate mechanistic trial. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, ascending-dose, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate PLN-74809’s ability to inhibit TGF-ß activation in the lung as measured by pSMAD2 levels in pulmonary alveolar macrophages collected from bronchoalveolar lavage, or BAL, fluid and to further characterize the PK/PD relationship in humans. Additionally, this trial will serve to inform dosing in our planned Phase 2a trials. We conducted this trial in healthy volunteers due to the safety risks associated with performing multiple BAL procedures in IPF patients.
 We enrolled 18 volunteers across four dose cohorts (each cohort randomized 3:1 active to placebo). Two cohorts were dosed at 20 mg once daily and two cohorts were dosed at 40 mg once daily. Volunteers underwent an initial BAL procedure prior to treatment to measure baseline pSMAD levels. They were then treated with PLN-74809 or placebo for seven days, after which they underwent two additional BAL procedures to measure the amount of pSMAD reduction post-treatment at multiple time points. By utilizing two cohorts each for the 20 mg and 40 mg doses, we were able to measure pSMAD and drug levels at 4 different time points post treatment for each dose (3-, 6-, 12- and 24-hours post-dose on day 7), allowing assessment of PK/PD relationship over a 24-hour period.
 In the Phase 1b trial, 16 participants completed pre- and post-treatment BAL procedures. Four out of six participants (66%) receiving the high dose of PLN-74809 experienced mean reductions of 58.6% (6.9%) in pSMAD2 levels at six hours post-dose relative to baseline levels. Notably, all four of the volunteers in the high dose cohort with reductions in pSMAD2 levels also achieved plasma concentrations of PLN-74809 corresponding to the predicted plasma protein adjusted IC50 of 700 ng/ml. The two volunteers in the high dose cohort who did not achieve these concentrations did not experience reductions in pSMAD2 levels. In the low dose cohort, no volunteers achieved plasma protein adjusted IC50, and only one volunteer experienced significant reduction in pSMAD2 levels post treatment, relative to baseline levels. These results demonstrate PLN-74809’s effect on reducing TGF-ß activation in the 
 16

lungs in a dose- and exposure-dependent manner, supporting a PK/PD relationship in humans. These data support the biological activity of PLN-74809 and guided dose selection and trial design of our ongoing Phase 2a trials.
 

Treatment with PLN-74809 was well tolerated with no drug-related adverse events. None of the adverse events reported were observed in more than one participant. In the 40 mg dose cohort, two trial participants discontinued treatment prematurely (one participant receiving PLN-74809 and one receiving placebo) and did not undergo post-treatment BAL procedures; these participants were subsequently replaced.
 Adverse Events Reported by Participants Receiving PLN-74809 in Phase 1b Trial
 

As of December 2020, a total of 184 healthy volunteers have been exposed to PLN-74809 and 35 have been exposed to placebo in Phase 1 studies. The most common TEAEs in PLN-74809-treated volunteers were mild headache (12/184 [6.5%] participants) and mild constipation (6/184 [3.3%] participants).
 Current and planned clinical trials for IPF and PSC
 We are currently recruiting two Phase 2a trials of PLN-74809 in patients with IPF, subject to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first of these is an open-label trial utilizing a PET ligand to αvβ6 that allows imaging of target engagement by PLN-74809 in the lungs of IPF patients during treatment. Patients will receive a single dose of PLN-74809 across a dose range starting at 60 mg. We will obtain a PET scan at baseline to evaluate αvβ6 expression levels in the patients’ lungs and then initiate treatment with PLN-74809. A post-treatment PET scan will be performed at approximately three hours after administration of the dose, which will enable us to evaluate PLN-74809’s target engagement in patients’ lungs at maximum drug concentration. When PLN-74809 binds to the αvβ6 receptor, we would expect to see decreased PET ligand uptake in the lungs post-treatment when compared to pre-treatment levels. The relationship between dose and target engagement is important to confirm penetration of PLN-74809 into fibrotic tissue, establish a PK/PD relationship between PLN-74809 plasma exposure and αvβ6 target engagement, link biological activity shown in Phase 1b healthy volunteer BAL study to αvβ6 target engagement in IPF lungs and guide dose selection in future studies.
 
Pliant has developed a wholly owned PET tracer of the protein integrin of αvβ1. We filed an IND in December 2020, and the FDA has since issued a “safe to proceed” letter.  We plan to use this PET tracer to evaluate expression levels of αvβ1 in various fibrotic tissues.  Additionally, this tracer may allow us to evaluate tissue penetration and target engagement of developmental candidates that bind αvβ1, similar to the current Phase 2a PET trial we are running in IPF.  We expect to advance clinical trials of the integrin αvβ1 PET tracer as soon as possible.  
 17

Our second Phase 2a trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled IPF trial evaluating up to three doses of PLN-74809 in IPF patients. We plan to explore doses up to 160 mg per day at the highest dose. This is a 12-week trial evaluating safety and tolerability, as well as PK in IPF patients. We plan to evaluate exploratory endpoints including pulmonary function tests, biomarkers, and imaging, including Quantitative Lung Fibrosis HRCT imaging, or QLF. This is a multinational trial with approximately 60 sites in U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and multiple countries in Europe.
 12-Week Safety, PK, Biomarker Trial in IPF Patients
 

Design of 12-week Phase 2a IPF trial
 In our 12-week Phase 2a IPF trial, we will utilize QLF as a biomarker for early detection of changes in lung fibrosis. QLF is a fibrosis biomarker assessed using high resolution CT imaging, and utilizes quantitative image analysis to measure the density of lung tissue and quantify the volume of fibrosis present in the lung. QLF technology was developed by MedQIA, and has been evaluated in over 5,000 ILD patients, showing an ability to predict FVC decline in patients with IPF. While we will measure both endpoints, we believe QLF may allow us to detect changes in lung fibrosis in a more specific way than FVC.
 QLF has been utilized in recent clinical trials to evaluate early treatment effects in the amount of lung fibrosis present. In Biogen’s Phase 2a trial of BG00011, a mAb targeting αvβ6, dose-dependent trends in QLF were seen at 8 weeks, with the 1mg/kg cohort showing a decrease in the amount of fibrosis present with a r=-0.49 correlation to FVC.

Biogen’s Phase 2a 8-week QLF Results
 Additionally, FibroGen utilized FVC in their Phase 2 trial of pamrevlumab, their anti-CTGF mAb, in IPF. FibroGen showed 71% and 50% reductions in progression of fibrosis versus placebo at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively, as measured by QLF.
 

We are conducting a 12-week Phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of PLN-74809 in PSC patients. We are evaluating up to three cohort doses of PLN-74809 (40 mg, 80 mg, or 160 mg) or placebo. This is a multinational trial with approximately 60 sites in U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and multiple countries in Europe.
 
12 Week Safety, PK, Biomarker Trial in PSC Patients
 

19

Design of we week Phase 2a PSC trial
 The primary endpoints for our Phase 2a PSC trial will be safety and tolerability, as well as PK. We will also employ exploratory endpoints including fibrosis biomarkers including PRO-C3 and ELF, which are predictive of transplant-free survival in PSC patients, change in alkaline phosphatase, and liver imaging. Regulators have suggested that composite endpoints including biomarkers such as alkaline phosphatase, PRO-C3 and ELF coupled with liver histology may support approval in PSC. Both Gilead and Dr. Falk’s are including liver histology as a primary endpoint in their respective Phase 3 PSC trials. NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., or NGM, showed dose-dependent changes in PRO-C3 and ELF at 12 weeks in its Phase 2a PSC trial, with levels returning to baseline after the removal of treatment.
 

NGM ELF and Pro-C3 Data Over 12 Weeks of Treatment in PSC
 Other Potential Development Plans for PLN-74809 in Pulmonary and Hepatic Indications
 We are currently exploring the potential effects of PLN-74809 in fibrotic diseases outside of IPF and PSC and may choose to explore the development of PLN-74809 in additional indications in the future. For example, we believe PLN-74809 could provide anti-fibrotic benefits in several pulmonary and hepatic fibrosis diseases where there is over-expression of αvβ6, including pulmonary fibrosis associated with systemic sclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis associated with other forms of interstitial lung disease, primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC, biliary atresia and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, or PFIC. Additionally, we believe that PLN-74809 could provide anti-fibrotic benefits in the setting of end stage renal disease.
 PLN-74809 for Treatment of COVID-19 ARDS
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, is a major cause of mortality associated with COVID-19.  Research has shown that αvβ6 expression is elevated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients leading to increased TGF-ß levels. Increased TGF-ß levels in ARDS lead to epithelial cell death, alveolar and vascular leak, reduced interferon expression, increased immune cell infiltration, inhibition of sodium channel transport of fluid out of alveoli and fibroproliferation.
 By inhibiting αvβ6-mediated activation of TGF-ß in COVID-19 ARDS patients, we believe that in ARDS, PLN-74809 may be expected to reduce pulmonary edema by inhibition of αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation. 
 In the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a Phase 2a trial evaluating the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics, and exploratory clinical outcome measures of PLN-74809 across three dose cohorts or placebo in up to 36 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 diagnosed with ARDS.  With the availability of COVID-19 vaccines beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, as well as the increased and successful measures taken to contain the virus, we have observed a significant decrease in the number of severe and critical COVID-19 patients with ARDS.  Given the benefits that these vaccines have shown in preventing severe disease, it is unclear whether we will be able to complete enrollment of this trial.  As the pandemic evolves, we will continue to evaluate the feasibility of conducting this trial.  Should there be a continued decline in COVID-19 ARDS cases, we may consider investigating PLN-74809 in other forms of ARDS not related to COVID-19.

PLN-74809 reduced collagen gene expression in live human ILD lung tissue
 In an assay using live lung tissue from five patients with IPF, application of PLN-74809 for seven days led to significant decrease of >50% in expression of COL1A1, a key gene responsible for collagen production. The degree of inhibition observed with PLN-74809 approaching that of a complete blockade of TGF-ß signaling using a direct inhibitor of its TGF-ß type I receptor kinase, also known as ALK5. In contrast, an αvβ6-specific monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that we synthesized based on publicly available information regarding Biogen’s antibody, 3G9, was unable to significantly inhibit COL1A1 expression. In the same assay, using live lung tissue from a patient with systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary fibrosis, application of PLN-74809 for seven days also led to a decrease of >50% in expression of COL1A1.
 

Combined inhibition of αvβ6 and αvβ1 provided increased anti-fibrotic activity in live human fibrotic tissue as compared to DMSO vehicle control.
 pSMAD3 was correlated with extractable collagen levels in patients suspected of having IPF
 Open lung biopsies for histologic confirmation of IPF diagnosis were performed in 18 patients with interstitial lung disease, or ILD, who were suspected of having IPF. As part of this analysis, five controls (non-transplanted donor lungs) were also included. Multiple biopsies were taken from different lobes of each lung. Total pSMAD3 and extractable collagen 1 were measured by western 
 21

blot. Extractable collagen 1 is thought to be collagen that has been recently formed and has not been cross-linked to the extracellular matrix. Total pSMAD3 and extractable collagen were significantly correlated. Higher pSMAD3 levels corresponded to higher levels of recently produced collagen.
 

pSMAD3 levels are correlated with extractable collagen in lung biopsies from patients suspected of having IPF
 αvβ6 and αvβ1 expression is elevated in mouse bleomycin IPF model
 We used the increased expression of both αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins in human disease samples to select animal models with similar characteristics which we then employed for higher-throughput and more extensive testing than would be feasible with primary human tissue. The bleomycin model is the most extensively used model of IPF due to its ability to reproduce many aspects of the disease. The pattern of expression of integrins suggests that the bleomycin model can serve as a valid preclinical surrogate for evaluating the effects of integrin inhibition in IPF. We confirmed that both αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins are upregulated in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by exposure to bleomycin. In both acute and chronic versions of this model, expression of αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins were higher in bleomycin-exposed animals compared to healthy controls.
 

αvβ6 and αvβ1 expression in murine bleomycin model
 Dual αvβ6 and αvβ1 inhibition decreased collagen more than αvβ6 or αvβ1 single inhibition in live human IPF lung tissue
 To further understand the anti-fibrotic effect of single vs. dual integrin inhibition, we performed assays on live human lung tissue explanted from IPF patients during transplant. We incubated the samples for seven days with either a single selective αvβ1 small molecule inhibitor, a single selective αvβ6 inhibitor (αvβ6 mAb), or a dual selective αvβ6/αvβ1 inhibitor. Dual selective inhibition was accomplished with either PLN-74809 or a combination of the small molecule αvβ1 inhibitor and the αvβ6 mAb. In this assay, we also compared against an inhibitor of the TGF-ß receptor kinase ALK5, as a positive control. We measured effects on pro-fibrotic gene expression through the mRNA counts for COL1A1. The small molecule inhibitor of αvβ1 and the αvβ6 mAb, each dosed at 10x their IC50, failed to show a significant reduction in Col1a1 expression when administered individually. When the small molecule inhibitor of αvβ1 and the αvβ6 mAb were incubated as a combination therapy, COL1A1 expression was significantly reduced. PLN-74809 also showed a significant reduction in COL1A1 expression. We also evaluated gene expression across a broad panel of additional pro-
 22

fibrotic genes. Similar to COL1A1, dual inhibition resulted in a greater reduction in gene expression across the panel versus single inhibition.

 PLN-74809 showed a dose-dependent reduction in collagen fiber density in a mouse bleomycin IPF model
 We evaluated three doses of PLN-74809 in a mouse bleomycin IPF model utilizing second-harmonic generation to evaluate the amount of new collagen formation ongoing post-treatment with PLN-74809. We evaluated a range of doses against vehicle control and saw a dose dependent reduction in collagen fiber density and fibrosis composite score.
 

PLN-74809 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in collagen fiber density in a mouse bleomycin IPF model as measured through second-harmonic generation
 PLN-74809 decreased TGF-ß activation in chronic bleomycin mouse model
 We confirmed through biochemical analyses that anti-fibrotic efficacy of PLN-74809 in the bleomycin model was due to blockade of TGF-ß activation. A key biochemical marker of TGF-ß activation is the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. In the bleomycin model, two weeks of treatment with PLN-74809 reduced pSMAD3 levels in a dose-dependent manner to those seen in control mice that had not been exposed to bleomycin in the acute IPF model. In addition, levels of newly formed collagen, or neo-collagen, and total lung collagen as measured by hydroxyproline content were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the treatment group.

PLN-74809 blocked TGF-ß activation in a chronic bleomycin model
 The ability to measure TGF-ß activation through SMAD phosphorylation also provided us with the opportunity to develop SMAD2/3 phosphorylation as a biomarker that correlates with αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrin inhibition.
 Inhibition of αvβ6 and αvβ1 blocked TGF-ß activation in the pulmonary cells of non-human primates
 We conducted a non-human primate study to validate pSMAD as a biomarker for TGF-ß activation for future clinical studies. Given that this study will not be part of our regulatory package for our lead compound, PLN-74809, we used PLN-75068, a close analog to PLN-74809, with a similar binding and PK profile for this particular study. In the first stage of this study, we treated non-human primates with PLN-75068 twice daily, or with the αvβ6 mAb at 1 mg/kg every other day for seven days. We performed BAL procedures on the monkeys pre- and post- treatment and measured pSMAD2 levels in the pulmonary macrophages. BAL fluid collected three hours after dosing showed a significant reduction of pSMAD2 levels when compared to pre-treatment levels. The αvβ6 mAb showed pSMAD2 level reduction as well, but the effect was less pronounced than for PLN-75068.
 

BID Dosing of PLN-75068 reduced pSMAD2 levels in non-human primate alveolar fluid
 A second stage of this study was designed to evaluate the PK/PD relationship between PLN-75068 and the inhibition of TGF-ß activation. In this stage, we dosed monkeys at either a low or high dose once a day for seven days. We designed the study to obtain multiple BAL measurements after the last treatment in order to understand how changes in the pSMAD2 levels relate to serum levels of PLN-75068. Dosing of PLN-75068 in non-human primates showed a decrease in the pSMAD2 levels at both doses. Soon after dosing, when drug concentrations were at their peak, the levels of pSMAD2 levels showed a reduction of more than 75 percent. As the drug concentration decreased, pSMAD2 levels gradually returned to baseline levels. Importantly, both dosing groups resulted in 
 24

similar levels of pSMAD2 level reduction; however, the higher dose stayed in the effective dose range longer, and therefore maintained pSMAD2 level reduction for a longer period.

 PLN-74809 binds to all conformations of αvβ6 and αvβ1 in biochemical assays
 Integrins are cellular adhesion proteins having a high degree of structural flexibility with two predominant forms: an extended form with high affinity for binding to ligands, and a bent or closed form in which the ligand binding domain has low affinity for binding to ligands. The conformation of the integrin can also dramatically alter the binding of potential therapeutics such as antibodies.
 Biochemical profiling of PLN-74809 confirms that it can inhibit both αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins in both the high-affinity, extended open conformation as well as in the lower-affinity, bent closed conformation and thus has the potential to block integrin interactions regardless of the initial state of the receptor.

αvβ6 and αvβ1 are overexpressed in human PSC liver tissue as well as a mouse model of PSC
 Similar to our approach in diseased tissue from an IPF patient, we examined the expression patterns of integrins in live, diseased tissue obtained from a patient with PSC. We found that both αvβ6 and αvβ1 integrins are overexpressed in these tissues. We then went to the standard animal model for PSC based on a deletion of the Mdr2 gene in mice and confirmed that in this model both αvβ6 and αvβ1 are overexpressed compared to normal control mice.

 PLN-74809 decreased COL1A1 expression in live human PSC and PBC liver tissue samples more than OCA
 We assessed the anti-fibrotic activity of our integrin inhibitors using liver samples obtained from a PSC patient and a PBC patient. We used to precision-cut tissue slices to establish ex vivo tissue culture samples that mimic the multicellular characteristics of organs. The use of these precision-cut tissue culture assays not only provides the opportunity to assess the effects of our compounds directly on diseased human tissue, but also allows this to be done in a three-dimensional, multicellular context that better represents the complexity of the diseased tissue environment.

 Live tissue samples from a PSC patient and a PBC patient were incubated for two days with varying concentrations of PLN-74809 and obeticholic acid, or OCA, a drug approved for the treatment of PBC. Incubation with PLN-74809 led to a significant dose-dependent decrease of COL1A1 expression, while incubation with OCA did not.

 PLN-1474 and NASH
 PLN-1474 is a selective inhibitor of αvβ1 integrin that we are developing for the treatment of liver fibrosis in patients with NASH. PLN-1474 is an orally bioavailable inhibitor that has shown anti-fibrotic activity in multiple animal models of liver fibrosis as well as in live human NASH fibrotic liver tissue. In October 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Novartis under which Novartis received global rights to develop and commercialize PLN-1474 the treatment of NASH associated liver fibrosis. We have completed a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 dose escalation trial of PLN-1474 that enrolled 84 healthy volunteers across single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose cohorts. Results showed that PLN-1474 was well tolerated with no dose- or treatment-limiting toxicities with adverse events that were mostly mild with no severe or serious adverse events observed. Per our licensing and collaboration agreement, all development expenses associated with the Phase 1 trial are reimbursed by Novartis. The PLN-1474 IND application was transferred to Novartis in the first quarter of 2021. 
 Background on liver fibrosis and NASH
 NASH is a severe form of NAFLD that is associated with the development of liver fibrosis and potentially life-threatening liver dysfunction. NAFLD is characterized by increased amounts of fat in the liver, or steatosis. NAFLD is believed to occur due to a combination of factors including high caloric diet, obesity and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus and genetics. Early stages of the disease often have no symptoms other than slightly elevated or fluctuating levels of liver enzymes in some patients.
 As excess fat builds up in the liver, it can eventually cause lipotoxicity, resulting in inflammation in the liver and leading to injury of hepatocytes, known as ballooning. It is this combination of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning that defines NASH. Over time, NASH can lead to fibrosis of the liver. Fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, resulting in impaired liver function and increased risk of liver-related complications and mortality. In fact, liver fibrosis is an independent predictor of liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in NASH. There are currently no FDA approved therapies for NASH, and to date investigational NASH therapies have only shown modest anti-fibrotic benefits in published clinical trials.
 It is estimated that 30 to 40 percent of adults in the United States have NAFLD and approximately 30 percent of these patients, or up to 12 percent of adults, will develop NASH. NASH is already highly prevalent, affecting approximately 16.5 million adults in the United States with approximately 3.3 million at stage F3/F4 liver fibrosis. NASH is a growing problem with U.S. cases expected to top 27 million by 2030, with approximately eight million at stage F3/F4 liver fibrosis.
 While NASH is becoming more common in the general population, identifying patients with increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality is important for clinical management. While steatosis, inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning are the measures used to diagnose NASH, to date, the presence and severity of liver fibrosis is the only proven independent predictor of poor clinical outcomes in NASH. Cirrhosis associated with NASH is the fastest growing indication for liver transplantation in the United States.
 28

Approximately 10 to 15 percent of NASH patients will ultimately progress to cirrhosis over time. On average, these patients advance one fibrosis stage every seven years. NASH patients, regardless of stage of fibrosis, have an estimated annual mortality rate of 1.5 to 3.5 percent per year, mostly due to cardiovascular complications. However, when patients progress to stage F2 fibrosis or greater, liver-related complications become the highest risk for mortality. Each progressive stage of fibrosis correlates to a dramatic increase in liver-related mortality risk. Moreover, patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis carry liver-related mortality risk that is 17 times and 42 times greater, respectively, than NASH patients without fibrosis. We believe treatments with a potent anti-fibrotic effect would be more likely to have a meaningful impact on clinical outcomes for NASH patients with F3 to F4 fibrosis.
 

Stages of liver fibrosis
 There are currently no FDA approved therapies for the treatment of NAFLD or NASH. Lifestyle changes and exercise to reduce body weight and treatment of concomitant diabetes and dyslipidemia comprise the cornerstone of treatment but are not sustainable in the majority of patients. For patients with cirrhosis, liver transplantation is the only potential treatment option, but transplant livers are not widely available, and only a minority of these patients will be eligible for a transplant due to the risks, costs and complexities associated with the procedure. NASH is the second leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States but is also the most rapidly growing indication and is expected to eventually overtake alcoholic liver disease as the largest driver of liver transplant.
 There are many candidates in development for the treatment of NASH that target various aspects of the disease. A number of these candidates are directed at reducing the underlying causes of the disease such as obesity and diabetes or addressing fat accumulation in the liver by altering lipid metabolism. Other candidates are focused on suppressing the inflammatory stage of NASH with the intent of preventing the progression of fibrosis. To date, only modest improvements in liver fibrosis stage or severity have been reported with investigational compounds evaluated in patients with NASH. Our approach is to directly target the fibrosis pathway with the goal of preventing progression or reversing advanced fibrosis (F3/F4). Given TGF-ß’s central role to fibrosis pathophysiology, we believe that directly targeting the TGF-ß activation pathway via αvβ1 integrin inhibition holds the potential to provide a more clinically meaningful anti-fibrotic effect than current investigational therapies, and ultimately prevent disease progression to cirrhosis and liver related complications.
 Our solution, PLN-1474
 PLN-1474 is a bioavailable, small-molecule, selective inhibitor of αvβ1 mediated TGF-ß activation. PLN-1474 is an anti-fibrotic therapy for patients with liver fibrosis associated with NASH. We have shown that in human fibrotic liver tissue from patients with NASH that the levels of αvβ1 are significantly elevated in tissue from patients with stage 4 fibrotic disease. Overexpression of αvβ1 is correlated with TGF-ß activation as measured by pSMAD3 levels. Therefore, we believe a single-selective inhibitor of αvβ1 is a promising and differentiated approach to treating NASH associated liver fibrosis. In October of 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Novartis through which Novartis obtained a global license to PLN-1474. We have completed a Phase 1 trial of PLN-1474 in healthy volunteers with Novartis reimbursing us for all associated development activities. The program has been transferred to Novartis, in the first quarter of 2021, who be responsible for all future development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities.

αvβ1 and TGF-ß activation are upregulated in human F4 NASH liver biopsies
 We measured αvβ1 protein expression and pSMAD3 levels in a group of late-stage liver fibrosis biopsies. In F4 biopsies, αvβ1 was significantly overexpressed relative to F0/F1 biopsies. Similarly, the pSMAD3 levels were also significantly elevated in F4 biopsies compared to F0/F1.
 

αvβ1 and pSMAD3 levels are both upregulated in F4 liver fibrosis
 PLN-1474 is associated with anti-fibrotic activity in live human fibrotic NASH liver tissue
 We assessed the anti-fibrotic activity of PLN-1474 in live human NASH liver tissue. Precision cut tissue slices from multiple F4 NASH livers treated with PLN-1474 exhibited a mean 50 percent reduction in the levels of COL1A1 expression compared to vehicle treated controls. In the PLN-1474 treated tissue slices, we also saw a significant reduction in the gene expression of TIMP1, which encodes the tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase, or TIMP-1. In a recent study, TIMP-1 was shown to be a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with fibrosis. TIMP-1 is one of the three components of the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis, or ELF, score, a non-
 30

invasive clinical diagnostic test to assess the likelihood of having clinically significant fibrosis. These results suggest that selective inhibition of αvβ1 could have clinically meaningful anti-fibrotic activity in NASH patients with advanced fibrosis.

 31

PLN-1474 showed dose-dependent reduction of fibrosis in NASH and liver fibrosis mouse models
 We tested the ability of PLN-1474 to inhibit fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH induced by a choline-deficient high fat diet. Treatment of these mice for six weeks, beginning at week five of the high fat diet, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in collagen production as measured by hydroxyproline levels compared to vehicle-treated controls. Similar dose-dependent decreases in the expression of Col1a1 genes and picrosirius red staining, a histologic marker for fibrosis, were observed after treatment with PLN-1474. Treatment with PLN-1474 also led to decreases in pSMAD3 levels indicating that PLN-1474 was able to block TGF-ß activation.
 
PLN-1474 inhibits fibrosis in NASH fibrosis model
 PLN-1474 also inhibited fibrosis in an acute CCl4 model of liver fibrosis. In this model, liver fibrosis in mice is induced by two weeks of exposure to CCl4. Treatment with PLN-1474 for one week reduced the expression of Col1a1, Col1a2 and Col3a1 compared to vehicle-treated controls. Treatment with PLN-1474 also reduced TGF-ß signaling to baseline levels as measured by pSMAD3 levels.
 In the chronic version of the CCL4 model, fibrosis is induced by 21 days of exposure to CCl4. Treatment of these mice with PLN-1474 resulted in significant reductions in the expression of collagen genes beginning as soon as two hours after dosing. These results suggest that PLN-1474 has the potential to lead to significant and rapid changes in fibrosis even in livers containing extensive and established fibrotic lesions.

PLN-1474 decreased collagen fiber density and characteristics via second-harmonic generation analysis in a NASH fibrosis model
 We evaluated three doses of PLN-1474 in a NASH fibrosis mouse model utilizing second-harmonic generation to evaluate the amount of new collagen formation ongoing post-treatment with PLN-1474. We evaluated a range of doses against placebo in a NASH fibrosis model and saw a dose-dependent reduction in collagen fiber density and fibrosis composite score.

 PLN-1474 potently binds to all conformations of αvβ1
 Similar to our observations with PLN-74809, we have shown that PLN-1474 binds to both the higher-affinity, extended open conformation of integrin αvβ1 as well as the lower-affinity, bent closed conformation and thus has the potential to block integrin interactions regardless of the state of the receptor.
 Clinical development of PLN-1474
 We have completed a Phase 1 first-in-human trial of PLN-1474 in healthy volunteers. The trial of PLN-1474 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial that enrolled 84 healthy volunteers across single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose cohorts evaluating safety and tolerability as well as PK. Results showed that PLN-1474 was rapidly absorbed and generally well tolerated with no dose- or treatment-limiting toxicities. Adverse events were mostly mild with no severe or serious adverse events observed. In preclinical studies, PLN-1474 was observed to selectively block the αvβ1 integrin mediated activation of TGF-β, reducing fibrosis in the liver. The PLN-1474 IND application was transferred to Novartis in the first quarter of 2021. Novartis will be responsible for all future development, manufacturing and commercialization activities.
 Applying our fibrosis expertise in developing additional products
 We are pursuing potential uses of our existing product candidates, PLN-74809 and PLN-1474, in additional fibrotic indications. We use our precision cut human fibrotic tissue assays in addition to our animal model data to inform our clinical development programs and potentially select additional indications where we think our pipeline candidates could have an effect.
 Our mission is to advance the understanding of fibrosis by building a biology-, chemistry- and screening-based engine to drive drug development across the spectrum of fibrotic diseases. While our initial focus is on small-molecule integrin inhibitors in lung and liver fibrosis, we are actively pursuing additional treatment modalities across fibrosis indications in multiple different organs. We have identified other potential non-integrin targets related to TGF-ß signaling as well as other pathways across multiple fibrosis indications, such as regulators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a critical process in fibrosis. In addition, while our initial focus is on small-molecule drug candidates, we are agnostic to treatment modalities in the development of our pipeline.
 Our oncology program-TGF-ß signaling in the tumor microenvironment
 Over the past several years, the checkpoint inhibitor class of immuno-oncology drugs has changed the way many cancers are treated. Checkpoint inhibitors work to block signals that prevent the body’s immune system from recognizing tumor cells. By blocking checkpoint signals such as PD-1, these drugs have the ability to sensitize T-cells, allowing them to recognize and kill tumor cells. While checkpoint inhibitors have led to dramatic improvements in survival rates for certain cancer indications, there are still a significant proportion of patients who do not respond to the drugs. Much effort is being devoted to understanding the root causes of checkpoint inhibitor resistance.
 33

As TGF-ß biology has been elucidated, it has become increasingly understood in the scientific literature that TGF-ß plays an important anti-inflammatory role in the tumor microenvironment. One of TGF-ß’s core physiologic roles is an anti-inflammatory effect that it provides in the wound healing process. In the tumor microenvironment, however, certain integrins, such as αvβ8, can be overexpressed on multiple different cell types, resulting in increased activation, and signaling of TGF-ß. This over activation of TGF-ß can lead to a strong anti-inflammatory effect in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in decreased T-cell infiltration and decreased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as granzyme B and interferon g. This mechanism is becoming increasingly recognized as a potential cause of the resistance to checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 therapies seen in many tumors. We are targeting TGF-ß activating integrins such as avß8 that are upregulated in certain tumors with the goal of removing the anti-inflammatory effect and, ultimately, sensitizing tumors to checkpoint inhibitors. This program has generated positive data in preclinical tumor models and our candidate is currently undergoing IND-enabling studies.
 
Integrin Upregulation in the Tumor Microenvironment
 We are developing small molecule inhibitors against αvβ8 as well as other TGF-ß-activating integrins that have been shown to be upregulated in the tumor microenvironment. We have shown in an EMT6 anti-PD-1 resistant tumor mouse model that our small molecule inhibitors of αvβ8-mediated TGF-ß activation are able to sensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy and extend survival. Additionally, our molecules perform similarly to monoclonal antibodies against the αvβ8 integrin receptor.

Our Muscular Dystrophy Program
 Muscular Dystrophy comprises a group of inherited diseases, all characterized by inborn errors in dystrophin, a protein that anchors muscle cells to the extracellular matrix, or ECM, and facilitates contraction of skeletal muscles. Mutations in the gene that codes for dystrophin can cause the dystrophin protein to be misshapen and ineffective in anchoring the muscle cell to the extracellular matrix. The lack of dystrophin anchoring results in damage to skeletal muscle cells upon contraction. Over time, muscle cells are unable to regenerate, and are eventually replaced by fat and fibrosis, resulting in loss of muscle function. Severe forms of muscular dystrophy cause progressive weakening of the heart and diaphragm, leading to death.
 The most common form of muscular dystrophy is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, which affects 1 in 3,500 boys worldwide. Disease progression varies, usually presenting with muscle weakness around age four. Most DMD patients need a wheelchair by age 12, with most dying in their 20’s. DMD is caused by mutations to the DMD gene, which codes for dystrophin.
 Treatment for DMD is mostly focused on mitigating the symptoms. Aggressive management of dilated cardiomyopathy with anti-congestive medications is used, including cardiac transplantation in severe cases. Assistive devices for respiratory complications may be needed, especially at night. The steroid prednisone is given to improve the strength and function of individuals with DMD. Prednisone has been shown to prolong the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. While a new treatment, etiplirsen, was recently approved in a subset of patients, this remains an area of tremendous unmet medical need. There are a number of novel modalities such as gene therapy and CRISPR being explored as potential treatments for DMD, but they remain years from approval.
 We have identified a target integrin receptor that acts as a natural compensatory mechanism that anchors the muscle cell to the ECM in DMD, as well as other types of muscular dystrophy. It is expressed on the surface of skeletal muscle cells and has been shown to be upregulated in patients with muscular dystrophy. The target integrin is able to bind to laminin in the ECM and serve as a substitute for the dystrophin complex that normally holds muscle cells to the ECM. This compensatory mechanism serves to stabilize the muscle cell membrane, which decreases muscle damage upon contraction. Moreover, mutations in this integrin, or in the laminin protein that it binds to, have been reported, and result in congenital myopathies with phenotypes similar to those of muscular dystrophy. Like other integrins, our integrin target can exist in various conformations, some of which are active, and others that are not. The natural compensatory ability of the target is limited by the number of integrin receptors in the active conformation at any given time.
 

35

Our muscular dystrophy program utilizes an allosteric, agonistic, monoclonal antibody which binds to the alpha subunit of the target integrin and stabilizes it in its active conformation. By maximizing the number of target integrins that are active, the mAb is designed to increase the overall binding of the muscle cell membrane to the ECM and to stabilize the membrane.

Allosteric agonistic monoclonal antibody binds to the inactive integrin inducing conformational change increasing laminin binding
 We have developed a humanized antibody that is highly potent and selective for the alpha subunit of the target integrin. Our mAb candidate has been tested in an mdx /DBA2 DMD mouse model where it showed significantly decreased muscle damage as measured through clinical biomarkers including serum creatinine kinase and troponin.
 
Treatment with mAb resulted in decreased muscle damage in a mdx/DBA2 mouse model

 36

In addition to protecting against muscle damage, the antibody showed an increase in diaphragm contractility in the mice tested. The antibody was able to return diaphragm contractility to near the same level as the wild type controls. This is crucial, given that the primary cause of death in patients with muscular dystrophy is cardiopulmonary failure resulting from progressive wasting of cardiac and respiratory muscles.
 
Agonistic mAb restored diaphragm force back to the same level as wild type control
 The antibody protected the gastrocnemius muscle from eccentric injury in which the muscle loses contractile force over a series of contractions. Interestingly, mice treated with an antibody that blocks the integrin receptor showed an increase in eccentric injury.
 
Integrin Agonistic Antibody Protected Gastrocnemius Muscle from Eccentric Injury While Antagonistic Antibody Increased Injury

 37

Lastly, our mAb showed a reduction in hydroxyproline levels in the gastrocnemius muscles of the test mice, suggesting less fibrosis in the muscles, possibly as a result of decreased muscle damage.
 
Agonistic mAb significantly reduced collagen content in gastrocnemius muscles of treated mice
 We have nominated a development candidate and are currently conducting CMC scale-up activities. We plan to initiate IND enabling studies in 2021.
 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant industry-wide delays in clinical trials. There are multiple causes of these delays, including reluctance of patients to enroll or continue in trials for fear of exposure to coronavirus, local and regional shelter-in-place orders and regulations that discourage, hamper, or prohibit patient visits, healthcare providers and health systems shifting away from clinical trials toward the acute care of COVID-19 patients and the FDA and other regulators making product candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 a priority over product candidates unrelated to the pandemic.
 We are working closely with our contract research organizations, or CRO’s, manufacturers, investigators, and clinical trial sites to monitor and assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on timelines and expected costs for each of our programs. Our CRO’s are largely decentralized organizations and, to date, have not experienced significant impacts to their ability to support our trials. Our manufacturers, particularly in China, have, to varying degrees, experienced impacts to their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, however, these operational challenges have had minimal impact on their ability to produce and deliver materials to us in a timely manner.
 We are in close contact with each of our more than 60 global clinical trial sites per program (i.e., IPF and PSC) to monitor and assess the local and regional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to adjust the conduct of our clinical trials accordingly. The pandemic resulted in significant closures of many of our trial sites over the course of 2020.  We estimate that the closures caused delays of 4-6 months to the overall timelines for the IPF and PSC trials.  To mitigate these effects, in 2020, we focused on opening additional sites and conducting an awareness campaign to generate interest in our trials. The ongoing campaign includes clinical research site calls with our founders and KOLs, engagement with scientific and patient communities and foundations, and active social media channels.
 People living with IPF are considered at higher risk for developing serious illness if they become infected by the coronavirus. These patients may be instructed to avoid non-essential visits to medical centers, and to instead self-isolate at home. We have successfully implemented a hybrid approach to clinical trial participation with home-health solutions for both our IPF and PSC clinical trials designed to minimize the requirements for visits to healthcare facilities in order to mitigate COVID-19 infection risk in these vulnerable populations. 
 Our pipeline and early-stage programs have been impacted and may be further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to local California shelter-in-place orders in effect intermittently since March 2020. These impacts have been mitigated by our ability to outsource work, such as CMC, to third parties. Additionally, we are subject to certain exceptions to the shelter-in-place orders through 
 38

the nature of our early-stage research and expect to continue to conduct essential lab work utilizing social distancing measures such as alternating shifts and reduced staff on site, as necessary. 
 We are not aware of any of our directors or employees being infected with coronavirus, but the virus can remain asymptomatic for a significant period of time and methods and availability of testing continue to evolve. Notwithstanding the current shelter-in-place orders, our employees or their family members could become infected.
 We note the high level of difficulty in projecting the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our programs and our company, given the rapid and dramatic evolution in the course and impact of the pandemic and the societal and governmental response to it.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition, and an emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific personnel provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from many different sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies with greater resources. Smaller specialty biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies, as well as public and private institutions are also potential sources of competitive products and technologies, including through collaborative arrangements with large and established biopharmaceutical companies. We also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients for clinical trials, and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, convenience, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
 There are a number of large biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are currently pursuing the development of products for the treatment of fibrosis. Companies that we are aware of that are targeting the treatment of various fibrosis indications through inhibiting various parts of the TGF-ß pathway include large companies with significant financial resources such as Biogen, Inc., AbbVie Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Indalo Therapeutics, Inc., FibroGen, Inc., Galapagos NV, Bristol Myers Squibb Co., and Novartis AG. However, we know of no other companies currently in clinical development with an orally bioavailable small-molecule, selective integrin inhibitor.
 Prior to February 2021, Galapagos’s Phase 3 autotaxin inhibitor GLPG-1690 and Fibrogen’s Phase 3 monoclonal antibody against connective tissue growth factor, or CTGF, were the two most advanced development candidates for treatment of IPF. Galapagos terminated both of its Phase 3 trials of GLPG-1690 in IPF in February 2021 due to an unfavorable benefit-risk profile.
 Although our novel approach is unique from most other existing or investigational therapies across the disease areas where we are focusing our development, we will need to compete with currently approved therapies, and potentially those in currently in development if they are approved. We are aware of several marketed and investigational products in our leading disease areas, including but not limited to:
  
• | IPF: There are currently two approved products for the treatment of IPF; Esbriet, marketed by Roche Holding AG, and Ofev, marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH. Companies currently developing product candidates in IPF include AbbVie, Galapagos, Kadmon Holdings, Inc., Galecto Biotech, Inc., Roche Holding AG and Liminal BioSciences. Inc.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PSC: There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of PSC. Companies currently developing product candidates in PSC include Gilead Sciences, Inc., AbbVie Inc., Dr. Falk Pharma and Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NASH: There are currently no FDA approved therapies for the treatment of NASH. There are a number of companies developing product candidates for the treatment of NASH including Intercept, Pfizer Inc., Gilead, AbbVie, Novartis, AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly & Company, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Amgen, Inc., BMS, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Roche, Sanofi S.A., Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk, Genfit SA, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Inc., Cirius Therapeutics, Inc., NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Akero Therapeutics, Inc. and Metacrine, Inc. Most of the drugs currently in development for NASH are focused on decreasing liver fat or improving liver inflammation as opposed to direct liver anti-fibrotic approaches.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our product candidates, if approved for marketing. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Intellectual Property
 Overview
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of fibrosis that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions, where available.
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents, or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, enforcement of these rights may depend on third party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 As of March 1, 2021, we own, co-own or license over 115 pending patent applications worldwide in over 19 patent families, including United States and corresponding foreign patent applications. To date, three U.S. patents have issued to us. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek United States and foreign patent protection for a variety of technologies, including, research compounds and methods, candidate compounds and antibodies for modulating the activity of integrins, methods for treating diseases of interest, and methods for manufacturing our products. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various other license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development.
 Company Owned IP
 We own multiple families of patent applications that are directed to small-molecule compositions capable of modulating integrins and methods for treating or preventing diseases associated with integrins. Certain applications in these families relate to our PLN-1474 and PLN-74809 small-molecule product candidates, backup compounds and structural analogs, various unit dosages, dosing regimens, and routes of administration. We are also pursuing innovative ways to modulate integrin function using antibodies and have one pending patent application to that technology in the United States. Patents that may issue from these company owned applications are generally expected to expire between the years 2037 to 2041, subject to possible patent term adjustment and/or extension.
Trademark Protection
 We have two registered U.S. trademarks for use in connection with our products. We may pursue additional registrations for future products in markets of interest.
 Trade Secret Protection
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process development, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.

License Agreements
 Novartis Collaboration and License Agreement
 In October 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, with Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc., or Novartis, for the research, development, and commercialization of PLN-1474, and up to three additional integrin targets, or the Research Targets. Under the terms of the Novartis Agreement, we will be responsible for the clinical development and manufacture of PLN-1474 through the first-in-human study and Novartis will then be responsible for all future development, manufacturing, and commercialization. Following the completion of our Phase 1 clinical trial for PLN-1474, the PLN-1474 IND was transferred to Novartis in the first quarter of 2021.
 During the research term, which shall initially be three years and extendable, we will collaborate, through a joint steering committee, with Novartis on up to three separate research programs, to biologically validate certain potential Research Targets and identify and synthesize potential research compounds for each Research Target in accordance with the applicable research plan. We will be responsible for advancing product candidates targeting selected Research Targets to development candidate stage and Novartis will then be responsible for all future development, manufacturing, and commercialization.
 We have also granted to Novartis an (i) exclusive (even as to us), transferable, sublicensable license to certain of our technology to commercialize licensed products in the field and (ii) co-exclusive (with us), transferable, sublicensable license to research, develop and manufacture certain licensed compounds and licensed products for disease treatment worldwide. Upon the completion of the first Phase 1 study, such co-exclusive license shall become exclusive for Novartis.
 In addition, pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we have granted to Novartis and its affiliates an (i) exclusive (even as to us), transferable, sublicensable license to certain of our technology to commercialize certain research products in the field and (ii) a coexclusive (with us), transferable, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain selected research compounds and research products for disease treatment worldwide. Upon the selection of relevant candidate small molecule compound selective modulator, such co-exclusive license shall become exclusive for Novartis.
 Novartis paid us a nonrefundable, non-creditable one-time payment of $50.0 million as an initial license fee in October 2019. Novartis will also pay us a $4.0 million target validation fee for each candidate target that achieves target validation and is deemed a research target, for up to three candidate targets.
 Novartis shall also pay us certain development and commercialization milestone payments, in total up to $416.0 million under the agreement.
 Novartis shall also pay us tiered royalties, on a product-by-product basis based on annual nets sales of products at percentages ranging from high-single digits to low teens of the applicable licensed products and mid-single digits to high-single digits for any products resulting from the research programs.
 Unless earlier terminated, the Novartis Agreement will expire upon the expiration of all royalty obligations. The royalty period will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) ten years from the first commercial sale, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory or data exclusivity and (iii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim. Novartis has the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement for convenience on a target-by-target basis upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, so long as such right is exercised prior to the first commercial sale of any licensed product or research product with respect to the applicable target. After the first commercial sale, Novartis has the right to terminate the Novartis Agreement for convenience on a target-by-target basis upon six (6) months’ prior written notice. We may not terminate the agreement for convenience. Either we or Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement if the other party is in material breach and such breach is not cured within the specified cure period. In addition, either we or Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. If we terminate the agreement as a result of Novartis’ uncured material breach or Novartis terminates at will, we retain a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to certain Novartis technology in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain compounds and products as set forth in the Novartis Agreement, subject to certain conditions.
 Adimab Collaboration Agreement
 In October 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement, or the Adimab Agreement, with Adimab, LLC, or Adimab, for the discovery and optimization of proprietary antibodies as potential therapeutic product candidates. Under the Adimab Agreement, we have initially agreed with Adimab to collaborate on an initial research program. In addition, we may select up to three additional biological targets against which Adimab will use its technology to research and develop antibodies pursuant to a mutually agreed upon research plan.
 During the ongoing research period and for a specified evaluation period thereafter, or the Evaluation Term, Adimab will grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive license to Adimab’s technology to perform our responsibilities under the specified research plan and to 
 41

evaluate the program antibodies to determine, at our election, how to proceed with any antibodies discovered as a result of such research program.
 On a research program by research program basis, Adimab has granted to us an exclusive option to acquire the rights to up to a certain specified number of discovered antibodies for development and commercialization as biopharmaceutical products. We have also granted Adimab a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license under our technology during each research program, and during the relevant Evaluation Term solely to perform Adimab’s responsibilities under such research plan.
 Upon execution of the Adimab Agreement we paid to Adimab a one-time, non-creditable non-refundable technology access fee in the low-five figures. For each agreed upon research program that is commenced, we are required to pay Adimab an agreed upon rate for its full-time employees during a given research program, a specified discovery delivery fee, and an optimization completion fee in the low-six figures.
 If we choose to exercise our option with respect to a specific research program, we are required to pay Adimab a non-creditable, non-refundable high six-figure option exercise fee, payable in installments. If we exercise our option with respect to more than the specified number of antibodies resulting from such research program, we are obligated to make an additional specified payment for each additional optioned antibody. To date, we have not exercised any options under the Adimab Agreement.
 We are required to make certain milestone payments to Adimab upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestone events in the development of therapeutic products and diagnostic products which use the antibodies we have obtained pursuant to our exclusive option. The milestone payments total approximately $12 million for each therapeutic product. For any product that is commercialized pursuant to the Adimab Agreement, we are required to pay Adimab low single digit percentage tiered royalty payments based on annual aggregate worldwide net sales thresholds for such products, subject to reduction as specified in the Adimab Agreement. Royalty terms with respect to each product will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (a) ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (b) the expiration of the last patent related to any antibody acquired by us pursuant to our option from a specified research program.
 Under the Adimab Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct certain research to discover and optimize antibodies directed against the targets that we select. The Adimab Agreement will expire unless earlier terminated (a) in the event that we do not exercise any option pursuant to a research program, upon the conclusion of the last to expire Evaluation Term, or (b) if we do exercise an option, on the expiration of the last royalty term for a product in a particular country. We have the right to terminate the Adimab Agreement at any time upon advance written notice to Adimab. In addition, subject to certain conditions, either we or Adimab may terminate the Adimab Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails to cure such breach within a specified cure period after written notice is provided. Upon expiration or termination of the Adimab Agreement, all licenses granted to us on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis will continue on a non-exclusive, fully paid, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable basis.
 Manufacturing
 Our product candidates, PLN-74809 and PLN-1474, are small molecule inhibitors amenable to standard formulation technologies. We have confirmed the utility of the synthetic process and manufactured multi-kilogram quantities sufficient to provide drug product for our clinical trials. The manufacturing process of the drug substance for such product candidates is robust and accessed from readily available starting materials. The synthetic route is amenable to large-scale production and does not require unusual equipment or handling during the manufacturing process. We have obtained an adequate supply chain of the drug substance for PLN-74809 and PLN-1474 from our North American and Asian contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to satisfy both our clinical and preclinical requirements. We have engaged multiple suppliers for the manufacture of PLN-74809. We are engaging secondary raw material suppliers in addition to North American and European CMOs to mitigate global supply chain risk and ensure continuity of supply of drug substance. To maximize flexibility, we have established relationships with non-overlapping vendors for manufacturing of not only raw materials but also drug substance. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers for the GMP production of larger quantities of our drug product candidates for our clinical trials. Our internal personnel have extensive cGMP manufacturing experience in order to ensure seamless technology transfer and to manage the manufacturing and development processes conducted by third-party manufacturers. Our agreements with third-party manufacturers include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions as well as routine quality audits. In some instances, we have reserved resources from third-party manufacturers for the development and manufacture of our product candidates for near-term clinical programs.
 We do not own or operate facilities for clinical drug manufacturing, storage, distribution, or quality testing. Currently, all of our clinical manufacturing is outsourced to third-party manufacturers. As our development programs expand and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for our clinical trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale, and distribution of commercial products.
 42

Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
 U.S. government regulation of drug products
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The FDA also regulates biological products under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. If we advance clinical development of a biologic candidate in the future, these development activities will be subject to additional regulatory requirements specific to biologics. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to initiate.
 43

Clinical trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. An Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan requesting a waiver from the requirement to conduct clinical studies has been submitted to the FDA.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 44

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
 U.S. marketing exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an 
 45

NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for the original non-modified version of the drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Post-approval requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments where such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted by a manufacturer and any third parties acting on behalf of a manufacturer only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the approved label for the product. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to 
 46

significant liability. On May 10, 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a new pricing transparency rule, which was set to take effect on July 9, 2019. The rule would have required direct-to-consumer television advertisements for prescription drugs and biological products for which reimbursement is available, directly, or indirectly, through or under Medicare or Medicaid to include the list price of that product, except for a prescription drug or biological product that has a list price of less than $35 per month for a 30-day supply or typical course of treatment. The final rule was vacated by the D.C. District Court prior to taking effect. Several states have adopted price transparency requirements and those as well as any future federal price transparency requirements that may be implemented in the future could have a negative effect on our business.
 Other healthcare laws
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians, in connection with the clinical research, sales, marketing and promotion of products, once approved, and related activities, may expose a pharmaceutical manufacturer to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti- kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below: 
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward, referrals including the purchase recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA. On November 20, 2020, OIG finalized further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. These rule (with exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these rules will have on our business;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced through “qui tam” or “whistleblower” actions, and civil monetary penalty laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal health care programs that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making or causing a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing such an obligation. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, receipt, maintenance or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;

• | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and

Medicaid Services, or CMS, under the Open Payments Program, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made during the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal government price reporting laws, which requires us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities that potentially harm consumers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state and foreign anti-kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to pharmaceutical business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Efforts to ensure that business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could have a significant impact on its business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, imprisonment, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to integrity and oversight agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of operations. In addition, commercialization of any drug product outside the United States will also likely be subject to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
 In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws, and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact certain of our business activities. The CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.
 In the event we decide to conduct clinical trials or continue to enroll subjects in our ongoing or future clinical trials, we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area, or EEA, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever 
 48

is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. 
 In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the 'UK GDPR'). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The UK, however, is now regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR which means that transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognized by the EU’s GDPR, has been put in place. Although, under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement it is lawful to transfer personal data between the UK and the EEA for a 6-month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing).
 Current and future healthcare reform legislation
 In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
 There remain judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. In addition, the former Trump Administration has issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Additionally, Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. It is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended, especially given the new administration. We cannot predict what affect further changes to the ACA would have on our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Medicare sequester reductions under the Budget Control Act of 2011 will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, also amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”.
 Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. At the federal level, the form Trump administration’s budget proposal for the fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, 
 49

lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the former Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Moreover, the former Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, the Biden administration may reserve or otherwise change the measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. In addition, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Legislative and regulatory proposals, and enactment of laws, at the foreign, federal, and state levels, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, will likely continue into the future.
 Rest of World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product development, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing, distribution, marketing approval, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
 Additionally, to the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 European Union clinical trials regulation
 In the EU, a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national competent authority, or NCA, and at least one independent Ethics Committee, or EC, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. Under the current regime (the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and corresponding national laws) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or Regulation, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new Regulation, which will be directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of CTAs. It is expected that the new Regulation will come into effect following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the new Regulation, through an independent audit, which is currently expected to occur in December 2021.
 European drug review and approval
 To obtain a marketing authorization in the European Economic Area, or EEA (comprising the EU Member States, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EEA Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicines, including those produced by biotechnology, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue-engineered products) and those with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, or diabetes. The centralized procedure is optional for those medicines which contain a new active substance, or which are a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or whose authorization would be in the interest of 
 50

public health. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EEA. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 Through the decentralized procedure, a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in the EEA can be simultaneously authorized in several EEA Member States. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to other EEA Member States. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment reports, each Member State involved must decide whether to recognize the approval. If a Member State does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding. 
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required.
 European orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EEA before the application for marketing authorization is made. The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (1) is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; and (2) either the prevalence of such condition must not be more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or without the benefits derived from orphan status, it must be unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the investment needed for its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Sponsors of orphan drugs can enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including a reduction of fees or fee waivers and up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. During such period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization applications for “similar medicinal products” will not be accepted, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product, the marketing authorization holder consents to the second orphan medicinal product application, or where the marketing authorization holder cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. In the EEA, a “similar medicinal product” is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify the maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK. This transition period ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering the quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow 
 51

from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drug products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug product. Sales of drug products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drugs products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors.
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the United States.
 In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products are typically made by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each Part D prescription drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our product candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product

candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
