ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Our Business
 
We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company that discovers novel, oral, small-molecule medicines. We focus on oral treatments for rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist and an enzyme plays the key role in the biological pathway of the disease. We integrate the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug design. Structure-guided drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with particular diseases. We use X-ray crystallography, computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic activity. Molecules from our discovery efforts which are commercially available or that are in active development are summarized in the table below:

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to create stockholder value both by focusing our discovery and development efforts on oral drugs for rare diseases for which a significant unmet medical need exists and by efficiently commercializing these drugs in the United States and certain other regions upon regulatory approval. By focusing on rare disease markets, we believe that we can more effectively control the costs of, and our strategic allocation of financial resources toward, post-approval commercialization.
 
   
  

We select disease targets and product candidates in which a small molecule would offer a significant benefit over existing products or would be the first to market. We strive to advance our product candidate portfolio from discovery to commercial markets efficiently by utilizing a small group of talented and highly-skilled employees working in conjunction with strategic outsource partners. BioCryst is unique in its approach to treat orphan diseases with orally-administered, small molecules, identified by utilizing crystallography and structure-guided drug design. The principal elements of our strategy are:
 

● | Focusing on High Value-Added Structure-Guided Drug Design Technologies. We utilize structure-guided drug design in order to most efficiently develop new therapeutic candidates. Structure-guided drug design is a process by which we design a product candidate through detailed analysis of the enzyme target, which the product candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We believe that structure-guided drug design is a powerful tool for the efficient development of small-molecule product candidates that have the potential to be safe and effective. Our structure-guided drug design technologies typically allow us to design and synthesize multiple product candidates that inhibit the same enzyme target, with the goal of establishing broad intellectual property protection and formulating compounds with competitive advantages. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Selecting Inhibitors that are Promising Product Candidates. We start by selecting disease targets with well-understood biology and characteristics that fit with our ability to utilize structure-guided drug design capabilities to build potent and specific enzyme inhibitors. Next, we narrow our selection of these product candidates based on product characteristics, such as initial indications of safety and biologic activity on the target. 
● | Developing our Product Candidates Efficiently. An important element of our business strategy is to efficiently progress our product candidates through the development process. In order to accomplish this, we typically strive for disease targets with a defined clinical and regulatory pathway for approval or diseases where high unmet needs allow for frequent interactions with regulators. In addition, as we determine such relationships to be appropriate or desirable, we control certain fixed costs and overhead by outsourcing with strategic partners and contractors or entering into license agreements with third parties, including the U.S. Government. For example, our galidesivir research program is currently being developed under U.S. Government contracts. By contracting with the U.S. Government and outsourcing certain aspects of our operations, we are able to control overhead costs and focus financial resources directly where they provide the most benefit and reduce our business risk.
● | Commercializing our Product Candidates Globally. A core part of our strategy is to commercialize our rare disease products globally. We have established commercial teams in the United States and Europe for the commercialization of ORLADEYO, and we are continuing to build the structure and expertise to commercialize our products in markets where we believe we can do this efficiently and effectively. We have also established relationships with licensing and distribution partners in certain markets, including Japan, and will continue to seek such relationships where we determine this to be an effective approach. 

Products and Product Candidates
 
ORLADEYO (Berotralstat/BCX7353)
 
Hereditary Angioedema (“HAE”) is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition with a prevalence of between 1 in 33,000 to 1 in 67,000 people. HAE symptoms include recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, including the hands, feet, face, genitalia and airway. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. In addition, patients often have bouts of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, ORLADEYO, our HAE drug, suppresses bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in HAE patients. 
 
ORLADEYO is an oral, once-daily therapy discovered and developed by BioCryst for the prevention of HAE attacks.  ORLADEYO, in the 110 mg and 150 mg capsule dosage forms, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2020 for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older.  On December 16, 2020, we announced that ORLADEYO is now available for shipment to patients with a prescription in the U.S. and that our exclusive specialty pharmacy provider for ORLADEYO in the U.S. began shipping to patients.  Through EMPOWER Patient Services, administered by our specialty pharmacy provider, we aim to streamline access to therapy by providing each HAE patient and their healthcare provider with a single point of contact for access to ORLADEYO.  A dedicated care coordinator will support access for each patient with comprehensive financial support tools and reimbursement support. 
 
ORLADEYO, in the 150 mg capsule dosage form, also received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) in Japan in January 2021 for prophylactic treatment of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older.  ORLADEYO is the first and only prophylactic HAE medication approved in Japan and will be commercialized in Japan by our partner, Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Torii”).  See “Collaborations and In-License Relationships” below for a description of this relationship.  Torii will launch ORLADEYO in Japan following the successful completion of our pricing negotiations with the Japanese National Health Insurance System.  OrphanPacific, Inc. is our representative partner in Japan and holds the marketing authorization for ORLADEYO in Japan. 
 
   
  

On March 30, 2020, we announced that the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) had validated our marketing authorization application (“MAA”) submission for approval of ORLADEYO for the prevention of HAE attacks.  With this validation, the EMA began its formal review of the MAA under the centralized procedure for all member states of the European Union (the “EU”), Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.  On February 25, 2021, we announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA has adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of ORLADEYO for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of HAE in adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older.  The European Commission (“EC) will review the CHMP recommendation, and a final approval decision from the EC on the MAA for ORLADEYO is expected in the second quarter of 2021. 
 
The United Kingdom’s (“U.K.”) Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has granted a Promising Innovative Medicine designation to ORLADEYO. On October 30, 2020, we announced that the MHRA has granted ORLADEYO a positive scientific opinion through the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (“EAMS”).  Under the EAMS, HAE patients in the U.K. aged 12 years and older can gain access to ORLADEYO for the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of HAE before the drug is granted marketing authorization by the EC. We plan to file for a U.K. marketing authorization with the MHRA following our receipt of a positive opinion from the CHMP.  This is expected to result in a U.K. marketing authorization shortly after a final decision by the EC. 
 
On December 7, 2020, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust (“RPI”), pursuant to which we sold to RPI the right to receive certain royalty payments from the Company for a purchase price of $125 million in cash.  Under the Royalty Purchase Agreement, RPI is entitled to receive tiered, sales-based royalties on net product sales of ORLADEYO in the U.S., certain key European markets, and other markets where we sell ORLADEYO directly or through distributors (collectively, the “Key Territories”).  In addition, RPI is entitled to receive a tiered revenue share on amounts generally received by us on account of ORLADEYO sublicense revenue or net sales by licensees outside of the Key Territories.  No payment will be due to RPI for any achievement milestone which may be payable under the existing out-license for ORLADEYO.  See “Note 3-Royalty Monetizations-ORLADEYO Royalty Monetization” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about our obligations under the Royalty Purchase Agreement.
 
We completed the build-out of our U.S. commercial infrastructure in 2020 to support the launch of ORLADEYO in the U.S. and are currently building our commercial infrastructure to support European launches.  Based on proprietary analyses of HAE prevalence and market research studies with HAE patients, physicians, and payors in the U.S. and Europe, we anticipate the commercial market for ORLADEYO has the potential to reach a global peak of more than $500 million in annual sales.  These expectations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different.  There can be no assurance that our commercialization methods and strategies will succeed, or that the market for ORLADEYO will develop in line with our current expectations.  See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization—There can be no assurance that our commercialization efforts, methods, and strategies for our products or technologies will succeed, and our future revenue generation is uncertain” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of these risks.
 
Complement-Mediated Diseases
 
The complement system is part of the body’s natural immune system and is responsible for helping the body eliminate microbes (including viral and bacterial infections) and damaged cells. It is comprised of proteins that are primarily produced in the liver and circulate in the blood. Once activated, the complement system stimulates inflammation, phagocytosis and cell lysis. Excessive or uncontrolled activation of the complement system can cause severe, and potentially fatal, immune and inflammatory disorders. The complement system comprises biological cascades of amplifying enzyme cleavages involving more than 30 proteins and protein fragments, and may be activated through three pathways: the classical pathway (initiated by antibody-antigen complexes), the lectin pathway (initiated by lectin binding) and the alternative pathway (initiated by microbial surfaces). The alternative pathway also provides a critical amplification loop for all three pathways, regardless of the initiating mechanism. Factor D is an essential enzyme in the alternative pathway, thus making Factor D an attractive target to address complement-mediated diseases. Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by dysregulation of the complement system.
 
Discovered by BioCryst, BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent, and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D currently in early clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. Based on the safety and proof-of-concept (“PoC”) data generated to date in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) patients, we are working closely with regulators and key opinion leaders in hematology and nephrology to map the advanced development strategy across a broad set of indications. Our goal is to develop oral BCX9930 as a monotherapy for complement-mediated diseases.

On February 25, 2021, we announced that we have completed enrollment of our ongoing dose ranging trial in treatment-naïve (no prior treatment with C5 inhibitors) PNH patients and PNH patients with an inadequate response to C5 inhibitors.  The objectives of the trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability and characterize the pharmacokinetic (“PK”) and pharmacodynamic (“PD”) profiles of BCX9930 after single ascending doses (“SAD”) and multiple ascending doses (“MAD”) in healthy subjects (parts 1 and 2). In part 3 of the trial, there is an additional objective to demonstrate PoC in treatment-naïve PNH patients and PNH patients who are inadequate responders to C5 therapy (eculizumab or ravulizumab) by evaluating key biomarkers of effectiveness and assessing the dose range in PNH patients taking BCX9930. Based on the safety, tolerability, PK and PD dose-response results from parts 1 and 2 of the phase 1 trial, we completed additional MAD dosing cohorts in healthy subjects and advanced to part 3 of the trial.  We plan to present data from the 16 enrolled PNH patients (10 treatment naïve and 6 inadequate C5 responders) at our upcoming R&D day on March 22, 2021.
 
   
  

On September 30, 2020, we announced new data from treatment-naïve PNH patients receiving doses through 400 mg twice-daily of oral BCX9930 as monotherapy in the ongoing part 3 PoC dose-ranging trial. Oral BCX9930 was shown to drive rapid and dose-dependent reductions in key biomarkers, including lactate dehydrogenase (“LDH”), and increasing hemoglobin levels in all PNH patients in the trial. Increases in hemoglobin levels were maintained without transfusions. BCX9930 was safe and well tolerated at all doses in the trial. No drug-related serious adverse events had been reported. One subject was discontinued due to an unrelated serious adverse event.
 
On August 31, 2020, we announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for BCX9930 for the treatment of PNH. Orphan drug designation qualifies BCX9930 for various development incentives, including tax credits for certain clinical costs, a waiver of the new drug application fee, and a designated period of market exclusivity following approval. On August 3, 2020, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation for BCX9930 in PNH. According to the FDA, the purpose of the fast track designation is to get important new drugs to patients earlier by facilitating the development, and expediting the review, of drugs to treat serious conditions and meet an unmet medical need.
 
Under the Royalty Purchase Agreement, RPI will be entitled to receive 1.0% of global net sales, if any, of BCX9930. See “Note 3-Royalty Monetizations-ORLADEYO Royalty Monetization” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about our obligations under the Royalty Purchase Agreement.
 
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (“FOP”)
 
FOP is an ultra-rare disease that affects approximately 1 in 2 million people worldwide. It is a severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (“HO”). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. FOP patients progressively become bound by this irregular ossification, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. In patients with FOP, minor trauma can result in rapid development of painful inflammatory masses. These progress over several weeks resulting in the replacement of the affected soft tissue by permanent bone masses. There is no cure for this condition, and there are no approved treatments for FOP.
 
In 2018, we announced the advancement of a program exploring activin receptor-like kinase-2 (“ALK2”) inhibitors for treatment of FOP. ALK2 enzyme is a part of the normal signaling pathway for bone formation and responds to binding its specific ligands (bone morphogenic proteins, or BMPs), by stimulating normal bone growth and renewal in healthy children and adults. Specific activating mutations of the ALK2 gene are seen in all cases of FOP. An activating mutation in ALK2 is necessary for the disease to occur, making the ALK2 kinase an ideal drug target for treatment of FOP with an ALK2 kinase inhibitor
 
The goal of our ALK2 inhibitor program is to discover and develop orally administered kinase inhibitor drug candidates that are able to slow or prevent HO. Our lead compound, BCX9250, reduced HO in an experimental model of ALK2-driven HO in laboratory rats, with up to 89 percent reduction in volume of HO compared to controls.
 
On December 21, 2020, we announced that in a phase 1 clinical trial, BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial evaluated safety, tolerability, and PK of SAD and MAD of BCX9250 in healthy subjects. The SAD study was designed to randomize four cohorts of eight subjects each to receive oral BCX9250 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) at dose levels of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 25 mg. Subjects in the 15 mg cohort also received a second single dose to evaluate food effect on absorption of BCX9250. The MAD study was designed to randomize 4 cohorts of 12 subjects each to receive oral BCX9250 (n=10) or placebo (n=2) at dose levels of 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg once-daily for 7 days. Drug exposure increased with dose in an approximately linear and dose-proportional manner. Drug levels after a high fat meal were similar to those after dosing on an empty stomach. Drug exposure at 20 mg once-daily in the MAD was similar to that achieved with doses that suppressed HO in a nonclinical model of activity of orally dosed BCX9250. In both the SAD and the MAD studies, oral BCX9250 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, no study discontinuations due to adverse events, no grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, or safety laboratory parameters. No safety signals were seen.
 
Peramivir Injection (RAPIVAB, ALPIVAB, RAPICACTA, PERAMIFLU)
 
RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) was developed under a $234.8 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“BARDA/HHS”). In January 2010, our partner, Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (“Shionogi”), received the first approval for peramivir injection and launched it in Japan under the commercial name RAPIACTA. It is approved in Japan for the treatment of adults, children, and infants with uncomplicated seasonal influenza and those patients at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. In August 2010, our partner, Green Cross Corporation (“Green Cross”), received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food & Drug Administration under the commercial name PERAMIFLU to treat patients with influenza A & B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. See “Collaborations and In-License Relationships” below for a discussion of these licensing arrangements.

Peramivir was also approved in the United States in 2014, Taiwan in 2016, Canada in 2017, and the EU and Australia in 2018. A Supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) was approved in the United States in February 2021, extending RAPIVAB’s availability for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza to pediatric patients six months and older. Prior to this approval, peramivir had been indicated in the United States for pediatric patients two years and older.  In the United States, peramivir is indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients who have been symptomatic for no more than two days. In May 2018, peramivir, with the brand name of ALPIVAB, received approval from the EMA, although we withdrew the ALPIVAB registration in November 2020.  ALPIVAB was not commercially available in the EU at the time of the withdrawal.
 
   
  

In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) awarded us a $34.7 million contract for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period to supply the Strategic National Stockpile for use in a public health emergency. We delivered 20,000 doses of RAPIVAB under this contract in 2019 for a total price of approximately $13.9 million.  On September 3, 2020, we announced that HHS exercised its option to purchase an additional 10,000 doses of RAPIVAB under this contract for $6.9 million.  As a result, we expect to deliver at least one shipment of 10,000 doses within the contract in 2021.
 
Galidesivir (BCX4430)
 
Galidesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral (“BSAV”) that has been shown to be active against more than 20 RNA viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Marburg, Yellow Fever, Ebola, and Zika viruses and from exposures to aerosolized Marburg virus, an experimental condition designed to mimic an exposure scenario that could result during a bioterrorist attack. Our galidesivir research program is currently being developed under contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the HHS (“NIAID/HHS”) and BARDA/HHS.
 
The objective of our BSAV program is to develop galidesivir as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The primary focus of the program is treatment of hemorrhagic fever viruses. NIAID/HHS funding has supported galidesivir’s development as a treatment for Marburg virus, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus. Since September 2013, NIAID/HHS has supported the development of galidesivir as a therapeutic for Ebola and Marburg viruses. As of the date hereof, all options under our initial contract with NIAID/HHS have been awarded. The total amount under the initial contract, as amended, is $45.9 million, inclusive of the $2.9 million added to the contract in August 2020 to support the development of galidesivir. Since March 2015, BARDA/HHS has supported the development of galidesivir as a potential treatment for filoviruses. The total BARDA/HHS contract value to advance the program through toxicology studies and manufacturing work to support a new drug application is $39.1 million if all contract options are exercised. As of the date hereof, a total of $20.6 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.

In April 2020, we agreed with NIAID/HHS to add a group of COVID-19 patients to an ongoing clinical trial in Yellow Fever.  On April 9, 2020, we announced that we had opened a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Brazil to assess the safety, clinical impact, and antiviral effects of galidesivir in patients with COVID-19.  
 
On August 31, 2020, we announced that NIAID/HHS awarded us a new $43.9 million contract for the manufacture and evaluation of the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of galidesivir and that it also added $2.9 million to its existing contract with us to support the development of galidesivir.  NIAID/HHS made an initial award of $6.3 million under the new contract.

On December 22, 2020, we announced that data from part 1 of the clinical trial in Brazil showed that galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in patients infected with SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.  The trial was not designed or sized to demonstrate clinical efficacy, and no clinical efficacy benefit with galidesivir treatment compared to placebo treatment was observed in the trial.  Based on our ongoing discussions with NIAID/HHS, we expect NIAID/HHS to continue its support for the development of galidesivir with a focus on biodefense threats, such as Marburg virus disease, and to discontinue the pursuit of a COVID-19 indication for galidesivir.
 
Mundesine (forodesine)
 
Mundesine is a Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (“PNP”) inhibitor developed by Mundipharma International Corporation Limited (“Mundipharma”) as a treatment for cancer under a world-wide license agreement. PNP is a purine salvage pathway enzyme. High doses of PNP inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Mundipharma has received orphan drug status for Mundesine, and following its successful completion of a phase 2 pivotal study in recurrent/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (“PTCL”) patients in Japan, Mundesine was approved in April 2017 by the MHLW in Japan. We are currently entitled to receive royalties on Mundesine.
 
Collaborations and In-License Relationships
 
Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Torii”)
 
On November 5, 2019, we entered into a Commercialization and License Agreement with Torii (the “Torii Agreement”), granting Torii the exclusive right to commercialize ORLADEYO for the prevention of HAE attacks in Japan.
 
   
  

Under the Torii Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable payment of $22.0 million and are eligible to receive an additional milestone payment of $15.0 million upon receipt from Japan’s National Health Insurance system of a reimbursement price approval for ORLADEYO in excess of the threshold specified in the Torii Agreement.
 
In addition, under the Torii Agreement, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 20% to 40% of annual net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year. Torii’s royalty payment obligations are subject to customary reductions in certain circumstances, but may not be reduced by more than 50% of the amount that otherwise would have been payable to us in the applicable calendar quarter. Torii’s royalty payment obligations commence upon the first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan and expire upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan, (ii) the expiration of our patents covering ORLADEYO, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for ORLADEYO in Japan. We will be responsible for supplying Torii with its required amounts of ORLADEYO. The activities of the parties pursuant to the Torii Agreement will be overseen by a joint steering committee, to be composed of an equal number of representatives from each party to coordinate the development and commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan.
 
Under the Torii Agreement, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation (“ROFN”) to commercialize ORLADEYO in Japan for the acute treatment of HAE attacks if we develop ORLADEYO for such indication and to commercialize any additional kallikrein inhibitor that we may develop in the future for use in HAE in Japan. Under both ROFNs, if the parties do not agree to terms with respect to a definitive amendment to the Torii Agreement or new agreement, as applicable, the terms of the amendment or agreement would be set by a third-party arbitrator.
 
Seqirus UK Limited
 
In June 2015, we entered into a license agreement (the “SUL Agreement”) with CSL Limited (“CSL”), a company organized under the laws of Australia, granting Seqirus UK Limited (“SUL”), a limited company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom and a subsidiary of CSL, and its affiliates worldwide rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize peramivir for the treatment of influenza, except for the rights to conduct such activities in Israel, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. On March 4, 2020, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Tribunal”) delivered a Partial Arbitration Award (the “Partial Arbitration Award”) in an arbitration matter between us and SUL with respect to the SUL Agreement. In the Partial Arbitration Award, the ICC Tribunal found that, during the term, SUL materially breached and abandoned its core duties to us under the Diligent Efforts (as defined in the SUL Agreement) requirements of the SUL Agreement as applicable in the U.S. The ICC Tribunal granted a declaratory judgment in favor of us terminating the SUL Agreement and restoring all rights to peramivir to us. We agreed with SUL on a transition process for the product, with a full transition of commercialization of the product in the U.S. and Australia returned to us as of August 1, 2020 and November 1, 2020, respectively.  The ICC Tribunal also awarded us attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in securing the declaratory judgment as well as the costs incurred by us in the arbitration. Finally, the ICC Tribunal found that SUL breached the SUL Agreement by failing to pay a milestone payment due to us within 30 days of the approval of peramivir for adult use in the EU and awarded us $5.0 million (plus interest) for this claim. The ICC Tribunal retained jurisdiction for further proceedings relating to the award of attorneys’ fees and for any dispute relating to the return to us of all rights to peramivir in the Territory.
Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (“Shionogi”)
 
In February 2007, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Shionogi Agreement”), an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi to develop and commercialize peramivir in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. In October 2008, we and Shionogi amended the Shionogi Agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include Taiwan. Under the terms of the Shionogi Agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14.0 million upfront payment. The license provided for development milestone payments (up to $21.0 million), which have all been paid, and for commercial milestone payments (up to $95.0 million) in addition to double-digit (between 10% and 20%) royalty payments on product sales of peramivir.

In December 2017, we, on behalf of JPR Royalty Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioCryst (“Royalty Sub”), instituted arbitration proceedings against Shionogi in order to resolve a dispute with Shionogi under the Shionogi Agreement regarding the achievement of sales milestones and escalating royalties. The arbitration proceedings concluded with the decision that no sales milestones had been achieved and that royalties would remain the same. The costs associated with the arbitration proceedings are recoverable from the assets of Royalty Sub in accordance with the terms of the indenture and servicing agreement relating to the PhaRMA Notes (as defined below under “Shionogi Royalty Monetization and Non-Recourse Notes Payable”).
 
Generally, all payments under the Shionogi Agreement are non-refundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi is responsible for all development, regulatory, and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the Shionogi Agreement is from February 28, 2007 until terminated. Either party may terminate the Shionogi Agreement in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of termination without cause. In the event of termination, all license and rights granted to Shionogi shall terminate and shall revert back to us. We developed peramivir under a license from the University of Alabama Birmingham (“UAB”) and have paid sublicense payments to UAB on the upfront payments and will owe sublicense payments on any future event payments and/or royalties received by us from Shionogi.
 
   
  

Shionogi Royalty Monetization and Non-Recourse Notes Payable.
 
On March 9, 2011, we completed a $30.0 million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement.  Pursuant to the transaction, Royalty Sub issued $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its PhaRMA Senior Secured 14.0% Notes due 2020 (the “PhaRMA Notes”) in a private placement to institutional investors. The PhaRMA Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the “Indenture”), by and between Royalty Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee.  We received net proceeds of $22.7 million from this transaction.
 
As part of the transaction, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement, dated as of March 9, 2011, with Royalty Sub, whereby we transferred to Royalty Sub, among other things, (i) our rights to receive commercial royalty and milestone payments from Shionogi under the Shionogi Agreement and (ii) the right to receive payments under a Japanese yen/US dollar foreign currency hedge arrangement (as further described below under “Foreign Currency Hedge,” the “Currency Hedge Agreement”) put into place by us in connection with the transaction. Royalty payments are paid by Shionogi in Japanese yen, and milestone payments are paid in U.S. dollars. Our collaboration with Shionogi was not impacted by this transaction.
 
Principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are payable from, and are secured by, (i) the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, which were transferred by us to Royalty Sub, and (ii) payments, if any, made to Royalty Sub under the Currency Hedge Agreement. The PhaRMA Notes bear interest at 14.0% per annum, payable annually in arrears on September 1st of each year (the “Payment Date”). We remain entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of peramivir by Shionogi following repayment by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes.
 
Royalty Sub’s obligations to pay principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are obligations solely of Royalty Sub and are without recourse to any other person, including the Company, except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interests in Royalty Sub in support of the PhaRMA Notes. We may, but are not obligated to, make capital contributions to a capital account that may be used to redeem, or on up to one occasion pay any interest shortfall on, the PhaRMA Notes.

In September 2014, Royalty Sub was unable to pay the full amount of interest payable in September 2013 by the next succeeding payment date for the PhaRMA Notes, which was September 1, 2014. This inability constituted an event of default under the terms of the Indenture. Accordingly, we have classified the PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest as current liabilities on our balance sheet since that time. The PhaRMA Notes matured on December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes of $30.0 million, together with all accrued and unpaid interest of $20.6 million, was due in full.  As of December 31, 2020, the PhaRMA Notes remained in default, and we will continue to record the liability and accrued interest owed until it is determined that we are no longer the financial obligor.

The failure by Royalty Sub to repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, at the December 1, 2020 final maturity date, constituted an additional event of default under the PhaRMA Notes.  As a result of the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interests in Royalty Sub, and they may exercise other remedies available to them under the Indenture in respect of the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we might otherwise be adversely affected. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, in the event of any potential foreclosure, we believe the primary impact to us would be the loss of future royalty payments from Shionogi and the legal costs associated with retiring the PhaRMA Notes. As a result, we do not currently expect the continuing events of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that we will not otherwise be adversely affected as a result of the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes.
 
The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. The Indenture includes customary representations and warranties of Royalty Sub, affirmative and negative covenants of Royalty Sub, events of default and related remedies, and provisions regarding the duties of the Trustee, indemnification of the Trustee, and other matters typical for indentures used in structured financings of this type.
 
Foreign Currency Hedge 
 
In connection with the issuance by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes, we entered into the Currency Hedge Agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. Under the Currency Hedge Agreement, we had the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of 100 yen per dollar. The final tranche of the options under the Currency Hedge Agreement expired in November 2020.
 
The Currency Hedge Agreement did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, mark-to-market adjustments are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Cumulative mark-to-market adjustments resulted in losses of $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In addition, realized currency exchange gains of $0.7 million, $0.9 million, and $1.0 million were recognized in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, related to the exercise of the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen currency option under the Currency Hedge Agreement.
 
   
  

Green Cross Corporation (“Green Cross”)
 
In June 2006, we entered into an agreement with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, Green Cross is responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in Korea. Under the agreement, we received a one-time license fee of $250,000. The license provides that we will share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will pay us a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of peramivir products in Korea. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach. In the event of termination, all rights, data, materials, products, and other information would be transferred to us.
 
In August 2010, we announced that Green Cross had received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food & Drug Administration for i.v. peramivir, under the commercial name PERAMIFLU. PERAMIFLU is intended to treat patients with influenza A & B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. Green Cross received the indication of single dose administration of 300 mg i.v. peramivir.
 
Mundipharma
 
We are party to an exclusive, royalty bearing right and license agreement with Mundipharma for the development and commercialization of Mundesine for use in oncology. The agreement, as amended and restated, provides for the possibility of future event payments totaling $15.0 million for achieving specified regulatory events for certain indications and provides that we will receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-to high-single digit percentages of net product sales in each country where Mundesine is sold by Mundipharma. We licensed forodesine and other PNP inhibitors from AECOM/IRL (as defined below) and will owe sublicense payments to AECOM/IRL on all milestone payments and royalties received by us from Mundipharma.
 
Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Industrial Research, Ltd. (“AECOM” and “IRL,” respectively)
 
In June 2000, we licensed a series of potent inhibitors of PNP from AECOM and IRL (together, the “Licensors”). The lead product candidate from this collaboration is forodesine. We have obtained worldwide exclusive rights to develop and ultimately distribute it, or any other, product candidates that might arise from research on these inhibitors. We have the option to expand our license agreement with the Licensors to include other inventions in the field made by the investigators or employees of the Licensors. Under this agreement, as amended and restated, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop these drugs and to pay certain milestone payments for each licensed product (which range in the aggregate from $1.4 million to almost $4.0 million per indication) for future development, single digit royalties on net sales of any resulting product made by us, and to share a portion of future payments received from other third-party partners, if any. In addition, we have agreed to pay annual license fees, which can range from $150,000 to $500,000, that are creditable against actual royalties and other payments due to the Licensors. The Licensors have also granted us an exclusive worldwide license of galidesivir for any antiviral use.
 
The University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) 
 
We currently have agreements with UAB for influenza neuraminidase and complement inhibitors. Under the terms of these agreements, UAB performed specific research for us in return for research payments and license fees. UAB has granted us certain rights to any discoveries in these areas resulting from research developed by UAB or jointly developed with us. We have agreed to pay single digit royalties on sales of any resulting product and to share in future payments received from other third-party partners. We have completed the research under the UAB agreements. These two agreements have initial 25-year terms, are automatically renewable for five-year terms throughout the life of the last patent, and are terminable by us upon three months’ notice and by UAB under certain circumstances. Upon termination, both parties shall cease using the other parties’ proprietary and confidential information and materials, the parties shall jointly own joint inventions, and UAB shall resume full ownership of all UAB licensed products. There is currently no activity between us and UAB on these agreements, but when we license this technology, such as in the case of the Shionogi and Green Cross agreements, or commercialize products related to these programs, we will owe sublicense fees or royalties on amounts received.
 
Government Contracts
 
RAPIVAB (Peramivir Injection)
 
In September 2018, HHS awarded us a $34.7 million contract for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period, including an initial base order of 10,000 doses. In each of September 2019 and 2020, HHS exercised its options to purchase an additional 10,000 doses of RAPIVAB. We delivered a total of 20,000 doses of RAPIVAB and recorded approximately $13.9 million of product sales in 2019. We expect to deliver at least one shipment of 10,000 doses within the contract in 2021, totaling approximately $6.9 million in product sales. The RAPIVAB purchases by HHS will supply the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency.
Galidesivir
 
In March 2015, BARDA/HHS awarded us a contract for the continued development of galidesivir as a potential treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including filoviruses. This BARDA/HHS contract has a potential value of $39.1 million if all contract options are exercised. As of the date of this report, a total of $20.6 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.

In September 2013, NIAID/HHS contracted with us for the development of galidesivir as a treatment for Marburg, and subsequently, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus disease. All options under this contract have been awarded, and the total value of the contract, as amended, is $45.9 million, inclusive of the $2.9 million added to the contract in August 2020 to support the development of galidesivir. In August 2020, NIAID/HHS awarded us a new $43.9 million contract for the manufacture and evaluation of the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of galidesivir.  NIAID/HHS made an initial award of $6.3 million under this new contract.  See “Products and Product Candidates -- Galidesivir” above.  Based on our ongoing discussions with NIAID/HHS, we expect NIAID to continue its support for the development of galidesivir with a focus on biodefense threats, such as Marburg virus disease, and to discontinue the pursuit of a COVID-19 indication for galidesivir.
 
The contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS are cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. That is, we are entitled to receive reimbursement for all costs incurred in accordance with the contracts provisions that are related to the development of peramivir and galidesivir plus a fixed fee, or profit. BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS will make periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance, the timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate these contracts. These contracts are also terminable by the government at any time for breach or without cause.
 
Patents and Proprietary Information
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary technology, issued and allowed patents and patent applications which relate to compounds we are developing. We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products, proprietary technology, and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information, proprietary technology, and products and product candidates.
 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates or those developed by our partners can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we have been issued approximately 21 U.S. patents that expire between 2021 and 2039 and that relate to our kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds and PNP inhibitor compounds. We have licensed a number of compounds protected by certain composition of matter patents from AECOM and IRL, totaling three additional U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2029. Additionally, we have approximately 24 Patent Cooperation Treaty or U.S. patent applications pending related to kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds, PNP inhibitor compounds, FOP program compounds, and complement-mediated disease program compounds. Our pending applications may not result in issued patents, our patents may not cover the products of interest or may not be enforceable in all, or any jurisdictions and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially viable. After expiration of composition of matter patents for our products and product candidates, we may rely on data exclusivity, or in some cases, method of use patents. The enforceability of these patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may not be allowed or enforceable in some territories where we may seek approval. We may not have the funds to continue patent prosecution or to defend all of our existing patents in our current patent estate and may selectively abandon patents or patent families worldwide or in certain territories.
 
Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of BioCryst and, where possible, require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information.
 
   
  

Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research, development, and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive commercial and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, many have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials, and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations who conduct research in areas in which we are working. We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop. Companies that successfully complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, and commence commercial marketing and sales of their products may achieve a significant competitive advantage.
HAE
 
HAE is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by painful, unpredictable, recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the hands, feet, face, abdomen, urogenital tract, and the larynx. The inflammation can be disfiguring, debilitating, or in the case of laryngeal attacks, life-threatening. Prevalence for HAE is uncertain but is estimated to be approximately 1 case per 33,000 to 67,000 persons without known differences among ethnic groups and is caused by deficient (Type I) or dysfunctional (Type II) levels of C1-Inhibitor (“C1-INH”), a naturally occurring molecule that is known to inhibit kallikrein, bradykinin, and other serine proteases in the blood. If left untreated, HAE can result in a mortality rate as high as 40% primarily due to upper airway obstruction. There are several licensed therapies for HAE, including the following:

● | C1-INH replacement therapy is available as an acute therapy (Berinert®) and as a prophylactic therapy (Haegarda® and Cinryze®). These therapies are dosed subcutaneously and intravenously. Recombinant C1-INH (Ruconest®) is also available as an acute therapy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Kallikrein Inhibitors - Kalbitor® (ecallantide) is a specific recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor that is dosed subcutaneously by healthcare providers to treat acute HAE attacks. Takhzyro™ (lanadelumab-flyo) is a monoclonal antibody approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks and can be self-administered as a subcutaneous injection. 
● | Bradykinin receptor antagonist - Firazyr® (icatibant) is the treatment of acute attacks and is administered by subcutaneous administration. To date, there have been seven generic forms of icatibant approved by the FDA. 
● | Other medications - Prophylactic administration of synthetic attenuated androgens (generically available as danazol or stanozolol) has been utilized to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. However, long-term use of danazol or stanozolol may result in liver damage, virilization and arterial hypertension. Six-month liver function tests, annual lipid profiles, and biennial hepatic ultrasound are recommended for patients on chronic androgen therapy.

 
We are aware of a number of HAE therapies in clinical development that, if approved, may compete with ORLADEYO. These include:
 

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase | Role in Therapy 
----------+--------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------------+----------------------
KalVista | KVD-900 | Kallikrein inhibitor | Oral | II | Acute treatment 
 | KVD-824 | Kallikrein inhibitor | Oral | I | Prophylaxis 
Pharvaris | PHA121 (PHVS416/PHVS719) | B2 bradykinin antagonist | Oral | II | Acute and Prophylaxis
Attune | ATN-249 | Kallikrein inhibitor | Oral | I | Prophylaxis 
CSL | CSL312 | Anti-factor XII mAb | IV/Subcutaneous | III | Prophylaxis 
Ionis | IONIS-PKK-LRx | Antisense inhibitor of prekallikrein | Subcutaneous | II | Prophylaxis 

 
Complement-Mediated Diseases
 
Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by defects of the complement system, including PNH, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (“aHUS”), complement 3 glomerulopathy (“C3G”), and myasthenia gravis. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Soliris® (eculizumab) is a C5 inhibitor approved for PNH, aHUS, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Soliris had global sales of over $3.9 billion in 2019. Alexion also recently received FDA approval for Ultomiris™ (ravulizumab), a longer-acting C5 inhibitor, as a treatment for PNH in late 2018 and aHUS in late 2019. Global sales for Ultomiris were $339 million in 2019. In addition, Alexion acquired Achillion, a developer of oral Factor D inhibitors, in early 2020. In December 2020, Alexion agreed to be acquired by AstraZeneca, with the deal expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.
 
   
  

In addition to BCX9930, we are aware of a number of complement pathway-based products in development, which include:
 

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase
-------------+-----------------------+---------------------+-------------------------+------------
Apellis | Pegcetacoplan (APL-2) | C3 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | NDA 
Akari | Nomacopan | C5 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | III 
Roche | Crovalimab (RG6107) | C5 Inhibitor | IV / Subcutaneous | III 
Regeneron | Pozelimab | C5 Inhibitor | IV / Subcutaneous | III 
Omeros | Narsoplimab | MASP-2 | IV / Subcutaneous | BLA 
 | OMS906 | MASP-3 | Subcutaneous | I 
Alexion | Danicopan (ALXN2040) | Factor D Inhibitor | Oral | III 
 | Vermicopan (ALXN2050) | Factor D Inhibitor | Oral | II 
Novartis | Iptacopan (LNP023) | Factor B Inhibitor | Oral | III 
 | Tesidolumab | C5 Inhibitor | IV | II 
ChemoCentryx | Avacopan | C5aR Inhibitor | Oral | NDA 
Ra / UCB | Zilucoplan | C5 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | II 
Alnylam | Cemdisiran | C5 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | II 

 
Amgen (Phase 3), Samsung, and Isu Abxis are also in clinical trials developing biosimilars of eculizumab.
 
FOP
 
FOP is a rare, severely disabling condition characterized by HO. HO can occur in muscles, tendons, and soft tissue. FOP patients progressively become bound by this irregular ossification, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.
 
In addition to BCX9250, we are aware of a number of FOP therapies in clinical development, which include:
 

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase
----------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------------
Ipsen | Palovarotene | Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Gamma Agonist | Oral | III 
 | BLU-782 | ALK-2 Inhibitor | Oral | I 
Regeneron | Garetosmab | Anti-activin A | IV | II 
Incyte | INCB00928 | ALK-2 Inhibitor | Oral | I 
Keros | KER-047 | ALK-2 Inhibitor | Oral | I 

Antivirals
 
The pharmaceutical market for products that prevent or treat influenza is very competitive. Key competitive factors for RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) include, among others, efficacy, ease of use, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, storage and handling requirements, and reimbursement. A number of products are currently available in the U.S. and/or other counties, including Japan, for the prevention or treatment of influenza, including seasonal flu vaccines, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.’s (“Roche”) TAMIFLU® (oseltamivir), generic oseltamivir, GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (“GSK”) RELENZA®, Genentech and Shiongi’s XOFLUZA™ and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.’s INAVIR®. In addition, FUJIFILM Corporation’s favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, is approved in Japan.
 
Various government entities throughout the world are offering incentives, grants, and contracts to encourage additional investment into preventative and therapeutic agents against influenza, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors.
 
Galidesivir is a product candidate in our BSAV research program and is currently being developed under contracts with NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS. The objective of our BSAV program is to develop galidesivir as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The U.S. Government is investing in a number of programs intended to address gaps in its medical countermeasure plan. Currently, there are five investigational therapeutics under a compassionate use/expanded access framework that can be available in an outbreak setting to treat Ebola virus disease.
 
In order to compete successfully in these and other therapeutic areas, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.
 
Research and Development
 
We initiated our research and development activities in 1986. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced research technologies, including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry, and pharmacology. Our research facilities, located in Birmingham, Alabama, include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and facilities to make product candidates on a small scale for early-stage clinical trials.
Compliance
 
We conduct our business in an ethical, fair, honest, and lawful manner. We act responsibly, respectfully, and with integrity in our relationships with patients, health care professionals, collaborators, governments, regulatory entities, stockholders, suppliers, and vendors. 
 
In order to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, and Senior Vice President of Human Resources oversee compliance training, education, auditing, and monitoring; enforce disciplinary guidelines for any infractions of our corporate polices; implement new policies and procedures; respond to any detected issues; and undertake corrective action procedures. Our controls address compliance with laws and regulations that govern public pharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, the following: federal and state law, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; Nasdaq listing requirements; the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the SEC, the FDA, and HHS; and applicable laws and regulations administered by foreign regulatory authorities, including those of the EU, the U.K., and Japan. Our standard operating procedures are designed to provide a framework for corporate governance in accordance with ethical standards and best legal practices.
 
Government Regulation
 
The FDA regulates the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the U.S., and our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulations prior to commercialization. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In foreign countries, our products are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments. These government regulations are a significant factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process may subject us to sanctions, including:

● | delays; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | warning letters; 
● | fines; 
● | product recalls or seizures; 
● | injunctions; 
● | penalties; 
● | refusal of the FDA to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications;
● | total or partial suspension of production; 
● | civil penalties; 
● | withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and 
● | criminal prosecutions. 

 
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred, and significant time may be devoted to clinical development.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or approval of new indications for our existing products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 
FDA Regulation
 
Before testing potential product candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an investigation new drug application (“IND”), including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. Thirty days after filing an IND, a phase 1 human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the trial.
 
Clinical trials to support a new drug application (“NDA”) are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.
 
Phase 1 — During phase 1, which involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy volunteers, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, PK, and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses.
 
   
  

Phase 2 — Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: (1) assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; (2) assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 
Phase 3 (pivotal) — If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal studies, major studies, or advanced clinical trials, are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. In general, the FDA requires that at least two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials be conducted.
 
Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent on several factors, including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take several weeks to several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at which patients enroll in the study depends on:
 

● | willingness of investigators to participate in a study; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ability of clinical sites to obtain approval from their IRB; 
● | the availability of the required number of eligible subjects to be enrolled in a given trial;
● | the availability of existing or other experimental drugs for the disease we intend to treat; 
● | the willingness of patients to participate; and 
● | the patients meeting the eligibility criteria. 

 
Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased expense and longer development timelines.
 
After successful completion of the required clinical testing, generally an NDA is submitted. Upon receipt of the NDA, the FDA will review the application for completeness. Within 60 days, the FDA will determine if the application is sufficiently complete to warrant full review and will consider the application “filed” at that time. Also upon receipt of the application, the FDA will assign a review priority to the application. Priority review applications are usually reviewed within 6 months; standard review applications are usually reviewed within 10 months. The FDA may refer NDAs for new molecular entities to an appropriate advisory committee for review and evaluation in regard to providing a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation of an advisory committee.
 
Following the review of the application, which may include requests for additional information from the sponsor and results from inspections of manufacturing and clinical sites, the FDA will issue an “action letter” on the application. The action letter will either be an “approval letter,” in which case the product may be lawfully marketed in the United States, or a “complete response letter.” A complete response letter will state that the FDA cannot approve the NDA in its present form and, usually, will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the application. The complete response letter, when possible, will include the FDA’s recommended actions to place the application in a condition for approval. Deficiencies can be minor (e.g., labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). A complete response letter may also be issued before the FDA conducts the required facility inspection and/or reviews labeling, leaving the possibility that additional deficiencies in the original NDA could be subsequently cited. An applicant receiving a complete response letter is permitted to resubmit the NDA addressing the identified deficiencies (in which case a new two- or six-month review cycle will begin), or withdraw the NDA. The FDA may consider a failure to take action within one year of a complete response letter to be a request to withdraw, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit the NDA. If the FDA approves an NDA, the marketing of the product will be limited to the particular disease states and conditions of use that are described in the product label.
 
We and all of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with the applicable FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations during clinical development and to ensure that the product can be consistently manufactured to meet the specifications submitted in an NDA. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to product quality, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities must be approved by the FDA before they can be used to manufacture our products. Based on an inspection, the FDA determines whether manufacturing facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities in non-United States countries that are utilized to manufacture drugs for distribution into the United States are also subject to inspection by the FDA. Additionally, failure to comply with local regulatory requirements could affect production and availability of product in relevant markets.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above, as well as additional country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
   
  

For example, under EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions, and the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. The U.K.’s exit from the EU, or Brexit, has caused political and economic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and product candidates, and this uncertainty may persist for years.

Under the Japanese regulatory system administered by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), pre-marketing approval and clinical studies are required for all pharmaceutical products. To obtain manufacturing/marketing approval, we must submit an application for approval to the MHLW with results of nonclinical and clinical studies to show the quality, efficacy, and safety of a new drug. A data compliance review, good Clinical Practices, or GCP, on-site inspection, cGMP audit, and detailed data review are undertaken by the PMDA. The application is then discussed by the committees of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council (“PAFSC”). Based on the results of these reviews, the final decision on approval is made by MHLW. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the MHLW sets the prices of the products on this list. Following the January 2021 approval of ORLADEYO in Japan, negotiations regarding the reimbursement price with MHLW have begun. The price will be determined within 60 to 90 days following approval unless the applicant disagrees, which may result in extended pricing negotiations. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The Japanese government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.
