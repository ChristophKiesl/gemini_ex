Item 1. Business
Overview
Emergent Capital, Inc. was founded in December 2006 as a Florida limited liability company, Imperial Holdings, LLC, and converted into Imperial Holdings, Inc. on February 3, 2011, in connection with the Company’s initial public offering. Effective September 1, 2015, the name was changed to Emergent Capital, Inc. (with its subsidiary companies, the "Company" or "Emergent Capital").
Emergent Capital, through its subsidiaries owns two life insurance policies, also referred to as life settlements, with a fair value of $1.3 million and an aggregate death benefit of approximately $12.0 million at November 30, 2019. Additionally, through a subsidiary, the Company owns a 27.5% equity investment, having an estimated fair value of approximately $137.8 million at November 30, 2019, in White Eagle Asset Portfolio, LP ("White Eagle"), which was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that holds a portfolio of life settlements. The Company primarily earns income through change in fair value and death benefits from these two polices and change in fair value and distributions from its equity investment in White Eagle.
Change in Financial Year End
On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors adopted resolutions to change the Company’s fiscal year end, and have the Company cause its direct and indirect subsidiaries change their fiscal year ends, from December 31 to November 30, effective immediately. Our financial results for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2019 will cover the twelve months of transactions from December 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019, and are compared to the results of our previous fiscal year ended November 30, 2018 which covers the eleven months transition period from January 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018 and our previous twelve month year-end as of December 31, 2017.
Voluntary Petitions for Relief Under Chapter 11 and De-consolidation of Subsidiaries
On November 14, 2018 (the "Petition Date"), Lamington Road Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Lamington Road Limited), the Company’s wholly-owned indirect Irish subsidiary ("Lamington" or "Lamington Road DAC"), and White Eagle General Partner, LLC, the Company’s wholly-owned indirect Delaware subsidiary ("WEGP"), filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Lamington is the limited partner and owns 99.99%, and WEGP is the general partner and owns 0.01%, of White Eagle. In its capacity as general partner, WEGP manages the affairs of White Eagle. The Lamington and WEGP filings are referred to as the "November Chapter 11 Cases."
The commencement of the November Chapter 11 Cases would constitute defaults and events of default under the terms of the Company’s Amended and Restated Senior Secured Indenture and the New Convertible Note Indenture (each as defined below). However, such defaults and events of default and their consequences were waived in advance of the November Chapter 11 Cases by holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amounts of each of the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes and the New Convertible Notes, and consequently, the Company believes that no defaults, events of default or acceleration of the payment obligations thereunder, including principal or accrued interest, occurred under either the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Indenture or the New Convertible Note Indenture. The commencement of the November Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default under the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of January 31, 2017, by and among White Eagle, as borrower, Imperial Finance and Trading, LLC, Lamington Road Bermuda, LTD, as Portfolio Manager ("Lamington Bermuda"), CLMG Corp., as Administrative Agent ("CLMG"), and LNV Corporation, as Lender ("LNV"), as amended (the "White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility"), resulting in the principal and accrued interest due from White Eagle thereunder becoming immediately due and payable. Lamington and WEGP have pledged their respective interests in White Eagle to secure its obligations under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility. Any efforts by LNV, or CLMG to enforce such pledges by Lamington and WEGP of their respective interests in White Eagle in connection with the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility are automatically stayed as a result of the commencement of the November Chapter 11 Cases and LNV’s and CLMG’s rights of enforcement in respect of the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, on November 15, 2018, White Eagle, LNV and CLMG entered into an Agreement Regarding Rights and Remedies (the "Standstill Agreement"), pursuant to which LNV and CLMG agreed to refrain from exercising their rights and remedies in connection with the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the terms and provisions of the Standstill Agreement, until 12:00 p.m. noon Pacific time on November 26, 2018, to facilitate negotiations. 
1

The effective period under the Standstill Agreement was extended several times, finally to December 13, 2018. On November 25, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order and final decree closing both of the Lamington and WEGP chapter 11 cases.
On December 13, 2018, White Eagle filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "White Eagle Chapter 11 Case" and, together with the November Chapter 11 Cases, the "Chapter 11 Cases"). The Company obtained waivers from the requisite holders of each of the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes and the New Convertible Notes with respect to the White Eagle Chapter 11 Case, similar to the waivers for the November Chapter 11 Cases, and believes that no defaults, events of default or acceleration of the payment obligations thereunder, including principal or accrued interest, occurred with respect to both the 8.5% Senior Secured Notes and the New Convertible Notes. On September 16, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order and final decree closing the White Eagle Chapter 11 Case.
Beal Litigation
On January 25, 2019, the Company, White Eagle, Lamington, and WEGP, collectively the "Plaintiffs", filed suit (the "Suit") against LNV , Silver Point Capital L.P. ("Silver Point") and GWG Holdings, Inc. ("GWG" and, with LNV and Silver Point, the "Defendants") in the Bankruptcy Court, where the Suit will be administered together with the Chapter 11 Cases. LNV, a subsidiary of Beal Bank ("Beal"), is the lender under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility.
In the Suit, the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants engaged in a scheme to coerce the Plaintiffs into selling their valuable portfolio of life insurance policies to defendants for well below its true value. Pursuant to the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, LNV agreed to lend $370 million to White Eagle, and in connection therewith received a 45% equity stake in White Eagle. That equity stake, and LNV’s significant control over White Eagle under the Credit Facility, creates a joint venture, and gives rise to fiduciary duties to White Eagle and Emergent, on the part of LNV. The Plaintiffs further allege that LNV has been engaged in a concerted campaign to "squeeze" White Eagle and Emergent by improperly restricting their cash flow, in the hopes that White Eagle and Emergent will have no choice but to sell the valuable policy portfolio to LNV or one of its proxies, including Silver Point and/or GWG, at below its true value.
In connection with the White Eagle Chapter 11 Case, on January 15, 2019, the Court authorized the Debtors to use the proceeds of pre-petition cash collateral for a period of twenty (20) weeks (the "Cash Collateral"), which allowance was extended in May 2019 for another nine (9) weeks. The Cash Collateral may be used solely for the purposes permitted under the budget approved by the Court, including (i) to provide working capital needs of the Debtors and general corporate purposes of the Debtors, (ii) to make the payments or fund amounts otherwise permitted in the final order that authorized such uses and such budget, (iii) to fund amounts necessary to pay certain fees; and (iv) to fund amounts necessary to pay certain professional fees in accordance with such Budget.
Global Settlement Agreement in Principle in Bankruptcies
On May 7, 2019, a global settlement in principle of the Chapter 11 Cases and the Suit was announced on the record to, and filed with, the Bankruptcy Court jointly by the Debtors and Defendants (the "Proposed Settlement"). The Proposed Settlement would be effected together with the plan of reorganization, in accordance with the following schedule: (x) the Proposed Settlement and plan of reorganization, and other relevant documents, would be filed with the Bankruptcy Court by May 24, 2019, (y) the parties would use their best efforts to have the Proposed Settlement approved by the Bankruptcy Court by June 7, 2019, and (z) the parties would use their best efforts to have a confirmation hearing for approval of the plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court held on or before June 21, 2019.
Pursuant to the Proposed Settlement, among other things:

• | White Eagle shall have up to and including September 17, 2019 to satisfy any and all obligations to LNV under the Credit Facility by paying LNV 102% of its outstanding principal plus accrued interest at the relevant default rate, accrued fees and costs, which aggregate amount would include the resolution of the 45% participation interest element of the Credit Facility which was part of the subject matter of the Suit;


• | If White Eagle satisfies such obligations after September 17, 2019 and by December 30, 2019, the amount due on the outstanding principal would increase to 104%;


• | In the event LNV has not received the payoff described above by September 17, 2019, the court-appointed liquidation trustee, together with investment banking assistance from Maple Life Financial, LLC, shall have full authority to sell

2

White Eagle’s life insurance policy portfolio (which constitutes collateral under the Credit Facility) for the maximum amount achievable through an orderly sale process, taking into account that the transaction must be closed no later than December 30, 2019; in connection with this authority, the liquidation trustee and the investment banker may work prior to September 17, 2019 to prepare the portfolio for sale, but may not take actions to actually commence a sale including, but not limited to, marketing the portfolio or contacting potential buyers about the portfolio, prior to such date.

• | If the portfolio is sold in whole or in part, LNV shall only have the right to step in to bid for such sale if, and to the extent, the total amounts generated through the sale thereof do not fully satisfy the payoff amount.


• | If the sale of any portion of the policies that serve as collateral under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility (the "Collateral") has not closed or the proceeds of such sale(s) have not been received by CLMG by December 30, 2019, and if the obligations due to LNV (the "Payoff Amount") has not then been paid in cash in full, such Collateral shall be transferred on or before Noon Eastern on December 31, 2019 to CLMG (or its designee) in full satisfaction of the remaining unpaid portion of the amounts due to LNV.

In addition, in order to provide sufficient cash flow to the Company during this period, and subject to negotiation of mutually-agreed upon terms and conditions, the Debtors shall have the right to use proceeds from the maturity of any portfolio policy and resolution of certain claims, and LNV will provide the Debtors a revolving $15.0 million of debtor-in-possession financing (which amount may be increased if found to be insufficient) through December 30, 2019 (the "DIP Financing").
On June 5, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement memorializing the Proposed Settlement (the "Settlement Agreement") and the DIP Financing. The plan of reorganization for the Chapter 11 Cases, which implements the Settlement Agreement and the DIP Financing (the "Plan of Reorganization") was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on June 19, 2019.
On July 18, 2019, the Company entered into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") with Lamington, White Eagle and Jade Mountain Partners, LLC ("Jade Mountain") in connection with the Plan of Reorganization. The Commitment Letter provided for a transaction in which Jade Mountain and/or certain of its affiliates and/or certain investors would acquire 72.5% of the equity interests of White Eagle in exchange for $384.3 million as may be adjusted in accordance with the final documentation. The Commitment Letter and its terms and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the Bankruptcy Court on July 22, 2019.
Repayment and Termination of the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility
On August 16, 2019, the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the "Subscription Agreement") with Lamington Road ("Class B Limited Partner"), White Eagle, WEGP ("Withdrawing General Partner"), and Palomino JV, L.P. ("Palomino" or "Class A Limited Partner"), in connection with the commitment letter signed on June 22, 2019 with Jade Mountain pursuant to which White Eagle sold to Palomino 72.5% of its limited partnership interests, consisting of all of the newly issued and outstanding Class A and Class D interests, and WEGP sold to an affiliate of Jade Mountain (the "Manager") all of its general partnership interests (collectively, the "WE Investment") for a purchase price of approximately $366.2 million and $8.0 million for the Class A and Class D interests, respectively. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, Lamington received 27.5% of the limited partnership interests of White Eagle, consisting of all of the newly issued and outstanding Class B interests in exchange for all of its previously owned White Eagle limited partnership interests with a value of approximately $138.9 million on the closing date.
The proceeds of the WE Investment were used to satisfy in full (i) the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, and (ii) DIP Financing extended by CLMG, as Administrative Agent ("CLMG"), as agent, and LNV, as Lender, to White Eagle, each in connection with the termination of the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility and the release of the related liens on the collateral thereunder pursuant to a Master Termination Agreement dated as of August 16, 2019 among WEGP, Lamington, White Eagle, Markley Asset Portfolio, LLC, CLMG, as administrative agent, LNV, as initial lender, Wilmington Trust, National Association, in its capacities as securities intermediary, custodian and agent, and Palomino (the "Master Termination Agreement"). The repayment and termination of the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility and the termination of the DIP Financing, which had not been drawn against, were in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization for Lamington, WEGP and White Eagle approved by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Chapter 11 Cases.
The WE Investment was consummated, and the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility was paid off in full and terminated, on August 16, 2019. The payoff totaled $402.5 million, which included payment directly to CLMG by Palomino of $374.2 million and payment to CLMG by White Eagle of $28.3 million, collectively sufficient to repay, under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, the outstanding principal of $368.0 million, accrued and unpaid interest of $21.3 million plus, under 
3

the Plan of Reorganization, an early payment amount due to LNV of $7.4 million and lender-allowed claims of $5.8 million. Of the $374.2 million purchase price of the limited partnership, $8.0 million was allocated to the Class D interests which amount is to be repaid in accordance with the distribution terms of the amended and restated Limited Partnership Agreement of White Eagle.
In connection with the WE Investment, the Limited Partnership Agreement of White Eagle was amended and restated (the "A&R LPA") to provide for the issuance of the Class A, B and D limited partnership interests, and for funding of an "Advance Facility" to maintain reserves sufficient to fund premiums, certain operating expenses of White Eagle and certain minimum payments to Lamington as the holder of the Class B interests. Pursuant to the A&R LPA, holders of Class A interests are entitled to receive distributions on the amounts paid or contributed by them in relation to the WE Investment and funding of the Advance Facility after payment of premiums on the portfolio policies and other fees and expenses. The A&R LPA provides generally that holders of the Class A and Class B Interests receive distributions of proceeds of the assets of White Eagle based on their 72.5% and 27.5% ownership, respectively, after certain expenses and reserves are funded (including such minimum payments to Lamington totaling approximately $8.0 million per year for the first three (3) years and $4.0 million for the subsequent seven (7) years), provided that commencing after year three (3), such minimum payments will be utilized to repay the Class D Return of $8.0 million, which was advanced at closing, plus the greater of $2.0 million or 11% per annum on such $8.0 million to the extent necessary to fully repay such Class D Return. The minimum payments to the Company will occur regardless of maturities with payments through the premium/expense reserve account when there are no maturity proceeds available for distributions as described below). However, the A&R LPA also provides that all payments to holders of the Class B interests (other than such minimum payments to Lamington during the first eight (8) years following the Closing Date) are fully subordinated to payments in respect of the minimum returns to holders of the Class A and Class D interests (including repayment of all amounts advanced in respect of the Advance Facility) and to any indemnification payments, if any, due to such holders and related indemnified persons pursuant to the indemnities afforded them in and in relation to the A&R LPA, Subscription Agreement, Master Termination Agreement and related documents. As of the closing of the Investment, Lamington Bermuda resigned as manager of the portfolio and was replaced by Jade Mountain or an affiliate thereof.
On August 16, 2019, Lamington also entered into (i) a pledge agreement (the "Pledge Agreement") pursuant to which it pledged the 27.5% limited partnership interests of White Eagle owned by it to Palomino and certain other secured parties in support of the payment and indemnification obligations described above, and (ii) an assumption agreement among White Eagle, Lamington, the Company and WEGP (the "Assumption Agreement") pursuant to which Lamington assumed all liabilities and obligations of White Eagle and WEGP as of the closing date of the Transactions, and Lamington, the Company and WEGP agreed to terminate, waive and release any intercompany debt, obligations and liabilities of White Eagle to Lamington, the Company and WEGP. On August 16, 2019, Emergent entered into an indemnification agreement (the "Indemnification Agreement") pursuant to which it indemnified Wilmington Trust, National Association against claims and liabilities that may arise in relation to policies that have matured prior to the Closing Date but as to which Wilmington Trust, National Association has historically held title as securities intermediary.
See Note 10, "Investment in Limited Partnership", to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Deconsolidation and Subsequent Measurement of the Deconsolidated Entities
Lamington and its subsidiaries' (White Eagle, WEGP and Lamington Bermuda), financial results were excluded from the Company’s consolidated results for the period from November 14, 2018, the Petition Date to August 16, 2019 the date the White Eagle Revolving Facility was terminated. ASC 810, Consolidation require that an entity whose financial statements were previously consolidated with those of its parent that files for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, whether solvent or insolvent, generally must be prospectively deconsolidated from the parent and presented as an equity investment (deconsolidation applies to Lamington and all subsidiaries owned, directly or indirectly, by Lamington, including WEGP, White Eagle and Lamington Bermuda which collectively are referred to herein as the ("Deconsolidated Entities" or the "Debtors"). Therefore, our 2019 results are not comparable with our 2018 results. Under ASC 810, this loss of control would likely trigger a gain or loss for the parent as the parent would remeasure its retained noncontrolling investment at fair value each reporting period. We assessed the inherent uncertainties associated with the outcome of the Chapter 11 reorganization process and the anticipated duration thereof, and concluded that it was appropriate to deconsolidate Lamington and its subsidiaries effective on the Petition Date.
Lamington and WEGP had pledged their respective interests in White Eagle to secure its obligations under the White Eagle Revolving Credit Facility, with the termination of the facility, this pledge was also terminated. There was no outstanding third party liabilities for either Lamington or WEGP at August 16, 2019 besides intercompany obligations to Emergent.

On September 16, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order and final decree closing the White Eagle Chapter 11 Case, and on November 25, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order and final decree closing both of the Lamington and WEGP chapter 11 cases. However pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation, management took the position that given that all third party claims had been satisfied in the case, consolidation of Lamington and WEGP as of August 17, 2019 was appropriate.
As part of the WE Investment, the Company sold 72.5% of its ownership in White Eagle, which is the most substantial asset of the Company, resulting in a reduction in its ownership from 100% to 27.5%. Given the new percentage ownership, this is considered an equity investment. Based on the A&R LPA, the Company will receive funds from White Eagle through a monthly distribution which is highly driven by maturities of the portfolio. Although the Company is guaranteed certain monthly payments, the Class A Partner must be made whole based on their established internal rate of return ("IRR") of 11% which exposes the Company as to the amount and timing of funds that will be received. Although White Eagle continues to be a variable interest entity ("VIE") under ASC 810, Consolidation, the Company has not met the criteria for consolidation as they do not have a controlling interest in While Eagle, financially or otherwise. Based on the A&R LPA, the Company's management responsibilities are very limited. The Company's remaining ownership of White Eagle does not give the Company any control over decisions of White Eagle and the Company is the minority owner. As a result, the Company is precluded from consolidating White Eagle at November 30, 2019.
White Eagle previously valued its life settlement policies at fair value whose valuation were based on inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. The Company now holds an equity investment of 27.5% in White Eagle whose only assets are these life settlements. Additionally, the investment includes a mezzanine financing which the Company assumed at closing which repayment by, and ultimate distributions to, the Company are based on a prescribed waterfall with a guaranteed 11% return to the majority owner partner. The Company will utilize a fair value approach to account for its 27.5% investment in White Eagle, and the calculation will be performed consistent with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings.
Life Settlements Portfolio & Portfolio Management
The life insurance policies previously included in the Company and its subsidiaries portfolio were acquired through a combination of direct policy purchases from the original policy owners (the secondary market), purchases of policies owned by other institutional investors (the tertiary market) and from policy surrenders or foreclosures in satisfaction of loans issued under the Company’s legacy premium finance business. Emergent Capital previously used a probabilistic method of valuing life insurance policies, meaning the insured individual's probability of survival and probability of death are applied to the required premiums and net death benefit of the policy to extrapolate the likely cash flows over the life expectancy of the insured. These likely cash flows are then discounted using a net present value formula. Management believes this to be the preferred valuation method in the industry at the present time.
Until a policy matures, the Company must pay ongoing premiums to keep that policy in force and to prevent it from lapsing. Upon a policy lapse, the Company would suffer a complete loss on its investment in that policy. 
Regulation
The sale and solicitation of life insurance policies in the secondary market is highly regulated by the laws and regulations of individual states and other applicable jurisdictions. The purchase of a policy directly from a policy owner is referred to as a life settlement and is regulated on a state-by-state basis.
At November 30, 2019, the Company, through its subsidiary Imperial Life Settlements, LLC, maintained licenses to transact life settlements as a provider in 28 of the states that currently require a license and could conduct business in 36 states, and the District of Columbia.
The primary regulator for Imperial Life Settlements, LLC when purchasing life settlements in the secondary market is the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation. A majority of the state laws and regulations concerning life settlements relate to: (i) provider and broker licensing requirements; (ii) reporting requirements; (iii) required contract provisions and disclosures; (iv) privacy requirements; (v) fraud prevention measures; (vi) criminal and civil remedies; (vii) marketing requirements; (viii) the time period in which policies cannot be sold in life settlement transactions; and (ix) other rules governing the relationship between policy owners, insured persons, insurers, and others.

Competition
Competition is primarily through two channels: life settlement providers and institutional investors. In order to be a life settlement provider and transact with the original holder of a life insurance policy, in most instances, a license on a state-by-state basis is required. The life settlement business is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition is diverse. Often, life settlement providers are originating life settlements on behalf of institutional investors who do not maintain the necessary licenses to transact in the secondary market for life insurance. These investors may have significantly more resources than the Company and can generally also transact directly in the tertiary market.
Employees
At November 30, 2019, we employed 9 full-time employees and no part-time employees. None of our employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good.
