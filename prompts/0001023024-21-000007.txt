Item 1. Business
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, ANIP Acquisition Company and ANI Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (together, “ANI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering value to our customers by developing, manufacturing, and marketing high quality branded and generic prescription pharmaceuticals. We focus on niche and high barrier to entry opportunities including controlled substances, oncology products (anti-cancer), hormones and steroids, and complex formulations. Our three pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, of which two are located in Baudette, Minnesota and one is located in Oakville, Ontario, are together capable of producing oral solid dose products, as well as semi-solids, liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment. 
Through product launches, acquisitions of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”), New Drug Applications (“NDAs”), product rights, and entry into agreements to obtain the distribution rights for various products, we have a commercial portfolio of 65 products as of December 31, 2020. In addition, in January 2016, we acquired the Cortrophin gel and Cortrophin-Zinc NDAs. We continue to focus on the re-commercialization of these products while increasing our portfolio of generic and mature brand products.
On August 6, 2018, our subsidiary, ANI Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (“ANI Canada”), acquired all the issued and outstanding equity interests of WellSpring Pharma Services Inc. (“WellSpring”), a Canadian company that performs contract development and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. In conjunction with the transaction, we acquired WellSpring’s pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, laboratory, and offices, its current book of commercial business, as well as an organized workforce. 
Unless otherwise required by the context, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "we," us," and "our" refer to ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in April 2001. Our principal executive offices are located at 210 Main Street West, Baudette, Minnesota, 56623, our telephone number is (218) 634-3500, and our website address is www.anipharmaceuticals.com.
Strategy
Our objective is to build a sustainable and growing biopharmaceutical company serving patients in need and creating long-term value for our investors. Our growth strategy is driven by the following key pillars:
Building a successful Cortrophin Gel franchise.
We acquired the NDAs for Cortrophin gel and Cortrophin-Zinc in January 2016; executed long-term supply agreements with a supplier of our primary raw material for corticotrophin active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), a supplier of corticotrophin API with whom we have advanced the manufacture of commercial scale batches of API, and a Cortrophin gel fill/finish contract manufacturer. In April 2020, the FDA issued a Refusal to File (“RTF”) letter for our Supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for Cortrophin Gel. Currently, our efforts are focused on the preparation of a complete resubmission of sNDA. We have retained a prominent regulatory consulting firm to support our efforts and augment the capabilities of our restructured internal Cortrophin development team. Together, we have performed a comprehensive review of the original sNDA filing and prepared an internal gap assessment and execution plan to address these gaps. Throughout, we have remained engaged with the FDA and plan to re-submit our supplemental NDA in the second quarter of 2021.
We have invested in leadership and expertise in the areas of commercialization of rare disease therapies to develop a launch strategy and commercial plan for this product.

Strengthening our generics business with enhanced research and development capability and increased focus on niche opportunities
​
We have grown our generics business through a combination of market share gains on existing products and new product launches. We have also successfully acquired numerous ANDAs through asset acquisitions, including, most recently, the U.S. portfolio of 23 generic products, including 10 commercial products at the time of the acquisition, from Amerigen Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. We also focus on niche lower competition opportunities such as injectables and Paragraph IV filings. Additionally, we will seek opportunities to enhance our research and development capabilities through strategic partnerships and acquisitions of businesses. 
​
​
Maximizing the value from our established brands through innovative “go-to-market” (“GTM”) strategies and continued programmatic acquisitions
​
We have acquired the NDAs for and market Atacand, Atacand HCT, Arimidex, Casodex, Lithobid, Vancocin, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, and InnoPran XL. We are innovating in our GTM strategy through creative partnerships. In addition, we will continue to explore opportunities in acquiring new brands to grow our established brands portfolio.
​
Expansion of contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) business by leveraging our unique manufacturing capabilities
We built a CDMO business through our sites in Baudette and grew it through the acquisition of WellSpring Pharma Services Inc. (“ANI Canada”). Our North America based manufacturing and unique capabilities in high-potency, hormonal, steroid, and oncolytic products can be leveraged to expand our CDMO business. 
The pillars of our strategy will be enabled by an empowered, collaborative, and purposeful team with high performance-orientation. We will also retain our continued programmatic approach to inorganic growth initiatives.
Product Development Considerations
We consider a variety of criteria in determining which products to develop or acquire, all of which relate to the level of potential competition and expected profitability upon product launch. Below are the principal criteria we consider.

● | Formulation Complexity. Our development and manufacturing capabilities enable us to manufacture pharmaceuticals that are difficult to produce, including highly potent, extended release, combination, and low dosage products. This ability to manufacture a variety of complex products is a competitive strength that we intend to continue to leverage in selecting products to develop or manufacture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Status. We seek to develop products whose branded bioequivalents do not have long-term patent protection or existing patent challenges.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Market Size. When determining whether to develop or acquire an individual product, we review the current and expected market size for that product at launch, as well as forecasted price erosion upon conversion from branded to generic pricing. We endeavor to manufacture products with sufficient market size to enable us to enter the market with a strong likelihood of being able to price our products both competitively and at a profit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Profit Potential. We research the availability and cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients in determining which products to develop or acquire. In determining the potential profit of a product, we forecast our anticipated market share, pricing, including the expected price erosion caused by competition from other generic manufacturers, and the estimated cost to manufacture the products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Manufacturing. We generally seek to develop and manufacture products at our own manufacturing plants in order to optimize the utilization of our facilities, ensure quality control in our products, and maximize profit potential.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competition. When determining whether to develop or acquire a product, we research existing and expected competition. We seek to develop products for which we can obtain sufficient market share and may decline to develop a product if we anticipate significant competition. Our specialized manufacturing facilities provide a means of entering niche markets, such as hormone therapies, in which fewer generic companies are able to compete.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to laboratories that support the requirements of raw material, finished product, and stability testing, we have a 1,000-square foot pilot laboratory offering liquid, suspension and solid dose development capabilities. This pilot laboratory offers a full range of analytical capabilities, including method development, validation and de-formulation, and is licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). Finally, a separate development suite located within our high-potency manufacturing facility offers additional capabilities for product development.
Products and Markets
Products
A complete list of our generic and branded pharmaceutical products and descriptions is posted on our website, www.anipharmaceuticals.com. 
Markets 
In determining which products to pursue for development, we target products that are complex to manufacture and therefore have higher barriers to entry. These factors provide opportunities for growth, utilizing our competitive strengths at the same time that they decrease the number of potential competitors in the markets for these products. These markets currently include controlled substances, oncology products, hormones and steroids, injectables, and complex formulations, including extended release and combination products.
Controlled Substances
Schedule II controlled substances are drugs considered to have a high abuse risk but that also have safe and accepted medical uses. In addition to our four Schedule II products currently on the market, our pipeline includes two ANDAs in this market. One of our manufacturing facilities in Baudette, Minnesota is licensed by the DEA for the manufacture of Schedule II controlled substances. Our manufacturing facility in Oakville, Ontario is licensed by Health Canada for the manufacture of Schedule II controlled substances.
Oncology Products
Due to the capabilities of our containment facility and our expertise in manufacturing segregation, we are focused on developing and manufacturing niche oncology products (anti-cancer). In particular, we are targeting products subject to priority review by the FDA, more specifically those with no blocking patents and no generic competition. We currently have five oncology products on the market.
Hormone and Steroid Drugs
The market for hormone and steroid drugs includes hormone therapy to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women, contraceptives, testosterone replacement therapies for men, and therapies for treating hormone-sensitive cancers.

5



Hormone Therapy (“HT”) has been a long-accepted medical treatment for alleviating the symptoms of menopause. Initially, HT consisted of estrogen only but has evolved to include combination therapies of estrogen, progesterone, and androgens. We target niche products in the HT and steroid product market for several reasons, including:

● | Hormone and steroid products are a core competency based on our manufacturing and product development teams’ long history of manufacturing these types of products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The aging “baby boomer” population, of which women represent a majority, is expected to support continued growth in the HT market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Injectables
Our burgeoning injectable portfolio contains five injectable ANDA products encompassing several key therapeutic areas. Additionally, Cortrophin Gel would be our first branded injectable product if we obtained approval for this product. We work with world-class manufacturing partners to support these efforts. 

Complex Formulations
In addition to our 18 complex formulation products currently on the market, our pipeline includes 10 extended-release products and seven combination products.
Contract Manufacturing
We manufacture pharmaceutical products for several branded and generic companies, who outsource production in order to:

● | Free-up internal resources to focus on sales and marketing as well as research and development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employ internal capacity to manufacture higher volume or more critical products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize our specialized equipment and expertise.
--+-------------------------------------------------

Given our specialized manufacturing capabilities, we are focused on attracting niche contract manufacturing opportunities that offer high margins.
In conjunction with our acquisition of WellSpring Pharma Services Inc., we acquired WellSpring’s pharmaceutical manufacturing facility. As a result of this transaction, we perform contract manufacturing in both our Baudette, Minnesota and Oakville, Ontario facilities.
Manufacturing, Suppliers, and Raw Materials
We require a supply of quality raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), and components to manufacture and package our pharmaceutical products. In order to manufacture certain of our products deemed controlled substances, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of API needed for manufacture. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers.
We source the raw materials for our products from both domestic and international suppliers, which we carefully select. Generally, we qualify only a single source of API for use in each product due to the cost and time required to validate and qualify a second source of supply. Any change in one of our API suppliers must usually be approved through a Prior Approval Supplement (“PAS”) by the FDA. The process of obtaining an approval of such a PAS can require between four and 18 months. While we also generally qualify a single source for non-API raw materials, the process required to qualify an alternative source of a non-API raw material is typically much less rigorous. If we were to change the supplier of a raw material for a product, the cost for the material could be greater than the amount we paid 

6



with the previous supplier. Changes in suppliers are rare but could occur as a result of a supplier’s business failing, an issue arising from an FDA inspection, or failure to maintain our required standards of quality. As a result, we selectively choose suppliers based on various factors including quality, reliability of supply, and long-term financial stability. 
Certain of the APIs for our drug products, including those that are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs, are sourced from international suppliers. From time to time, we have experienced temporary disruptions in the supply of certain of such imported API due to FDA inspections. In addition, certain of our products are manufactured, packaged, or manufactured and packaged by third parties.
Government Regulation
The pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. and Canada is highly regulated by multiple U.S. and Canadian government agencies, such as the FDA, the DEA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and Health Canada. As a result, we are subject to extensive and complex rules and regulations, which are subject to revision from time to time. While we have experience with these regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully comply with all applicable regulations.
In April 2020, the FDA issued an RTF letter for our sNDA for Cortrophin Gel. Since this time, our efforts have been focused on the preparation of a complete resubmission of the sNDA. We immediately retained a prominent regulatory consulting firm to support our efforts and augment the capabilities of our internal Cortrophin development team. In addition, we restructured the composition of the internal team. We have performed a comprehensive review of the original sNDA filing and prepared an internal gap assessment and execution plan to address these gaps. The resultant remediation activities are currently in-progress.
Branded and Generic Pharmaceutical Products
All prescription pharmaceutical products distributed in the U.S., whether branded or generic, must be approved by the FDA. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, and quality control. Information to support the bioequivalence of generic drug products or the safety and effectiveness of new drug products for their intended use is also required to be submitted. There are generally two types of applications used for obtaining FDA approval of new products:
New Drug Application (“NDA”)—An NDA is filed when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and, in certain instances, for a new dosage form, a new delivery system, or a new indication for an approved drug. 
Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”)—An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug approved under an NDA. 
The ANDA development process is generally less time-consuming and less complex than the NDA development process. It typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the branded drug approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, typically requires one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed drug (“RLD”).
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) provides that generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA, which requires (1) that bioequivalence to the branded product be demonstrated through clinical studies, and (2) either the expiration, invalidation or circumvention of any patents or the end of any other relevant market exclusivity periods related to the branded drug.
Accordingly, generic products generally provide a safe, effective, and cost-efficient alternative to users of branded products. Growth in the generic pharmaceutical industry has been driven by the increased market acceptance of generic drugs, as well as the number of branded drugs for which patent terms and/or other market exclusivities have expired.

7



Generic products are generally commercialized after the expiration of patent protection for the branded product and after the end of a period of non-patent market exclusivity. In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a generic product. Also, if the NDA is a new chemical entity (“NCE”), the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the NCE. If an NDA is not an NCE, but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve a generic equivalent to the NDA for three years. Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the branded drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications.
In order to obtain FDA approval of NDAs and ANDAs, our manufacturing procedures and operations must conform to FDA requirements and guidelines, generally referred to as “cGMP.” The requirements for FDA approval encompass all aspects of the production process, including validation and recordkeeping, the standards around which are continuously changing and evolving. As a result, we must consistently monitor and comply with these changes.
Our facilities, procedures, operations, and testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the DEA, Health Canada, and other authorities. In addition, the FDA and Health Canada conduct pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA and Health Canada regulations. Our suppliers are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.
Controlled Substances
The DEA regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). Certain of our products contain significant components that are classified as controlled substances. CSA and DEA regulations impose specific requirements on manufacturers and other entities that handle these substances including registration, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, security, and distribution. Recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received, manufactured, stored, and distributed. Companies handling controlled substances also are required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders, thefts, and significant losses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of API needed to manufacture certain of our products deemed controlled substances. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers. As a result, we are dependent upon the DEA to approve quotas large enough to support our continued manufacture of our controlled substances at commercial level. See “Risk Factors ― We are entirely dependent on periodic approval by the DEA for the supply of the API needed to manufacture our controlled substances. An inability to obtain such approvals would reduce or eliminate our revenues for our controlled substances, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results. In addition, we are subject to strict regulation by the DEA and are subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with related regulatory requirements.”
Unapproved Products
Two of our products, EEMT and Opium Tincture, are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs. Previously, the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (“FDA’s”) Unapproved Drug Initiative included publication of their policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products in the September 2011 Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 440.100 titled “Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or ANDAs.” Under this policy, the FDA had stated that it would follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products. The guideline allowed the FDA to evaluate whether to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, while giving higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories, such as those with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. In November 2020 (effective December 2020), the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) published a notice in the Federal Register to terminate the FDA’s Unapproved Drug Initiative, which would include the withdrawal of this September 2011 Compliance Policy Guide. Neither the HHS nor the FDA has provided any additional guidance, notice or statement regarding how they intend to approach enforcement against 

8



marketing of unapproved products. We continue to believe that, so long as we comply with applicable manufacturing standards, the FDA will continue to operate on a risk-based approach and will not take action against us. However, we can offer no assurance that the FDA will continue to follow this approach or that it will not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, revenues for EEMT were 7%, 9%, and 11% of total revenue, respectively, and revenues from Opium Tincture were 1% of total revenue. See “Risk Factors – Two of our products, which together comprised 8% of our total revenue in 2020, are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs and we can offer no assurances that the FDA will not require us to either seek approval for these products or withdraw them from the market. In either case, our business, financial position, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.”
Medicaid/Medicare
Medicaid and Medicare, both of which are U.S. federal health care programs administered by CMS, are major purchasers of pharmaceutical products, including those we produce.
Medicaid is administered by the states and jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Its focus is on low income populations. State drug coverage policies under Medicaid may vary significantly state by state. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, together known as the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), required states to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Although the United States Supreme Court in 2011 made the Medicaid expansion optional, many states are expanding their Medicaid programs.
The ACA also made changes to Medicaid law that has negatively impacted our business. In particular, pharmaceutical manufacturers must enter into rebate agreements with state Medicaid agencies, which require manufacturers to pay rebates based on their drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACA raised the rebate percentages for both generic and branded pharmaceuticals effective January 1, 2010. The required rebate is currently 13% of the average manufacturer price for sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under ANDAs. Sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under NDAs require manufacturers to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between the average manufacturer price and the “best price” (as defined in the Medicaid statute) during a specific period. Federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to the Medicaid program.
Medicare is run by the federal government and is largely focused on the elderly and disabled. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) created Medicare Part D to provide prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA has increased usage of pharmaceuticals, a trend that we believe will continue to benefit the generic pharmaceutical industry. The ACA made some changes to Part D to make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries to obtain drugs, such as reducing coinsurance amounts. The ACA also required pharmaceutical companies to provide discounts to Medicare Part D beneficiaries for the cost of branded prescription drugs. The ACA created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program, any pharmaceutical product marketed under an NDA, regardless of whether the product is marketed as a “generic,” is subject to the discount requirement. Our Candesartan Hydrochlorothiazide, Fenofibrate, Fluvoxamine, Hydrocortisone Enema, Lithium Carbonate ER, Mesalamine, Propranolol ER, Terbutaline, and Vancomycin products, while marketed as “generics,” are marketed under approved NDAs and, therefore, are subject to the discount requirement. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the ACA is currently subject to a broad legal challenge in California vs. Azar before the U.S. Supreme Court. Additionally, in November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Were the Supreme Court to invalidate the ACA, that could have far-reaching consequences of an uncertain nature for our industry. However, the Biden administration and Democratically-controlled Congress are expected to take significant action to mitigate any ruling against the Affordable 

9



Care Act. Further, the administration and Congress are expected to take steps towards expanding health care coverage beyond the ACA, which could have ramifications for the pharmaceutical industry.
Most of our products are covered by Medicaid and Medicare. Our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any determination that we have failed to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions, and we could be subject to federal or state false claims litigation.
There has also been recent heightened federal governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the last Presidential administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
We own the trademark names for most of our branded products, including Cortenema, Cortrophin gel, Cortrophin-Zinc, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, Lithobid, Reglan, and Vancocin. We license the trademark names for Atacand, Atacand HCT, Arimidex, and Casodex. With the exception of a license for patent technology for InnoPran XL and Inderal XL, we do not own or license any patents associated with these products. Further, patent protection and market exclusivity for these branded products have expired, with the exception of the InnoPran XL and Inderal XL products, which have market exclusivity until 2022. Therefore, we consider the trademark names to be of material value and we act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single trademark. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used, and in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely. We believe that sales of our branded products have benefited and will continue to benefit from the value of the product name. 
In addition, we receive royalties from a license for patent rights initially owned by Cell Genesys, Inc., which merged with BioSante in 2009. The royalties are received as a result of sales and milestones related to the Yescarta® product. In 2020, we recorded $1.4 million of royalties related to the license of these patent rights. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Distribution Agreements
In addition to selling products under our own NDAs and ANDAs, we enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties in which we sell products under ANDAs or NDAs owned or licensed by these third parties. These products are sold under our own label.

10



Customers
Our customers purchase and distribute our products. Our products are sold by three major retail pharmacy chains: CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens. Our customers include five major national wholesalers: AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, McKesson, Smith Drug Company, and Morris Dickson. In addition, our customers include national mail order houses, including CVS Caremark, Humana, and ExpressScripts, as well as group purchasing organizations.
In recent years, the wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 74% of our net revenues were attributable to three wholesalers: AmerisourceBergen Corporation 31%, McKesson Corporation 24%, and Cardinal Health, Inc. 19%. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, together accounted for approximately 80% and 81% of our net revenues, respectively. In addition, as noted below, our customers also distribute our products. The loss of any of these customers, including in their role as distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Due to a strategic partnership between Amerisource Bergen and Walgreens, Amerisource Bergen handles product distribution for Walgreens. Similarly, Cardinal Health and CVS established a partnership in which Cardinal performs some product distribution for CVS. McKesson also entered into a strategic alliance with both Wal-Mart and Rite Aid. As a result of these strategic partnerships between wholesalers and pharmacy chains, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increases in net sales to the wholesalers, with corresponding decreases in net sales to the pharmacy chains.
Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Critical Accounting Estimates" for a discussion of our accruals for chargebacks, rebates, returns, and other allowances.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
We market, sell, and distribute our products in the United States. Our products are distributed through the following channels:

● | Wholesalers. We conduct business with five major wholesalers in the United States: AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal, McKesson, Smith Drug Company, and Morris Dickson.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Retail Market Chains. We conduct business with three major retail chains in the United States: CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distributors and Mail Order Pharmacies. We have contracts with several major distributors and mail order pharmacies in the United States, including Anda, CVS Caremark, Humana, and ExpressScripts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Group Purchasing Organizations. We have contracts with group purchasing organizations in the United States, such as ClarusONE, Rx Sourcing Strategies, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development Group, Red Oak Sourcing, Premier Inc., Managed Health Care Associates Inc., Innovatix, MedAssets, Minnesota Multi-State, Optisource, The Premier Group, and Kaiser Permanente Purchasing Organization.

Competition
Certain of our products face limited competition due to complexities in formulation, active pharmaceutical ingredient sourcing, materials handling and manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles. Nevertheless, we compete with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, including large, global pharmaceutical manufacturers capable of addressing these complexities and hurdles with respect to products that we currently produce and products that are in our pipeline. In addition, our products are subject to competition from other generic products and non-prescription alternative therapies.
Our branded pharmaceutical products currently face competition from generic products and we expect them to continue to face competition from generic products in the future. In order to launch a generic product, a manufacturer must apply to the FDA for an ANDA showing that the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD. (See “Government Regulation.”)
The primary means of competition among generic drug manufacturers are pricing, contract terms, service levels, and reliability. To compete effectively, we seek to consistently produce high-quality, reliable, and effective products. We also establish active working relationships with each of our customers, continually gather important market information in order to respond successfully to requests for proposals, maintain sufficient inventories to assure high service levels, and work to reduce product costs by sourcing and qualifying alternative suppliers whenever possible.
Over the past several years, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced significant consolidation, particularly in distribution channels and among generic and brand drug companies.
The wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels, which results in pricing pressure on our business and can result in a shift in sales to our competitors.
In addition, consolidation among pharmaceutical companies has created opportunities by reducing the number of competitors. However, as competitors grow larger through consolidation, so do their resources. Larger competitors may be able to aggressively decrease prices in order to gain market share on certain products and may have resources that would allow them to market their products more effectively to potential customers.
Our sales can also be impacted by new studies that indicate that a competitor’s product has greater efficacy than one of our products. If competitors introduce new products with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales.
Principal competitors for the pharmaceutical market in which we do business include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alvogen, Inc., Apotex Inc., Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Hikma Pharmaceuticals plc, Method Pharmaceuticals, LLC, Mylan N.V., Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Perrigo Company plc, Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.
Product Liability
Product liability litigation represents an inherent risk to all firms in the pharmaceutical industry. We utilize traditional third-party insurance policies with regard to our product liability claims. Such insurance coverage at any given time reflects current market conditions, including cost and availability, when the policy is written.
Human Capital
As of January 2021, we have 369 employees, of which 250 are located in the United States and another 119 are located in Canada. We occasionally use a small number of part-time and consultant resources to meet our operational

needs and are generally not impacted by significant turnover year-to-year. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment within all levels of the business.
Attracting and retaining talented employees is critical to the success of our business, especially at our manufacturing operations in Baudette, Minnesota, which is located in a sparsely populated area of Northern Minnesota, with a population of less than 5,000. As a result, it can be challenging to find sufficiently qualified personnel in all functional areas. To address this, we support remote working arrangements for a number of employees in several functions throughout the business, including at the executive level. Additionally, our compensation plans are designed to be competitive within the pharmaceuticals industry as well as competitive with local employers for jobs of a cross-industry nature. Our approach provides ANI with the resources to recognize and reward employee performance, productivity, and quality commitment. Our total compensation program includes competitive base salaries, comprehensive benefits, and employee equity programs. 
Our U.S. and Canada facilities are committed to the safety and health of our employees, patient-customers and the general public. It is critical within our mission to ensure we keep our employees and customers safe while accomplishing our business goals. We accomplish these initiatives through the following:
Health and Safety Management and Training
ANI has established a health and safety program with a focus on continuous improvement and employee engagement. ANI personnel are encouraged to take corrective actions where appropriate and to communicate concerns to management with a “see something, say something” approach. We recognize and reward personnel for contributing to the safety system within our working environment. The overall program continually evolves to reflect regulatory changes and compliance standard industry best practices. As part of onboarding new employees, we provide health and safety training and periodic training programs to maintain and improve employee awareness of safety issues. The goal of the safety training programs is to ensure that our staff are well informed on the subject matters and have the appropriate tools to make sound health and safety decisions in our day-to-day operations.
Environmental Stewardship
ANI is committed to minimizing waste and emissions, promoting reuse and recycling and conserving resources, where feasible, to reduce our environmental footprint on our environment.
COVID-19 Actions
Our U.S. and Canada facilities quickly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a COVID-19 action plan to protect the health and safety of our employees as they performed their duties, as all of our facilities have remained open during the pandemic. Measures include social distancing requirements, increased and expanded sanitation for both employees and our property, face covering requirements for employees and visitors, staggered work schedules to minimize contact, flexible and work-from-home schedules, and employee illness and exposure protocols. These measures also seek to comply with all county, state, province, and/or city mandates as they relate to COVID-19. Please refer to Part I, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
