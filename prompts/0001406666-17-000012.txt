ITEM 1. | Business

Overview
Calix, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Calix," the "Company," "our," "we," or "us") was incorporated in August 1999 and is a Delaware corporation. We are a leading global provider of broadband communications access platforms, systems and software for fiber- and copper-based network architectures and a pioneer in software defined access that enable communications service providers ("CSPs") to transform their networks and enhance how they connect to their residential and business subscribers. We enable CSPs to provide a wide range of revenue-generating services, from basic voice and data to advanced broadband services, over legacy and next-generation access networks. We focus solely on CSP access networks, the portion of the network that governs available bandwidth and determines the range and quality of services that can be offered to subscribers. We develop and sell carrier-class hardware and cloud products that are designed to enhance and transform CSP access networks to meet the changing demands of subscribers rapidly and cost-effectively. Our most advanced systems operate on Access eXtensible Operating System ("AXOS"), a network operating system and software platform built for the specific needs of the access network that allows for all software functions in the access network to be developed and run without dependence on underlying hardware and associated silicon chipsets.
The Calix portfolio consists of three core systems and/or nodes: E-Series access systems and nodes ("E-Series systems and nodes"), B6 access nodes ("B-Series nodes"), and the C7 multiservice, multiprotocol access system ("C-Series system"). These systems and nodes are complemented by the P-Series optical network terminals ("ONTs") and residential gateways, the GigaFamily of GigaCenters, GigaHubs, and GigaPoints, the Calix Management System ("CMS"), OpenLink Cable software and Compass Cloud family of software-as-a-service products. Our broad and comprehensive portfolio serves the CSP network from the central office or data center to the subscriber premises and enables CSPs to deliver voice, high-speed data and an unmatched broadband experience over legacy and next-generation access networks. These packet-based systems and nodes are complemented by Compass Cloud to enable CSPs to rapidly introduce new revenue-generating services while minimizing the capital and operational costs of CSP networks. The Calix portfolio allows CSPs to evolve their networks and service delivery capabilities at a pace that balances their financial, competitive and technological needs.
We believe that the rapid growth of Internet and data traffic, introduction of bandwidth-intensive advanced broadband services, such as gigabit-speed Internet, Internet protocol television ("IPTV") and over-the-top ("OTT") video, mobile broadband, high-definition and ultra high-definition video, and online gaming, the rise of the cloud as a mainstream vehicle for content delivery over broadband, the proliferation of broadband-ready consumer devices, and the increasingly competitive market for residential and business subscribers are driving CSPs to invest in and upgrade their access networks. We also believe that CSPs will gradually transform their access networks to deliver these advanced broadband services over fiber-based networks complemented by advanced wireless technologies, thereby preparing networks for continued bandwidth growth, the introduction of new services and more cost-effective operations. During this time, CSPs will increasingly deploy new fiber-based network infrastructure to enable this transition while continuing to support basic voice and data services over legacy networks. Our portfolio is designed to enable this evolution of the access network efficiently and flexibly.
We market our access systems and related software to CSPs globally through our direct sales force as well as a limited number of international resellers. As of December 31, 2016, over 23 million ports of the Calix portfolio have been deployed at a growing number of CSPs worldwide. Our customers include many of the world's largest communications providers. In addition, we have enabled over 1,300 customers to deploy gigabit passive optical network, Active Ethernet and point-to-point Ethernet fiber access networks.
We have a single reportable operating segment. Additional information about geographic areas required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 13, "Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Background
CSPs compete in a rapidly changing market to deliver a range of voice, data and video services to their residential and business subscribers. CSPs include wireline and wireless service providers, cable multiple system operators ("MSOs"), electrical cooperatives, and municipalities. The rise in Internet-enabled communications has created an environment in which CSPs are competing to deliver voice, data and video offerings to their subscribers across fixed and mobile networks. Residential and business subscribers now have the opportunity to purchase an array of services such as basic voice and data as well as advanced broadband services such as high-speed Internet, IPTV, mobile broadband, high-definition and ultra high-definition video, OTT video, and online gaming from a variety of CSPs. The rapid growth in new services is generating increased network traffic.
For example, Cisco Systems, Inc. estimates that global IP traffic will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22% per year from 2015 to reach approximately 194 exabytes per month in 2020. We believe that increased network traffic will be largely driven by video applications, which are expected to account for 85% of global consumer traffic by 2020. CSPs are also broadening their offerings of bandwidth-intensive advanced broadband services, while maintaining support for their widely utilized basic voice and data services. CSPs are being driven to evolve their access networks to enable cost-effective delivery of a broad range of services demanded by their subscribers.
With strong subscriber demand for low latency and bandwidth-intensive applications, CSPs are seeking to offer new services, realize new revenue streams, build out new infrastructure and differentiate themselves from their competitors. CSPs typically compete on their cost to acquire and retain subscribers, the quality of their service offerings, including such measures as the speed, latency, and reliability of their broadband services, and the cost to deploy and operate their networks. In the past, CSPs offered different solutions delivered over distinct networks designed for specific services and were generally not in direct competition. For example, traditional wireline service providers

provided voice services while cable MSOs delivered cable television services. Currently, CSPs are increasingly offering services that leverage Internet protocol ("IP"), thereby enabling CSPs of all types to offer a comprehensive bundle of IP-based voice, data and video services to their subscribers. This has increased the level of competition among CSPs as wireline and wireless service providers, cable MSOs and other CSPs can all compete for the same residential and business subscribers using similar types of IP-based services. Over the last few years, Google has been selectively overbuilding major U.S. cities with fiber and delivering data and video service packages that include symmetrical 1 gigabit per second (gigabit) high-speed data services. Google's program has spurred both traditional wireline service providers and cable MSOs to invest in gigabit capable networks in both the Google serviced cities as well as other communities around the world.
Access Networks are Critical and Strategic to CSPs and Policymakers
Access networks, also known as the local loop or last mile, directly and physically connect the residential or business subscriber to the CSP's data center, central office or similar facilities. The access network is critical for service delivery as it governs the bandwidth capacity, service quality available to subscribers and ultimately the services and experience CSPs can provide to subscribers. Connecting the cloud to a growing number of broadband-ready consumer devices and providing differentiated, high-speed, high quality connectivity has become increasingly critical for CSPs to retain and expand their subscriber base and to launch new services. Typically, subscribers consider overall broadband service experience, including service breadth, bandwidth speed, latency, reliability, price, ease of use and technical support as key factors in the decision to purchase services from a CSP. As CSPs face increasing pressure to retain their basic voice and data customers in response to competitive CSPs offering voice, data and video services, it is critical for CSPs to continue to invest in and upgrade their access networks in order to maintain a compelling broadband service experience, drive new revenue opportunities and maintain and grow their subscriber base. Access networks can meaningfully affect the ongoing success of CSPs.
Governments around the world recognize the importance of expanding broadband networks and delivering advanced broadband services to more people and businesses. As a result, many governments are establishing one-time stimulus programs or other incentives for broadband investment on an on-going basis. In the United States, programs like the Connect America Fund ("CAF") and E-Rate provide billions of dollars each year to CSPs in the form of capital investment incentives, grants, and loans targeted at encouraging broadband network investment in unserved or underserved communities and schools. In 2015 for example, the CAF program was authorized to distribute $3.8 billion to offset the costs of installing and operating CSP operated broadband and voice networks, and the E-Rate program was authorized to offer $1.5 billion in grants to build gigabit capable network connections to schools. The CAF program is funded to distribute this same amount of funds to CSPs through 2020, and the E-Rate program targeted at networks is funded at its current level indefinitely. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 2016 created a $750 million fund targeted at increasing broadband coverage and speeds, and the European Commission is pursuing similar goals via its Connecting Europe Facility and other programs.
Limitations of Traditional Access Networks
CSPs rely on the capabilities and quality of their access networks, as well as network data analytics, to sustain their businesses and relationships with their subscribers through an enhanced subscriber experience. In the past, subscribers had little influence over the types of services provided by CSPs. Today, subscribers can be more selective among CSPs, and these device-enabled subscribers are increasingly demanding advanced broadband services on both a wireline and wireless basis in addition to basic voice and data services. In general, access networks are highly capital intensive and CSPs have historically upgraded capacity as technology and subscriber demands on their networks have changed. We believe CSPs will increasingly integrate fiber-and Ethernet-based access networks to enable the delivery of more advanced broadband services at a lower cost while at the same time enabling the continued delivery of basic voice and data services. Thus far, CSPs have taken an incremental approach to capacity upgrades in their access networks. As a result, CSPs face multiple challenges concerning their access networks, business models and service delivery capabilities, including:

• | A Complex Patchwork of Networks and Technologies — In order to upgrade their access networks, CSPs have typically added networks for new residential or business services that they deliver, such as digital subscriber line ("DSL") or G.fast, data over cable service interface specification ("DOCSIS"), GPON or Gigabit Ethernet, on top of existing networks. This led to an overbuild of access technologies and an unnecessarily complex patchwork of physical connections between the central office or data center and the subscriber. In addition, CSPs have expanded the penetration of fiber into their access networks, thereby shortening the length of the subscriber connection through lower bandwidth media types (such as copper-based or coaxial cable-based networks). CSPs have also attempted to evolve their access networks to enable more efficient packet-based services by adding Ethernet protocol on top of existing asynchronous transfer mode ("ATM") and DSL protocols. In addition, CSPs have often deployed separate equipment to facilitate the delivery of synchronous optical networking ("SONET"), Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet transport, which connects CSP central offices and data centers with their access networks, further increasing the complexity and the cost of their networks. This approach has left most CSPs with disparate architectures, features, functions and capabilities in different parts of their networks. This increasingly complex, patchwork approach to deploying access networks and delivering new services to their subscribers has created potential complications for CSPs within their access networks. These potential complications limit data transmission capability, increase the cost of operation and maintenance and can negatively impact the subscriber experience.


• | Limited Capacity from Legacy Access Architectures — Legacy access network architectures were designed to address earlier-generation communication demands of wireline telephone, cable television and cellular services. Such access networks have physical limitations in their ability to scale bandwidth, avoid latency issues and deliver the advanced broadband services subscribers demand today and are expected to increasingly demand in the future. In addition, CSPs understand the need to add fiber to their networks to provide the bandwidth required to scale advanced broadband services. However, it is costly and complex to integrate fiber-based technologies into legacy access networks.

5


• | Inflexible Technologies Increase Network Switching Costs — Legacy access networks were architected around a narrow set of technologies. For example, traditional voice calls use circuit switching technology to allocate a fixed amount of network capacity to each call, regardless of whether such capacity is fully utilized. The emergence of packet-based technologies, primarily IP and Ethernet, has significantly improved the ability to transmit data efficiently across networks as bandwidth is only consumed when signals are actually being transmitted. Most legacy access networks do not allow circuit- and packet-based technologies to co-exist or to evolve from one technology to another.


• | Inefficient Service Roll-out Constrains Subscriber Offerings — Legacy access networks were designed to support a narrow range of services, and as a result, they limit the ability of CSPs to provision the advanced broadband services increasingly demanded by their subscribers. Packet-based networks are more flexible and efficient than traditional circuit-switched networks. For example, to provision additional business services in a legacy access network, a CSP would typically deploy additional physical connections and equipment, while packet-based infrastructure allows a CSP to change or add services virtually without the presence of a service technician or the installation of new equipment. In order to deploy these services quickly and efficiently, CSPs must be able to utilize their existing infrastructure while upgrading the legacy access network to packet-based technologies.


• | Highly Reliable Access Products are Difficult to Engineer and Manage — Given the critical nature of access networks and their typical deployment in remote and distant locations, access infrastructure products must be highly reliable. Unlike most other communications equipment which is deployed in environmentally controlled data centers, central offices or similar facilities, a great deal of access equipment is deployed in outdoor environments and must be specifically engineered to operate in variable and often extremely harsh conditions, as well as fit into smaller spaces, such as on a street corner, near office buildings or on the side of a house or cellular tower. Since the access portion of the network is broadly distributed, it is expensive as well as difficult to manage and maintain. CSPs require access network equipment that can perform reliably in these uncontrolled environments and be deployed in a variety of form factors, thereby adding significant engineering and product development challenges as compared to most other forms of communications infrastructure equipment. In addition, some portion of the access market is supported by government initiatives and products sold into this segment require additional government certifications and approvals in order to qualify for deployment.


• | Expensive to Deploy and Operate — As a result of deploying multiple networks with discrete functions, legacy access networks require a wide variety of equipment to be installed, maintained and ultimately replaced, thereby placing a significant and recurring capital and operating expense burden on the CSP. Once installed, this equipment occupies valuable space inside a data center or central office, requires frequent labor-intensive maintenance and consumes meaningful amounts of power. Moreover, the lack of integration across protocols and fiber- and copper-based network architectures negatively impacts network performance. Inferior network performance diminishes the subscriber experience and increases network operating costs by increasing service calls, the number of required support staff and the frequency of equipment upgrades and replacements.


• | Onerous Backoffice Systems Slow Deployment of New Technologies and Services — Traditional methods for operationalizing new products and services often require significant testing and lengthy backoffice integration activities, often directly proportional to the size of the CSP. This often places CSPs at a competitive disadvantage when competing with emerging service providers that can leverage for streamlined or virtualized processes. Emerging frameworks like Software Defined Networking ("SDN") and Network Functions Virtualization ("NFV") can help CSPs overcome these operational challenges and bring new products and services to market faster.

Given these limitations of legacy access networks, we believe CSPs will over time increasingly emphasize fiber- and Ethernet-based technologies and frameworks like SDN and NFV in their access networks thereby enabling the rapid, cost-effective deployment of advanced broadband services. Such technologies and frameworks reduce overhead expenses, simplify network architectures and seamlessly integrate legacy and next-generation networks. We therefore believe that successful CSPs will be those that evolve from providing basic subscriber connectivity to providing the most relevant services and subscriber experience.
The Calix Solution
We are a leading global provider of broadband communications access platforms, systems and software for fiber- and copper-based network architectures and a pioneer in software defined access that enable CSPs to transform their networks and enhance how they connect to their residential and business subscribers. The Calix portfolio enables CSPs to quickly meet subscriber demands for both basic voice and data as well as advanced broadband and Wi-Fi services, while providing CSPs with the flexibility to optimize and transform their networks at a pace that balances their financial, competitive and technological needs. Our systems and software leverage packet-based technologies that enable CSPs to offer a wide range of revenue-generating services, regardless of protocol or network connection media. Our portfolio consists of our E-Series systems and nodes, as well as our B-Series nodes and C-Series system. These systems and nodes are complemented by the P-Series ONTs and residential gateways; the GigaFamily of premises service delivery centers, hubs, and points; CMS; Open Link Cable software and the Compass Cloud family of software-as-as-service products.
We believe that the Calix portfolio of network and premises-based solutions provides the following benefits to CSPs:

• | Single Intelligent Access Network for Basic and Advanced Services — The Calix portfolio allows for a broad range of subscriber services to be provisioned and delivered over a single unified network. These systems can deliver basic voice and data, advanced broadband services, including high-speed Internet, IPTV, mobile broadband, high-definition video and online gaming, as well as integrated transport within our portfolio, all of which can be monitored and managed by Compass Cloud. In addition, our systems can be deployed in both small and large form factors across multiple deployment scenarios depending on subscriber proximity and service requirements. Introduced in 2014, the Open Link Cable software solution provides cable MSOs with the operational advantage of being able to provision GPON services via their traditional DOCSIS back office infrastructure. These are examples of our multiservice approach that allows CSPs to utilize their legacy access networks during the course of their equipment upgrade

6

and network transformation, saving them time and money in delivering both basic voice and data and advanced broadband services.

• | High Capacity and Operational Efficiency — The Calix portfolio is designed to facilitate the evolution of CSP access networks to fiber- and Ethernet-based network architectures. Our portfolio includes systems and nodes that exceed the capacity of the products of our competitors. Our systems and nodes are designed and optimized for fiber- and copper-based network architectures. We also have a broad portfolio of fiber ONTs and GigaFamily products that serve as the on-premises gateways and service delivery platforms for new services to subscribers. Many of our ONTs auto-detect fiber access technologies, support both GPON and point-to-point Gigabit Ethernet, and can co-exist with next generation PON technologies to provide CSPs additional cost and management efficiencies.


• | Highly Flexible Technology Solutions — The Calix portfolio enables CSPs to utilize legacy access network infrastructure during their migration towards fiber- and Ethernet-based access networks. Our portfolio supports multiple protocols, different form factors and modular options optimized for a variety of installation locations and environments, and multiple services delivered over fiber- and copper-based network architectures.


• | Seamless Transition to Advanced Services — The Calix portfolio enables CSPs to better manage the evolution of their access networks by transitioning the delivery of basic voice and data services to advanced broadband services. Our C-Series system supports ongoing demand for basic voice and data services, and facilitates a seamless and controlled migration to IP-based services. For CSPs without legacy network constraints, our E-Series and B-Series systems allow CSPs to deploy advanced broadband services rapidly and cost effectively to their subscribers.


• | Highly Reliable and Purpose-Built Solutions for Demands of Access — The Calix portfolio is designed for high availability and purpose-built for the demands of access network deployments. Our carrier class products are environmentally hardened and field-tested to be capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions, including temperatures between -40 and 65 degrees Celsius, extremely dry or wet conditions and physical abuse. Our access systems are built and tested to meet or exceed network equipment-building system standards, which are a set of safety, spatial and environmental design guidelines for telecommunications equipment. Our products are highly compatible and designed to be easily integrated into the existing operational and management infrastructure of CSP access networks. Our portfolio can be deployed in multiple form factors and power configurations to address a wide range of deployment scenarios influenced by space and power constraints.


• | An Operating System and Software Platform Built to Meet the Emerging Demands of the Access Network — Our AXOS platform is an architecture built to leverage the best of data center software design and network virtualization in the challenging environment and variability of the ever-changing access network. Completely hardware independent, AXOS allows for all software functions in the access network to be developed and run without dependence on the underlying hardware and associated silicon chipsets. This always-on architecture and consistent provisioning of services accelerates time-to-revenue, reduces service disruptions, and reduces operational complexity for service providers.


• | Compelling Customer Value Proposition — We believe the Calix portfolio and AXOS platform offer CSPs a compelling value proposition. Our portfolio provides CSPs the flexibility to upgrade their networks over time, reduce operational costs and maximize their return on capital expenditures. Our packet-based systems and nodes and AXOS platform enable CSPs to offer new services more quickly and generate new revenue opportunities. We believe the interoperability and compatibility of our portfolio reduces the complexity and cost of managing CSP networks.

Our Strategy
The Calix portfolio enables the delivery of basic voice and data and advanced broadband services across multiple protocols and form factors over fiber- and copper-based network architectures. Our objective is to leverage our portfolio to become the leading supplier of access systems and software that enable CSPs to transform their networks and business models to meet the changing demands of their subscribers. The principal elements of our strategy are:

• | Continue Our Sole Focus on Access Systems and Cloud Software — Our dedicated focus on access has been an important driver of our success with our customers. We believe our focus has allowed us to develop the highly innovative AXOS platform, our powerful operative system optimized for the access network, which allows us to develop access systems and solutions faster than our competitors. AXOS also allows our CSP customers to integrate, deploy, and upgrade our systems and solutions at an accelerated rate. This has proven to be a key differentiator for Calix. In contrast, virtually all of our large competitors in the access market devote some percentage of their resources to products outside of the access network, and in some cases, products not even designed for CSPs. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on the access market, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver compelling, timely and innovative access solutions to CSPs.


• | Continue to Enable our Customers to Transform Their Networks and Business Models — We believe that residential and business subscribers are pressuring CSPs to expand their offerings through the delivery of superior subscriber experiences. In response, CSPs need to transform their networks and business models by rapidly provisioning new services while minimizing the capital and operational costs of their networks. We believe the Calix portfolio enables CSPs to introduce new revenue-generating services as demanded by their subscribers.


• | Continue to Engage Directly with Customers — We operate a differentiated business model focused on aligning with our customers, predominantly through direct engagement, service, and support, complemented in most international markets by a high touch Fiber Forward Partner Program, a selective program for Calix Channel Partners that focuses on matching the access innovation of Calix with the local market leadership of our channel partners to drive new market opportunities, rapid results, and an improved bottom line. Our direct customer engagement model allows us to target our sales resources as well as align our

7

product development efforts closely to our customers' needs. Our direct engagement model is a key differentiator for our business and is critical to our continued market leadership.

• | Build on our Growing Customer Footprint — As of December 31, 2016, over 23 million ports of the Calix portfolio have been deployed at a growing number of CSPs worldwide. Our over 1,300 customers include many of the world's largest communications providers. This footprint provides us with the opportunity to sell additional components of the Calix portfolio to existing customers. For example, the vast majority of our existing customers have purchased additional line cards and other products from us after their initial purchase. We have also demonstrated that our footprint, combined with the flexibility of our portfolio, gives us incumbency benefits to sell complementary or new offerings in the future.


• | Expand Deliberately into New Market and Applications — We believe that a disciplined approach to targeting markets and applications is critical to our long-term success. For example, we initially focused on rural Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier ("ILEC") customers and have achieved an industry leadership position as the majority of U.S. Independent Operating Companies ("IOCs") have deployed our access systems and software. We will continue our disciplined approach of targeting new markets and applications in which we believe our products will rapidly gain customer adoption. For example, we are targeting additional markets for our fiber access solutions, including the mobile backhaul market, the municipal, open access, and electrical cooperative markets, and cable MSO markets. We have also entered new geographic markets, including Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and Latin America. These deployments complement our significant deployments in Canada and the Caribbean.


• | Pursue Strategic Relationships, Alliances and Acquisitions — We intend to continue to pursue strategic technology and distribution relationships, alliances and acquisitions that align us with CSPs' strategic directions to increase revenue-generating services while reducing the cost to deploy and operate their access networks. We believe these relationships, alliances and acquisitions will allow us to grow our footprint and enhance our ability to sell our access systems and cloud software. We developed and invested in the Calix Compatible Program to assure interoperability across the ecosystems of the majority of vendors critical for implementing and delivering new advanced broadband services. This program has approximately 61 technology members to date and enables our customers to rapidly deploy proven solutions in their access networks. We work with Ericsson Inc. ("Ericsson") and others to provide advanced broadband solutions globally, including efforts to ensure successful interoperation between our products and Ericsson's MediaFirst and Mediaroom IPTV platforms. In addition, our acquisitions of Optical Solutions, Inc. ("OSI") in 2006, Occam Networks, Inc. ("Occam") in 2011, and the fiber access assets from Ericsson in November 2012 have provided us with leading copper and fiber access technologies that have been integrated into the Calix portfolio.

Customers
We operate a differentiated customer engagement model that focuses on direct alignment with our customers through sales, service and support. In order to allocate our product development and sales efforts efficiently, we believe that it is critical to target markets, customers and applications deliberately. We have traditionally targeted CSPs, which own, build and upgrade their own access networks and which also value strong relationships with their access systems and software suppliers.
The U.S. ILEC market is composed of three distinct "tiers" of carriers, which we categorize based on their subscriber line counts and geographic coverage. Tier 1 CSPs are very large with wide geographic footprints. They have greater than ten million subscriber lines, and they generally correspond with the former Regional Bell Operating Companies. Tier 2 CSPs also operate typically within a wide geographic footprint, but are smaller in scale with subscriber line counts that range from approximately half a million to approximately seven million subscriber lines. Their service coverage areas are predominantly regional in scope and therefore they are often known as Regional Local Exchange Carriers ("RLECs"). Tier 3 CSPs consist primarily of over 1,000 predominantly local operators (often called IOCs) typically focused on a single community or a cluster of communities, although they also include a growing number of municipalities, electric cooperatives, fiber overbuilders, and wireless internet solutions providers. These entities range in size from a few hundred to approximately half a million subscriber lines.
To date, we have focused primarily on CSPs in the North American market. Our existing customers' networks serve over 100 million subscriber lines. In North America, our customers include CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink"), Frontier and Windstream. Our Tier 3 CSP customers have historically accounted for a large percentage of our sales. We also serve new entrants to the access services market who are building their own access networks, including cable MSOs and municipalities.
We have a few large customers who have represented a significant portion of our sales in any given period. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, CenturyLink accounted for 21%, 22%, and 23% of our revenue, respectively. In 2016, Windstream accounted for 15% of our revenue and less than 10% of our revenue in 2015 and 2014.
Some of our customers within the United States use or expect to use government-supported loan programs or grants to finance capital spending. Loans and grants through Rural Utility Service ("RUS"), which is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture, are used to promote the development of telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas.
Sales to customers outside the United States represented approximately 9%, 12%, and 12% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Historically, our sales outside the United States were predominantly to customers in the Caribbean, Canada and Europe.
Customer Engagement Model
We design, market and sell our access systems and software predominantly through our direct sales force, supported by marketing and product management personnel. We have expanded this model to include a small number of select channel partners in North America, 80 international channel partners who are part of our Fiber Forward Partner Program, and a global reseller relationship with Ericsson. Our sales 
8

effort is organized either by named accounts or regional responsibilities. Account teams comprise sales managers, supported by sales engineers and account managers, who work to target and sell to existing and prospective CSPs. The sales process includes analyzing CSPs' existing networks and identifying how they can utilize our products within their networks. We also offer advice regarding eligibility for, and support proposals to, appropriate sources of government funding. Even in circumstances where a channel partner is involved, our sales and marketing personnel are often selling side-by-side with the channel partner. We believe that our direct customer engagement approach provides us with significant differentiation in the customer sales process by aligning us more closely with our customers' changing needs.
As part of our sales process, CSPs will often perform a lab trial or a field trial of our access systems prior to full-scale commercial deployment. This is most common for CSPs purchasing a particular access system for the first time. Upon successful completion, the CSP generally accepts the lab and field trial equipment installed in its network and may continue with deployment of additional access systems. Our sales cycle, from initial contact with a CSP through the signing of a purchase agreement, may, in some cases, take several quarters.
Typically, our customer agreements contain general terms and conditions applicable to purchases of our access systems and cloud software. By entering into a customer agreement with us, a customer does not become obligated to order or purchase any fixed or minimum quantities of our access systems and software. Our customers generally order access systems and software from us by submitting purchase orders that describe, among other things, the type and quantities of our access systems and software that they desire to order, delivery and installation terms and other terms. Customers who have been awarded RUS loans or grants are required to contract under form contracts approved by RUS.
Our direct customer engagement model extends to service and support. Our service and support organization works closely with our customers to ensure the successful installation and ongoing support and consulting services for the Calix portfolio. Our service and support organization provides technical product support and consults with our customers to address their needs. More recently, we have ramped our services organization to offer our customers professional services associated with turnkey network upgrade projects that generally involve our services to design and implement network improvements over multiple sites using Calix equipment. We anticipate the market and customer demand for such services to increase as customers increasingly look to supply partners, such as Calix, to support such projects. We offer our customers a range of support offerings, including program management, training, installation, post-sales technical support, and marketing and network planning consulting services. As a part of our pre-sales effort, our engineers design the implementation of our products in our customers' access networks to meet our customers' performance and interoperability requirements. Although some of our reseller arrangements allow resellers to provide support, training, installation, and post-sales technical support, these resellers still rely heavily on us to provide support to the customer.
Our U.S.- and China-based technical support organization offers support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. With an active Calix Advantage agreement, customers receive a license to CMS, access to telephone support and online technical information, software product upgrades and maintenance releases, advance return materials authorization and on-site support, if necessary. Calix Advantage agreements are renewable on an annual basis. Most of our customers renew their Calix Advantage agreements. In addition, we offer extended warranty periods for our products in one- to five-year durations, which include the right to warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty period. The purchase of such extended warranties is initially recorded as deferred revenue. At the end of 2016, we had $23.6 million of deferred revenue associated with such extended warranties. For customers not under a Calix Advantage agreement or who have not purchased extended warranty services, product support and warranty services are provided for a fee on a per-incident basis. Outside North America, we typically cooperate with channel partners to provide local service and support to our end customers in those locations.
Platforms, Software and Systems
We develop, sell and support carrier-class hardware and cloud software products. The Calix portfolio enables CSPs to deliver both basic voice and data and advanced broadband services over legacy and next-generation access networks. The Calix portfolio consists of the following key features:

• | Broad Product Offering — We offer a comprehensive portfolio of access systems and cloud software that is deployed in the portion of the network that extends from the data center, central office, or similar facilities to a subscriber's premises. We sell our access systems and nodes in a variety of form factors, modular options and configurations that are important to CSPs. Our network-based products include our E-Series systems and nodes, which provide cost-effective, flexible service delivery of IP-based services, as well as our B-Series nodes, which provides multiservice over Ethernet via distributed nodes, and our C-Series system, which is our multiservice, multiprotocol access system. Our premises-based offerings consist of our P-Series ONTs and residential gateways as well as our GigaFamily of premises service delivery centers, hubs, and points which are deployed in combination with our E-Series, B-Series, and C-Series systems and nodes to enable our customers to connect to their subscribers across a diverse set of form factors, protocols and functionality requirements.


• | Multiservice and Multiprotocol — We develop our products and an extensive offering of service interfaces to ensure CSPs can connect to their subscribers to enable the delivery of basic voice and data or advanced broadband services over fiber- and copper-based network architectures regardless of protocol. Our C-Series system also enables CSPs to integrate IP and legacy protocols, as well as fiber- and copper-based connectivity, in a single chassis. In doing so, the C-Series system allows CSPs to evolve their access infrastructures over time. Our E-Series systems and nodes and B-Series nodes are multiservice but focus solely on Ethernet. Our E-Series systems and nodes are well suited for CSPs who are using Ethernet to transform their networks. Our B-Series nodes are focused on CSPs using Ethernet over copper and fiber and a distributed architecture to transform their networks. Our E-Series, B-Series, and C-Series systems and nodes are often, but are not required to be, deployed together so that the C-Series system can act as a protocol gateway for our E-Series and B-Series systems and nodes.

• | Powerful Operating Systems — Our access systems are interoperable and are designed to be easily deployed and managed together as a single, unified access network. The C7, E7 and most other E-Series nodes utilize a common Ethernet kernel, which we refer to as the Ethernet eXtensible Architecture ("EXA"), which was developed based on industry standard protocols and focused on the needs of the access network. Our AXOS platform, available on an expanding family of E-Series systems and nodes, has taken EXA to another level by allowing all software functions in the access network to be developed and run without dependence on the underlying hardware and associated silicon chipsets. Both environments allow Calix to develop, test and introduce new access systems and software rapidly, and enable our customers to deploy advanced broadband services at their desired pace.


• | Unified Network Management — Our CMS is server-based network management software capable of overseeing and managing multiple E-Series, B-Series, and C-Series networks. Activate is a cloud-based network management software optimized for AXOS systems. CMS and Activate perform all provisioning, maintenance and troubleshooting operations across disparate access technologies and networks through a common user interface. This enables CSPs to manage and unify the various elements of the Calix portfolio as a single, scalable platform. CMS and Activate are often integrated by our customers with their back-office systems for billing and provisioning.

The Calix portfolio allows CSPs to transform their legacy and mixed protocol access networks to fiber and Ethernet over time. CSPs often deploy our E-Series systems and nodes, B-Series nodes, and C-Series system together in data centers, central offices, or similar facilities to interconnect data centers and central offices. Our C-Series system can act as a protocol gateway when deployed with our E-Series and B-Series systems and nodes. Our E-Series and B-Series systems and nodes can be deployed either in data centers, central offices, remote network locations, existing cabinets or in customer premises locations depending upon the CSP's requirements. All of our E-Series, B-Series and C-Series systems and nodes interoperate with and can terminate network traffic from our P-Series ONTs. The GigaFamily of centers, hubs, and points only works with E-Series systems and nodes, with the exception of the 844E which is Ethernet-fed and can work with all Calix systems and nodes as well as those of other standards-based vendors.
A graphic representation of how the various components of the Calix portfolio work together as of the end of 2016 is shown in the network diagram below:
The graphic above depicts how a CSP might deploy the Calix portfolio in a CSP network. The network is divided into four segments: (1) the cloud, (2) the data center / central office, (3) the outside plant and (4) the premises. First, voice, video or data content is aggregated by a router in the cloud and transferred to an E9, E7, B6, or C7. The content is then sent around a redundant Ethernet transport ring, which operates using the 10 Gigabit Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet standard. The ring consists of a variety of Calix access systems or nodes, including E9s, E7s, E5s, E3s, B6s, and C7s, each of which may be located in a central office or in remote terminal locations closer to subscribers. Content can be pulled from any one of these locations and delivered either to a Calix system located at a remote node or directly to a subscriber premises. In the case where content is delivered to another Calix system, the content can be delivered over a variety of fiber-based technologies, such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet or multiple Gigabit Ethernet, or NxGE. Delivery to the subscriber premises over fiber or copper transmission lines is the final part of the access network. Delivery over fiber lines uses GPON, point-to-point Ethernet services, and delivery over copper lines uses DSL or G.fast services or telephone service. Both CMS and Activate manage all aspects of the Calix portfolio and supports features that allow remote management of equipment across the network, including equipment at the subscriber premises.

Access eXtensible Operating System (AXOS)
AXOS, or Access eXtensible Operating System, is a Linux-based network operating system and software platform built for the specific needs of the access network. Completely hardware independent, AXOS allows for all software functions in the access network to be developed and run without dependence on the underlying hardware and associated silicon chipsets. With an always-on architecture and consistent provisioning services, AXOS is designed to accelerate time-to-revenue, eliminate service disruptions, and reduce operational complexity for service providers. Introduced in 2015, AXOS is currently implemented in the E9-2, E3-2, E3-16F, E5-16F, and E5 business systems and is expected to expand in the future to other E3, E5, E7, and E9 systems and nodes. Within AXOS, containerized software components ride on top of a unique hardware abstraction layer that preserves software independence from the underlying hardware. All components and operational functions within AXOS use standard NETCONF protocol and YANG data models that enable AXOS powered systems to fit into any open SDN orchestration and control framework. Open, published APIs also allow customers to directly program unique network applications and services.
The following graphic depicts the components and operational functions of AXOS:
Compass Cloud
Compass Cloud is an expanding family of software-as-a-service products that enables CSPs to accelerate their business transformation. Each Compass Cloud product is designed to directly affect key business and market roles within CSPs, and can help them increase revenue, improve customer satisfaction, optimize network resources, and reduce the cost of delivering services. Compass Cloud products are offered using a software-as-a-service ("SaaS") model based on a low monthly service fee and no upfront hardware or licensing fees. The products are hosted in a cloud-based data center, alleviating CSPs' need to deploy, operate, or maintain physical hardware for Compass services, and are accessed through our Command Center subscriber interface.
Flow Analyze Plus offers a tool that provides an in-depth view of the traffic in CSP networks on a real-time basis. This view of traffic is non-intrusive and can be focused on a per-service, per-subscriber, per-location, and per-interface basis - both in real time and as a historical report. As a result, service providers can see what actually happened when a problem occurs in their network at any time. By monitoring subscriber usage data, as well as tracking universal subscriber identification mapping, Flow Analyze Plus provides a low-cost solution for generating monthly usage billing reports and diagnosing subscriber complaints.
Consumer Connect Plus enables service providers to remotely activate new broadband devices and manage home networks, creating new revenue sources, improved customer satisfaction, and reduced service delivery costs. Consumer Connect provides TR-069 ACS device management via a cloud-based SaaS solution hosted by Calix and offers such features as auto-discovery of intelligent devices within the home, auto-support of new TR-069 devices, bulk gateway maintenance, and DHCP server functionality as well as the ability to push service profiles to gateways. Consumer Connect Plus also shares a common customer ID with Flow Analyze Plus, allowing the applications to work closely together. Consumer Connect Plus can also provide remote customer LAN diagnostics as well as LAN visibility to help track consumer electronics trends.

Service Verify gives service providers the tools to comprehensively validate quality of service commitments for their business subscribers. Service Verify automates collection and analysis of key performance metrics from intelligent Ethernet access devices, and provides custom, real-time reporting that can be analyzed internally or shared externally with demanding business customers. Predictive analytics help identify performance issues before service level agreements are jeopardized.
Complementary to Compass Cloud, Open Link Cable is a software product that enables cable operators to deliver gigabit services over Calix E3-2, E7-2 and E7-20 GPON optical line terminals (OLTs) and Calix ONUs/ONTs/GigaFamily while continuing to use traditional back office and DOCSIS command and control procedures. In addition, Open Link Cable is designed to support the CableLabs DPoG 1.0 standards in order to accelerate deployments without changing operational procedures and systems.
Access Analyze is a Compass software product that enables CSPs to point their CMS server at the cloud and correlate their access data across Compass Cloud products. It also provides cloud back-up for CMS data. Access Analyze enables reporting across network, subscriber, and application data, including in-home Wi-Fi device data and CSP backoffice systems information like customer billing and service offering data.
Our CMS server-based network management software system and Activate cloud-based element management for AXOS systems enable CSPs to remotely manage their access networks and scale bandwidth capacity to support advanced broadband services and video. Our CMS and Activate systems are capable of overseeing and managing multiple standalone networks and perform all provisioning, maintenance and troubleshooting operations for these networks across our E-Series, B-Series and C-Series systems and nodes. Additionally, our CMS and Activate systems are designed to scale from small networks to large, geographically dispersed networks consisting of hundreds or even thousands of our access systems. CMS and Activate provide an enhanced graphical user interface and delivers a detailed view and interactive control of various management functions, such as access control lists, alarm reporting and security. For very large CSPs, our CMS and Activate systems can be used in conjunction with operational support systems to manage large, global networks with tens of millions of subscribers. Our CMS and Activate systems are scalable to support large and small networks and enables integration into the other management systems of our customers.
We offer CSPs a graphical user interface-based management system for provisioning and troubleshooting service, and the capacity for bulk provisioning and reporting for thousands of elements simultaneously. Both CMS and Activate also have open application programming interfaces that allow third-party software developers to extend our functionality to include home provisioning, remote troubleshooting and applications monitoring and management.
Calix E-Series Access Systems and Nodes
Our E-Series access systems and access nodes consist of chassis-based systems as well as fixed form factor nodes that are designed to support an array of advanced IP-based services offered by CSPs. Our E-Series systems and nodes are designed to be carrier-class and enable CSPs to implement advanced Ethernet transport and aggregation, as well as voice, data and video services over both fiber- and copper-based network architectures. Many of our E-Series systems and nodes are environmentally hardened and can be deployed in a variety of network locations, including data centers, central offices, remote terminals, video headends and co-location facilities. In addition, due to the small size of many of our E-Series systems and nodes, most can be installed in confined locations such as remote nodes and multi-dwelling units. As such, many of our E-Series systems and nodes can be deployed in most competitor and other third-party cabinets or as stand-alone sealed nodes in our access network. The majority of our E-Series systems and nodes are managed using Activate and can be deployed in conjunction with our B-Series nodes, C-Series system, P-Series and GigaFamily premises products. We believe the deployment flexibility and Ethernet focus of our E-Series systems and nodes make them well suited for CSPs extending Ethernet services and fiber closer to the subscriber premises.

The following pictures depict the E-Series systems and nodes:
Our AXOS E9-2 Intelligent Edge System is a revolutionary, non-blocking, high-density NG-PON2 services modular chassis that enables service providers to move to a converged services network. The disruptive architecture of the E9-2 extends the access edge and delivers a dramatic reduction in total cost of ownership for service providers by collapsing access, aggregation, and service edge functions, including routing and subscriber management, into a single system. Our E7 has two form factors. Our E7-2 is a one rack unit chassis with two line card slots, while the E7-20 is a 13 rack unit chassis with two common control card slots and 20 service line card slots. Our E7s deliver Ethernet services over copper and fiber, including a wide range of GPON, point-to-point Gigabit Ethernet, VDSL2 with vectoring support, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet and NG-PON2 services. Our AXOS E3-2 Intelligent PON Node is a revolutionary design that disrupts access and edge architecture by integrating with legacy networks while collapsing access and service edge functions in a distributed fiber architecture. Its modular design provides a typically easy upgrade path to any next generation 10G PON technology while leveraging existing fiber deep designs, management systems, power, and rights-of-way. Our other E-Series nodes include the fixed form factor E5-48, E5-48C, E5-16F, E5-300, and E5-500 node families, as well as the E3-12C, E3-48, E3-48C, and E3-16F sealed access nodes, which collectively deliver high-speed broadband with interfaces that range from 10 Gigabit Ethernet transport and aggregation to ADSL2+, VDSL2 with vectoring support, G.fast , GPONm XGS-PON, NG-PON2, and point-to-point Gigabit Ethernet, as well as Carrier Ethernet 2.0 business services.
Key technology differentiators of the E-Series systems and nodes are:

• | Standards-Based Switching Architecture — Most of our E-Series systems and nodes currently utilize EXA, however, an expanding family of our E-Series systems and nodes leverage the AXOS platform, our Linux-based network operating system and software platform built for the specific needs of the access network. Completely hardware independent, AXOS allows for all software functions in the access network to be developed and run without dependence on the underlying hardware and associated silicon chipsets. With its always-on architecture and consistent provisioning services, AXOS accelerates time-to-revenue, eliminates service disruptions, and reduces operational complexity for service providers. All future E-Series systems will be based on this open, standards-based, SDN-aligned platform.


• | Multiservice over Ethernet — Our E-Series systems and nodes enable CSPs to offer high bandwidth, advanced broadband and low latency services across Ethernet over fiber- and copper-based network architectures.


• | Deployment Flexibility — Our E-Series systems and nodes are composed of a variety of distinct small form factor configurations as little as a single rack unit in height to a 13-rack unit large chassis. The E-Series systems and nodes are designed to deliver operational efficiencies without sacrificing deployment flexibility or service functionality. Our E-Series systems are optimally sized to deliver high bandwidth services from a data center, central office, remote terminal, remote node or MDU. For CSPs seeking additional flexibility and performance, the modular E7-2 and E9-2 and the high capacity E7-20 can be combined with other E7s or other B-Series, C-Series and E-Series systems and nodes and managed uniformly.

13


• | High Capacity and Reliability — Our E-Series systems and nodes have high data throughput capacity and are designed to meet the demanding bandwidth and low latency requirements of advanced broadband services for residential and business subscribers. Our E-Series systems and nodes support a range of transport options from multiple 100 Gigabit Ethernet uplinks in each E9-2 chassis down to redundant Gigabit Ethernet in the E5-48 node family. Our E9-2 was architected to be the industry's first fully distributed and non-blocking system. Our chassis-based E7-2 supports a redundant 100 gigabits per second backplane in each deployable module with line cards that further support a minimum of 100 gigabits per second switching capacity. The E7-20 supports the same 100 gigabits per second line card switching capacity per card, but houses each card in a 20-service line card slot chassis with a two terabits per second backplane. The E7 also supports transparent local area network services and are designed to be Metro Ethernet Forum compliant and to meet NEBS requirements.


• | Broad Array of Advanced Services Support — Our E-Series systems and nodes support a broad array of advanced services. Our E3-12C supports up to 12 VDSL2 combination voice and DSL services ports as well as DSL port bonding, and offers multiple Gigabit Ethernet network uplinks. Our E3-48, E3-48C, E5-48, and E5-48C support up to 48 VDSL2 service ports as well as DSL port bonding and vectoring, and offer multiple 10 Gigabit Ethernet and 2.5 or single Gigabit Ethernet uplinks. Our E7s, E5-300s, and E5-520 support a mix of GPON, multiple Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports, and well as select Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) advanced business services. Our E9-2 supports both NG-PON2 and XGS-PON while the E3-2 supports NG-PON2, XGS-PON, and GPON. E7 line card options include a mix of GPON, point-to-point Gigabit Ethernet, 10 Gigabit Ethernet services, and in the case of the E7-2, 48 ports of VDSL2 combo and vectoring services on a line card, which translates into an industry-leading 96 VDSL2 combo ports in a 1 rack unit form factor, as well as traffic management and queuing, performance monitoring and virtual local area network stacking to support quality of service.

Calix GigaFamily, P-Series Optical Network Terminals and Residential Gateways
Our GigaFamily, P-Series ONTs, and residential gateways consist of a broad range of customer premises solutions, including standards-based GigaCenters, GigaHubs, GigaPoints, ONTs, and residential gateways for residential and business use in conjunction with our E-Series, B-Series and C-Series systems. GigaCenter premises service delivery platforms combine the ability to support a gigabit experience and host advanced applications with Carrier Class Wi-Fi - a wireless technology that enables extraordinary coverage and capacity through the use of the 802.11ac protocol, a 4x4 multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO) antenna array, and beamforming technology. GigaHubs are multi-port service demarcation hubs and serve as fully integrated GPON broadband access and service delivery solutions. GigaPoint single port broadband demarcation points deliver gigabit services to subscribers, are simple to activate and manage, and are sometimes deployed in conjunction with subtended residential gateways as well as 844E GigaCenters. The GigaFamily of centers, hubs, and points are designed to be deployed in conjunction with the powerful Compass software application suite to provide meaningful insights into subscriber usage trends and quality of services. Our portfolio of ONTs, residential gateways, and GigaFamily centers, hubs, and points is designed to support advanced broadband services, such as IPTV, RF video, business services and mobile backhaul (including Ethernet OAM support for conformance with service level agreements). The design and flexibility of the P-Series and GigaFamily portfolio allows CSPs to lower initial capital expenditures as well as reduce operational costs. Our P-Series ONTs and residential gateways can auto-detect the bandwidth of the network and enable CSPs to change line rates and features without expensive truck rolls or hardware replacements. To meet the deployment and service requirement needs of CSPs, we offer a growing number of ONT, residential gateway, and GigaFamily models available in a variety of form factors tailored to multiple deployment scenarios, including single homes, MDUs, businesses and cellular towers as illustrated below:
14

Calix B-Series Access Nodes
Our B-Series access nodes consist of chassis-based nodes that are designed to support an array of advanced IP-based services offered by CSPs. Our B-Series nodes are designed to be carrier-class and enable CSPs to implement advanced Ethernet transport and aggregation, as well as voice, data and video services over both fiber- and copper-based network architectures. Our B-Series nodes are environmentally hardened and can be deployed in a variety of network locations, including data centers, central offices, remote terminals, video headends and co-location facilities. In addition, due to the small size of some of our B-Series nodes, many can be installed in confined locations such as remote nodes and multi-dwelling units. As such, many of our B-Series nodes can be deployed in most competitor and other third-party cabinets or as stand-alone sealed nodes in our access network. Our B-Series nodes are managed using our CMS and can be deployed in conjunction with our E-Series and C-Series systems as well as our P-Series ONTs. We believe the deployment flexibility and Ethernet focus of our B-Series nodes make them well suited for CSPs extending Ethernet services and fiber closer to the subscriber premises.
Our B6 has three form factors. Our B6-001 is a 1 rack unit chassis with one line card slot, whereas the B6-006 is a 7 rack unit chassis with six line card slots and the B6-012 is a 12 rack unit chassis with 20 line card slots. Our B6s deliver Ethernet services over fiber, including a wide range of GPON, point-to-point Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet services.
Key technology differentiators of the B-Series nodes are:

• | Multiservice over Ethernet — Our B-Series nodes enable CSPs to offer high bandwidth, advanced broadband and low latency services across Ethernet over fiber- and copper-based network architectures.


• | Deployment Flexibility — Our B-Series nodes are composed of three distinct form factor chassis between 1 and 12 rack units in height. The B-Series nodes are designed to deliver operational efficiencies without sacrificing deployment flexibility or service functionality. Our B-Series node options are optimally sized to deliver high bandwidth services from a data center, central office, remote terminal, remote node or MDU. For CSPs seeking additional flexibility and performance, the B6s can be combined with C-Series and E-Series systems and nodes, all of which are managed by our CMS.


• | High Capacity and Reliability — Our B-Series nodes have high data throughput capacity and are designed to meet the demanding bandwidth and low latency requirements of advanced broadband services for residential and business subscribers. Our B-Series nodes support a range of transport options from multiple 10 Gigabit Ethernet uplinks in each chassis down to redundant Gigabit Ethernet ports. The distributed intelligence of the B6s supports 10 gigabits per second in each deployed line card. The B6s also support T1 circuit emulation and are designed to be Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF 9 and MEF 14) compliant and to meet Network Equipment-Building System ("NEBS") requirements.


• | Broad Array of Advanced Services Support — Our B-Series nodes support a broad array of advanced services, including up to 48 VDSL2 and 48 ADSL2+ overlay or combination voice and DSL services ports as well as DSL port bonding on each line card, and offer multiple Gigabit Ethernet network uplinks. Our B6s also support a mix of GPON, point-to-point gigabit Ethernet and multiple Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. Line card options include a mix of GPON, point-to-point gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet services, as well as traffic management and queuing, performance monitoring, and virtual local area network stacking to support quality of service.

Calix C-Series Multiservice Access System
Our C7 multiservice access system is designed to support a wide array of basic voice and data services offered by CSPs while also supporting advanced, high-speed, packet-based services such as Gigabit Ethernet, GPON, DSL (including very high-speed digital subscriber line 2 ("VDSL2") and asymmetrical digital subscriber line 2+ ("ADSL2+")) and advanced applications like IPTV. In so doing, our C-Series system facilitates network transformation by integrating the functions required to transport and deliver voice, data and video services over both fiber- and copper-based network architectures. Our C-Series system is a chassis-based product with 23 line card slots, three of which are used for common logic, switching fabric and uplinks, with the remaining 20 slots available for any service interface card we offer. Our C-Series system is managed using our CMS. Our high-capacity C-Series system is flexible and is designed to be deployed in a variety of locations, including data centers, central offices, remote terminals, video headends and co-location facilities. Our C-Series system leverages a common operating system kernel, the EXA, that it shares with many of our E-Series systems and nodes, allowing for common provisioning and facilitated platform interoperability. The multiprotocol and integrated transport capabilities of our C-Series system allow it to be deployed as an aggregation or gateway device for our E-Series and B-Series systems and nodes, and P-Series ONTs.
Key technology differentiators of the C-Series system are:

• | Protocol Independent — Our C-Series system enables the integration of multiple protocols through a system architecture where line cards perform specific protocol processing.


• | High Capacity — Our C-Series system can enable up to 200 gigabits per second total throughput capacity. It can provide service delivery speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second in network transport rings or directly to subscribers, which is significantly greater than the bandwidth that CSPs are typically providing to their subscribers. This enables CSPs to scale their advanced broadband service offerings over time without the need to change their equipment.


• | Flexible Switching Architecture — Our C-Series system supports a highly scalable switching architecture with characteristics similar to high performance routers. All services are converted to packets on line cards allowing our system to natively switch circuits, cells and packets. As a result, both legacy and advanced packet-based services can be supported simultaneously or uniformly, allowing the C-Series to be deployed as a pure Ethernet delivery system, a traditional service delivery system or a hybrid services system.

15


• | Density — In typical applications, a single 14-inch high C-Series system shelf can terminate 480 copper-based subscriber connections, or up to 5,120 fiber-to-the premises, or FTTP, subscribers using GPON. This functionality allows up to 2,400 subscribers of advanced broadband services over copper-based networks or over 25,000 subscribers over fiber-based networks to be served out of a single seven-foot rack in the central office.


• | Reduced Risk of Technological Obsolescence — As new services and technologies are introduced to the network, our flexible C-Series architecture allows CSPs to add or swap line cards to introduce new functionality into the access system. Services such as IPTV and voice over Internet protocol require new features like Internet Group Management Protocol channel change processing and protocol gateway support, which can easily be added without substantial changes to existing equipment. As a result, equipment purchased by CSPs can have longer useful lives, which can reduce CSPs' capital expenditures.


• | Extensive Line Card Offering — Currently our C-Series system offers 47 line cards that enable a diverse set of trunk and subscriber interfaces, ranging from basic voice service and specialized circuits to advanced broadband services such as packet-based Fast and gigabit Ethernet, SONET (up to optical carrier-48, or OC-48), VDSL2 and ADSL2+ across multiple copper pairs and GPON. In addition, our C-Series system supports multiple combinations of service interface cards in any slot at any time. We believe this flexibility provides CSPs the ability to evolve networks toward higher-capacity, packet-based service offerings in a minimally disruptive and cost-effective manner.

Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. Our research and development team is composed of engineers with expertise in hardware, software and optics. Our team of engineers is located in our Petaluma, San Jose and Santa Barbara facilities located in California; our Minneapolis, Minnesota facility; our Acton, Massachusetts facility and our Nanjing, China facility. We also outsource a portion of our software development to domestic and international third parties. Our research and development team is responsible for designing, developing and enhancing our hardware and software platforms, performing product and quality assurance testing and ensuring the compatibility of our products with third-party hardware and software products. We have made significant investments in the Calix portfolio. We intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development and to develop new product capabilities and invest in innovative technologies to support the performance, scalability and management of the Calix portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our research and development expenses totaled $106.9 million, $89.7 million, and $80.3 million, respectively.
Manufacturing
We work closely with third parties to manufacture and deliver our products. Our manufacturing organization consists primarily of supply chain managers, new product introduction personnel and test engineers. We outsource our manufacturing and order fulfillment and tightly integrate our supply chain management and new product introduction activities. Although we have multiple contract manufacturing arrangements, we primarily utilize Flex Ltd, formerly Flextronics International Ltd ("Flex"), as our contract manufacturer. Our relationship with Flex allows us to conserve working capital, reduce product costs and minimize delivery lead times while maintaining high product quality. Generally, new product introduction occurs in Flex's facilities in Suzhou, China. Once product manufacturing quality and yields reach a satisfactory level, volume production and testing of circuit board assemblies also occur in Suzhou, China. Final system and cabinet assembly and testing are performed in Flex's facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico. Order fulfillment is performed by Pegasus Logistics Group, Inc. in Texas. We also evaluate and utilize other vendors for various portions of our supply chain from time to time, including order fulfillment of our circuit boards. This model allows us to operate with lower inventory levels while maintaining the ability to scale quickly to handle increased order volume.
Product reliability is essential for our customers, who place a premium on continuity of service for their subscribers. We perform rigorous in-house quality control testing to help ensure the reliability of our systems. Our internal manufacturing organization designs, develops and implements complex test processes to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products.
The manufacturing of our products by contract manufacturers is a complex process and involves certain risks, including the potential absence of adequate capacity, the unavailability of or interruptions in access to certain process technologies, and the reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, quality and costs. As such, we may experience production problems or manufacturing delays in the future. Additionally, shortages in components that we use in our systems are possible and our ability to predict the availability of such components, some sourced from a single or limited source of supply, may be limited. Our systems include some components that are proprietary in nature and only available from a single source, as well as some components that are generally available from a number of suppliers. The lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in product specifications or delivery schedules. In some cases, significant time would be required to establish relationships with alternate suppliers or providers of proprietary components. We generally do not have long-term contracts with component providers that guarantee the supply of components or their manufacturing services. If we experience any difficulties in managing relationships with our contract manufacturers, or any interruption in our own operations or our contract manufacturers operations or if a supplier is unable to meet our needs, we may encounter manufacturing delays that could impede our ability to meet our customers' requirements and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to deliver products in a timely manner to our customers would be adversely impacted materially if we needed to qualify replacements for any of the components used in our systems.
Seasonality
Fluctuations in our revenue occur due to many factors, including the varying budget cycles and seasonal buying patterns of our customers. More specifically, our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual budgets, and in certain regions, customers are also challenged by winter weather conditions that inhibit fiber deployment in outside plants.
16

Intellectual Property
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections. In addition, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information. This protection is accomplished through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and through a combination of U.S. and international intellectual property laws.
As of December 31, 2016, we held 111 U.S. patents and had 25 pending U.S. patent applications. One of the U.S. patents is also covered by granted international patents in three countries. As of December 31, 2016, we had no pending international patent applications. U.S. patents generally have a term of twenty years from filing. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. Information pertaining to our patents such as filing dates and terms is available free-of-charge at the United States Patent and Trademark Office website at www.uspto.gov.
We rely on intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. U.S. patent, copyright and trade secret laws afford us only limited protection, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and the issued patents may not be enforceable. Any infringement of proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in competitors offering similar products, resulting in the loss of our competitive advantage and decreased sales.
We believe that the frequency of assertions of patent infringement continues to increase in our industry. In particular, patent holders, including entities and organizations that purchase or hold patents to monetize such rights, assert patent infringement claims as a competitive tactic as well as a source of revenue. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims and could distract our management from operating our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.
Competition
The communications access equipment market is highly competitive. Competition in this market is based on any one or a combination of the following factors:

• | price;


• | functionality;


• | existing business and customer relationships;


• | the ability of products and services, including turnkey professional services capabilities, to meet customers' immediate and future network requirements;


• | product quality;


• | installation capability;


• | service and support;


• | scalability; and


• | manufacturing capability.

We compete with a number of companies within markets that we serve, and we anticipate that competition will intensify. ADTRAN, Inc. enjoys strong supplier relationships with the largest U.S. ILECs and has a broad international business. Other established suppliers with which we compete include Alcatel-Lucent S.A., which was acquired by Nokia Corporation in January 2016; Arris Group, Inc.; Ciena Corporation; Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.; and ZTE Corporation. There are also a number of smaller companies with which we compete in various geographic or vertical markets, including DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. While most of these smaller competitors lack broad national scale and product portfolios, they can offer strong competition on a deal-by-deal basis. As we expand into adjacent markets, we expect to encounter new competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, manufacturing capacity and technical, financial and marketing resources as well as better established relationships with CSPs than we do. Many of our competitors have greater resources to develop products or pursue acquisitions and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for their products and technologies. In addition, a number of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at below market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively.
Government Funding Initiatives
Many of our customers fund deployment of and improvements to telecommunications network infrastructure using government funds. In the United States, CSPs are required under the Federal Communications Commission's rules to contribute a percentage of their revenues to the federal Universal Service Fund. In early October 2011, the then-chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") outlined a plan to transform the Universal Service Fund, an $8 billion fund that is paid for by the nation's telephone customers and used to subsidize basic telephone service in rural areas, into one that will help expand broadband Internet service to 18 million Americans who lack high-speed access. These funds, now governed by a new set of rules called the Connect America Fund, or CAF, are distributed as subsidies to CSPs serving rural subscribers that are expensive to reach as well as to low-income consumers, schools, libraries, and rural health care

facilities. As of the end of 2016, the FCC continued to finalize the rules for the annual $3.8 billion in CAF distributions targeted at broadband deployment in underserved and unserved parts of the U.S. RUS administers funds through a separate U.S. government initiative to promote the development of telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas through loans, loan guarantees and grants. Some of our U.S. customers have been awarded RUS loans and/or have received subsidies from CAF programs, and we have provided the network equipment for such projects.
