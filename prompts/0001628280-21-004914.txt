We offer complete application training to our customers’ in-store staff and provide technical training to our customers’ information systems personnel. We provide customers with installation, technical and life-cycle support for our products through support services, license and/or subscription agreements. We also offer depot repair and overnight—Advanced Exchange—services from our offices in San Diego, California, Mississauga, Ontario, and our corporate headquarters in New Hartford, New York. In North America, we offer 24-hour help desk support from our diagnostic service centers located in New Hartford, New York and Tampa, Florida, and on-site support through our field tech service network, which services the continental United States. Outside of the continental U.S., we similarly support our products by providing call center, installation, on-site, and/or depot repair services to our customers 
depending upon a customer’s geographic location. These services are delivered to our customers directly by us and by authorized third parties.
We believe our software, hardware and integrated solutions uniquely position us to be a leader in assisting customers to innovate and improve their in-store operations in a rapidly changing and challenging market, particularly in light of the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry. Our continued success and growth will depend upon our ability to advance and create new technology, products and services to meet customer demands, as well as deploy capital and resources that uniquely deliver customer value. This includes the development and introduction of new products and services, targeted acquisitions and a constant review of internal spend.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
In the U.S., we market and sell our products through our dedicated sales teams and channel partners, which directly interface with our tier 1 customers (owner and/or operator of 2,000 or more sites), tier 2 customers (owner and/or operator of 500-2,000 sites), tier 3 customers (owner and/or operator of 5-500 sites) and tier 4 customers (owner and/or operator of 1-4 sites). Our international direct sales teams and channel partners market and sell our products and services to tier 1 customers outside of the U.S., as well as local/regional customers from in-country offices.
Our products are also offered and sold through sales representatives, who enlist and support well-regarded value-added resellers serving multi-unit operators, the independent restaurant category, and the non-food service markets such as retail and convenience stores, amusement parks, movie theaters, cruise lines, spas, and other ticketing and entertainment venues.
PAR has developed and nurtured long-term relationships with several of the largest brands in the Restaurant/Retail segment, including McDonald’s Corporation and Yum! Brands, Inc. PAR has been an approved provider of restaurant technology systems and related support services to McDonald’s and their franchisees since 1980, and an approved supplier to Yum! Brands since 1983. Other significant restaurant chains that use PAR POS products and related services include Dairy Queen, Arby's, the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. units of CKE Restaurants, Inc., and franchisees of these organizations.
Competition
Our software and hardware product offerings face stiff competition in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving restaurant and retail markets. Most of our significant customers have several approved suppliers of software and/or hardware similar to one or more of our products. We compete in these markets directly with product offerings from Oracle Corporation, NCR Corporation and others. We compete on the basis of product delivery (cloud versus traditional on-premise software applications), existing and planned product design, features and functionality, software application and integration capabilities, quality and reliability, product development capabilities, price, and customer service. Our competitive advantages include our open solutions offerings, including our cloud-based software (SaaS delivery model), on-premise software, ergonomic purpose-built hardware, advanced development capabilities, extensive domain knowledge and expertise, excellent product reliability, a customer-dedicated direct sales force organization, and world class responsive customer service and support. As relevant technologies evolve and customer demands and expectations increase, so do the competitive pressures in the market, with new companies entering and existing companies expanding their product and service portfolios. We expect competition in the restaurant market to continue to increase, including competition from both cloud and traditional on-premise POS software, back-office software, hardware providers and other business software and solution providers. With many of our product and service offerings, we face competition from companies who have access to significantly more financial and technical resources than we possess. 
Research and Development
Continuous product research, innovation, and product development are an integral part of our business. We continuously evaluate customer needs and new technologies to enable us to develop innovative and relevant products, in addition to creating enhancements to our existing products that improve and/or add to their functionality, performance, operation, and integration capabilities—from leveraging the latest innovations in cloud computing to wireless headsets and other devices to advances in internet performance. Research and development expenses were $19.3 million , $13.4 million, and $12.4 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We assemble our ES 8000 series platforms internally in the U.S. We source other hardware products and related materials, product assemblies, and components from third parties. Although we purchase most of the materials, product sub-assemblies and full assemblies from several suppliers, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our assembly components and hardware products. As a result, we periodically review and evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations in the 
event one or more of our suppliers should fail to perform. See “Risk Factors” for a discussion on risks related to our supply chain operations. 
Government Segment
PAR’s Government segment provides technical expertise in contract development of advanced systems and software solutions for the DoD and other Federal agencies, as well as satellite, communication and IT mission systems support at a number of U.S. Government facilities both in the U.S. and worldwide. The Government segment is focused on two principal offerings, intelligence solutions and mission systems contract support, with additional revenue from a small number of licensed software products for use in analytic and operational environments that leverage geospatial intelligence data. 
Intelligence Solutions
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (“ISR”). We provide a variety of intelligence analysis, systems integration, and situational awareness solutions for mobile and data center offerings. Our substantive, in-depth expertise in these domains enables us to provide our government customers and large systems integrators with key technologies to support a variety of applications ranging from strategic enterprise systems to tactical in-the-field dismounted users. Additionally, we have developed a number of solutions relative to these advanced technologies and we provide integration and training support with respect to these solutions. ISR provides systems engineering support and software-based solutions to the DoD research and development laboratories, intelligence customers, and operational commands. Our internal expertise ranges from theoretical and experimental studies to development and fielding of operational capabilities. Our employees are:
•experienced developers and subject-matter experts in the DoD full motion video;

Satellite and Telecommunications Support. We provide a wide range of technical and support services to sustain mission critical components of the Department of Defense Information Network (“DoDIN”). These services include continuous 24/7/365 satellite and teleport facility operations and maintenance, engineering and installation services including inside and outside plant services, and maintenance of infrastructure and information systems for very low frequency, low frequency, high frequency, very high frequency and ground-based radio transmitter/receiver facilities, including high tower antennas up to 1200 feet. We operate and maintain satellite communications and teleport facilities with ultra-high frequency, super high frequency and extremely high frequency satellite communication earth terminals, and support telecommunications architectures such as fixed submarine broadcast systems and high-frequency global communications systems. The DoD communications earth stations operated by PAR Government are the primary communications systems utilized by the national command authority and military services to exercise command and control of the nation’s air, land, and naval forces and to provide support to allied coalition forces.
Space and Satellite Support Services. We support globally-deployed operational forces by providing reliable 24/7/365 support services for a variety of DoD satellite communication systems. We provide satellite control center operations and mission planning for DoD Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance operations. 
We provide satellite ground system support, including operations and maintenance, sustainment, upgrades, communications security management, anomaly response/resolution, process improvement, emergency response and disaster recovery. Our experience also includes mission planning and operations training.
Information Systems Support. We provide comprehensive, dependable, and secure information systems support services to the DoD and other federal agencies. These services include information technology infrastructure library based, tier 0 to 3 service desk operations for thousands of enterprise users, network system administration, database administration, information assurance/system security, information security training, and SIPRNet and NIPRNet management. We also perform maintenance, auditing, monitoring, upgrades, planning, testing, and integration and configuration services, to include security systems including intrusion detection systems.
The mission systems group supports critical information systems which operate elements of the DoDIN to support the National Command Authority (President and Joint Chiefs of Staff), DoD, and other government agencies. Our system troubleshooting and regulatory experts support the customer mission around the globe. Approximately 60% of our footprint is outside the continental U.S. with contracts in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Australia, and U.S. commonwealths and territories in the Pacific and Caribbean.
PAR Government has strong and enduring relationships with a diverse set of customers throughout the U.S. DoD and Federal government. Our track record of delivering mission critical services to government customers spans decades, and includes contracts continuing 20 years or more, with an average contract duration of three to five years. We work closely with our customers, with many of our mission system employees co-located at customer sites. Our strong relationships and on-site presence with our customers enables PAR Government to develop substantive customer and technical domain knowledge, translate mission understanding into exemplary program execution, and create continued demand for PAR Government’s services.
Products Division
PAR Government’s software product business draws on decades of research and development (“R&D”), image processing and geospatial information system (“GIS”) experience. Licensable products focus on serving analysts and operators who seek highly accurate and timely information with both temporal and geospatial context. Product utility spans the modern battlefield from rear echelon analyst cell to the field Operations Center to the mobile devices and displays carried by infantryman at the very forward edge of a battlespace. Currently we offer two types of software products. The geospatial visualization (“GV”) image processing suite is used by the international defense and intelligence community to analyze still and video imagery. A second product line provides situational awareness solutions used by government and private organizations to manage rapid response teams or deployed field units. Customers include global geospatial software providers, NATO partners, public safety organizations, and the U.S. senior intelligence agencies.
Marketing and Competition
We obtain contracts through a mix of competitive proposals and technical paper submissions in response to solicitations from government organizations and prime contractors. In addition, PAR Government often obtains contracts by submitting unsolicited proposals against publicly identified government requirements which can then be selected on merit for further development and funding. Although well positioned in our business areas, competition for government contracts is intense. Many of our competitors are large corporations that have substantially greater financial resources and broader capabilities in management technology. Within our intel solutions portfolio we compete based on the technical talent and accomplishments of our development staff, software support and program management teams who have earned a reputation for rapid solutioning, leading edge software solutions and technical talent with high security clearance and the background and appetite to tackle truly difficult problems. In our mission systems contract portfolio, we also compete with many smaller, economically disadvantaged companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential “set aside” treatment that target segments of the government contract market. Here the principal competitive factors are past performance, the ability to perform the statement of work, price, technological capabilities, management capabilities, and service. Many of our DoD customers are migrating to price sensitive, best value procurements while leveraging commercial software standards, applications, and solutions.
Our strategy is to build upon our Government segment's sustained performance on existing service contracts, coupled with investments in enhanced business development capabilities. We believe we are well positioned to realize continued renewals of expiring contracts and extensions of existing contracts, and to secure service and solution contracts in expanded areas within the U.S. DoD and other Federal agencies. We believe our highly relevant technical competencies, intellectual property, and investments in new technologies provide opportunities to offer systems integration, products, and highly-specialized service solutions to the U.S. DoD and other Federal agencies. The general uncertainty in U.S. defense total workforce policies 
(military, civilian, and contract), procurement cycles, and spending levels for the next several years are factors we monitor as we develop and implement our business strategy for our Government segment.
Backlog
The value of existing PAR Government contracts at December 31, 2020, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $150.5 million, of which $27.8 million was funded. The value of existing PAR Government contracts at December 31, 2019, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $148.7 million, of which $32.8 million was funded. Funded amounts represent those amounts committed under contract by government agencies and prime contractors. Of the December 31, 2020 PAR Government contract backlog of $150.5 million, approximately $74.0 million is expected to be completed in calendar year 2021.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause significant disruption to the U.S. and global economies, including the impact of government and company actions to reduce the spread of the virus and consumer behavior in response to the same; and, although the United States and other countries have begun to roll out vaccinations, it is uncertain how quickly and effectively such vaccinations will be distributed or help to control the spread of COVID-19 and its variants.
Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, we took a number of actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our employees and business. We implemented temporary cost saving measures, which resulted in over $10 million of savings to our 2020 operating plan, and we introduced new product offerings to promote social distancing, offered subscription discounts and deferred payment arrangements to customers and continued to invest in our software products. While our 2020 reported revenues increased year-over-year despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic did not have a material adverse impact on our Government business in 2020, we cannot know the extent COVID-19 actually impacted our business, results of operations, and financial condition in 2020; and the ultimate extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. See “Risk Factors” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to actively manage our business to respond to the uncertainties and risks created by the pandemic throughout its duration, including evaluating our remote working plans on a regular basis and monitoring the health, safety, morale, and productivity of our employees. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of digitizing the modern restaurant, and we believe that our cloud solutions, hardware offerings and services uniquely positions us to be a leader in digital technology offerings to restaurants. We will continue to invest in product offerings and solutions to meet the digital needs of our customers by offering transformative technologies.
Intellectual Property and Other Rights
A number of our products and components are developed and designed based on our existing copyrighted work and/or patents issued. Our other products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. We establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary information through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, and registered and common law trademarks, that protect our brand associations and symbolize our goodwill, as well as copyrights that relate to internally-developed software and various distinctive characteristics of our products. We also rely on a combination of confidentiality and assignment-of-invention agreements with our employees and consultants, and enter into confidentiality and licensing agreements with customers and parties with whom we have strategic relationships. We believe our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets have value, and we believe our use and reliance on the intellectual property laws of the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as our agreements and licenses, protect and maintain our rights in our intellectual property and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts unauthorized third parties may attempt to use, copy, or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property and/or our other proprietary information; moreover, the rapidly changing technology in the Restaurant/Retail segment and the Government segment makes our future success dependent on the development skills, innovative designs, and technological expertise of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including with respect to data protection and privacy, import and export controls, trade restrictions, anti-corruption and bribery, and employee and labor relations. Please see our disclosure in “Risk Factors” for more details regarding laws and regulations governing our business.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,008 full-time employees, including approximately 54.7% in our Restaurant/Retail segment, 39.6% in our Government segment (17.5% of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements), and 5.8% who are corporate employees. We also employed 45 part-time employees as of December 31, 2020. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses, and thrive in an environment that reflects our values of speed and accountability. Our goal is to hire the best people we can find, give them the responsibility and authority they deserve, and let them make the decisions on how to best execute. We try to design our employee compensation and benefits programs to hold us to our values, while meeting the needs of our employees. Our chief executive officer and chief human resources officer regularly update our board of directors on key areas of our human capital strategy, including the following:
Diversity and Inclusion: We encourage our employees to embrace different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds. We are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We make all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. We strongly believe in building a workforce that is diverse and that can build strong working relationships with our customers.
Employee Engagement: We believe that our employees should have the opportunity to voice their concerns and suggestions. We conduct regular workforce engagement surveys to take the “pulse” of our employees and gather their insights. Being able to understand the needs, preferences and general feedback of our employees is critical to the design of our employee benefits programs. 
Health and Safety: The health and safety of our employees in the workplace are important to us. We regularly assess our facilities to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. The importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy has been underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we have taken, and will continue to take, actions in accordance with the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect our employees so they can more safely and effectively perform their work, including limiting travel to essential-business only, implementing work-from-home policies and augmenting shifts for our production employees.
