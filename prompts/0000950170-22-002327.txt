ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Broadmark Realty Capital Inc. (“Broadmark Realty,” “the Company,” “Successor,” “we,” “us” and “our”), a Maryland corporation, is an internally managed commercial real estate finance company that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2019. Based in Seattle, Washington, we specialize in underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio of short-term, first deed of trust loans to fund the construction and development of, or investment in, residential or commercial properties. We generally operate in states that we believe to have favorable demographic trends and that provide more efficient and quicker access to collateral in the event of borrower default. Beginning in early 2021, we have increased the number of states in which we operate in order to expand our potential lending markets. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio of 215 active loans had approximately $1.5 billion of total commitments and $924.7 million of principal outstanding. Our active loans are made across 164 borrowers in 19 states and the District of Columbia. We refer to loans that have outstanding commitments or principal balances that have not been repaid or retired, including loans in foreclosure, as “active loans.” Total commitments refer to the aggregate sum of outstanding principal balances, construction holdbacks and committed amounts for future draws and interest reserves on our loans. Historically, our loan portfolio was 100% equity funded, and we had no outstanding debt. On November 12, 2021, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 in a private placement. We plan to opportunistically issue debt and raise capital in the public and private markets from time to time based on market conditions to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and produce attractive returns for our stockholders. On February 19, 2021, we closed on a $135.0 million revolving credit facility, which has enabled us to use a larger percentage of our cash balances for lending activities.
 Properties securing our loans are generally classified as residential properties, commercial properties or undeveloped land, and are typically not income producing. Each loan is secured by a first deed of trust lien on real estate. Our lending policy limits the committed amount of each loan to a maximum loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of up to 65% of the “as-complete” appraised value of the underlying collateral as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination. Our lending policy also limits the initial outstanding principal balance of each loan to a maximum LTV of up to 65% of the “as-is” appraised value of the underlying collateral as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination. At the time of origination, the difference between the initial outstanding principal and the total commitment is the amount held back for future release subject to property inspections, progress reports and other conditions in accordance with the loan documents. Unless otherwise indicated, LTV is measured by the total commitment amount of the loan at origination divided by the “as-complete” appraisal. LTVs do not reflect interim activity such as construction draws or interest payments capitalized to loans, or partial repayments of the loan. The maximum amount of a single loan may not exceed 10% of our total assets and the maximum amount to a single borrower may not exceed 15% of our total assets. We consider the maximum LTV as an indicator for the credit quality of a mortgage note receivable. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average LTV was 59.1% across our active loan portfolio based on the total commitment of the loan and “as-complete” appraisals received at the time of loan origination. In addition, our loans are typically personally guaranteed on a recourse basis by the principals of the borrower, and/or others at our discretion to provide further credit support for the loan. The personal guarantee may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower or other real estate or assets owned by the guarantor.
 As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average total commitment of our active loans was $6.9 million with a weighted average interest rate of 10.7%. The weighted average term of our active loans was 13 months at origination, which we often elect to extend for several months based on our evaluation of the expected timeline for completion of construction. We usually receive loan origination fees, or “points,” which as of December 31, 2021 had a weighted average fee of 3.5% of total commitment at origination, along with loan amendment and extension fees, each of which varies in amount based upon the term of the loan, the credit quality of the borrower and the loan otherwise satisfying our underwriting criteria. In addition, we charge late fees on past due receivables and receive reimbursements from borrowers for costs associated with services provided by us, such as closing costs, collection costs on defaulted loans and construction draw inspection fees.
 Our typical borrowers include real estate investors, developers and other commercial borrowers. We do not lend to owner-occupants of residential real estate. Loan proceeds are generally used to fund the vertical construction, horizontal development, investment, land acquisition and refinancing of residential properties and commercial properties. We also make loans to fund the renovation and rehabilitation of residential and commercial properties. Our loans are generally structured with partial funding at closing and additional loan installments disbursed to the borrower upon satisfactory completion of previously agreed stages of construction.


Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from our customers and their referral of new business. We also receive leads for new business from real estate brokers and mortgage brokers, a limited amount of advertising, and through our website.
 We seek to minimize risk of loss through our disciplined underwriting standards. We originate and fund loans secured by first deed of trust liens on residential and commercial real estate located in states that we believe have favorable demographic trends and that provide more efficient and quicker access to collateral in the event of borrower default. We believe that the demand/supply imbalance for residential construction-related real estate loans presents significant opportunities for us to selectively originate high-quality first deed of trust loans on attractive terms.
 We built our business on a deep knowledge of the residential and commercial real estate market combined with a risk management approach that is designed to protect and preserve capital. We believe our flexibility and ability to structure loans that address the needs of our borrowers without compromising our standards on risk, our expertise in the loan market and our focus on newly originated first deed of trust loans have been the basis for our success.
 In addition to the natural seasonality inherent in our business whereby winter months are typically less favorable to construction, restrictions related to the Business Combination decreased the amount of our loan originations for the second half of 2019 and early 2020. The pending Business Combination required us to essentially pause our ability to raise capital and in turn originate new loans for most of the second half of 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we focused on rebuilding our pipeline and began to strategically deploy the proceeds from the Business Combination; these rebuilding efforts began to slow in March due to the uncertainty associated with the impacts of COVID-19. In March 2020, we launched a private real estate investment trust (the “Private REIT”) offered to qualified purchasers to provide access to an additional source of capital and fund participations in loans originated by Broadmark Realty. In August 2021, as part of the liquidation of the Private REIT, all participations in mortgage notes receivable held by the Private REIT were purchased for cash by the Company at the settlement value which approximated fair value of $43.5 million.
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an adverse impact on our loan portfolio beginning in 2020, primarily in the form of a significant increase in defaulted loans and a slow-down in construction progress. For example, delays in local government permitting and inspections arising from measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 delayed some projects, adversely affecting the ability of borrowers to complete the projects in accordance with the terms of the loans. We have experienced an increase in delinquencies and requests for extensions or forbearance. In addition, market conditions, and in some cases moratoriums on the foreclosure process, have increased the timeline to resolve non-performing loans. Delays in repayment of our outstanding loans or sales of foreclosed properties reduce the capital available for future loan originations.
 In 2021, the U.S. and global economy began reopening and wider distribution of effective vaccines for COVID-19 encouraged greater economic activity. Nonetheless, the recovery could remain uneven, particularly given uncertainty with respect to the distribution and acceptance of the vaccines and their effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19, including its new variant strains. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the timing and duration of the economic recovery, which precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic and market conditions. There remain shortages in raw materials, manufactured products and labor across industries that are resulting in longer construction timelines and rising prices, which are dampening a full economic recovery within the construction industry. The prolonged duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially disrupt our business operations and negatively impact our business, financial performance and operating results through December 31, 2022 and potentially longer.
Markets
 At December 31, 2021, we have active loans in 19 states and the District of Columbia with the majority of loans located in Washington, Colorado, Utah, and Texas. We strategically focus on these states as they have exhibited strong population growth. At December 31, 2021, more than 80% of our portfolio was secured by properties located in states ranked in the top ten for migration between 2010 and 2020 according to the Census Bureau, including Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Florida and Idaho. Additionally, each of Washington, Colorado, Utah, Texas, Oregon and Idaho are non-judicial foreclosure states, which we believe encourages borrowers to comply with the loan terms and provides us the option to take control of the collateral more quickly in the event of borrower default. We continue to increase our national presence, and in this regard, during 2021, we have increased the number of states in which we operate by 58% in order to expand our potential lending markets.

Industry and Market Opportunity
    Real estate investment is a capital-intensive business that typically relies heavily on debt capital to acquire, develop, improve, construct, renovate and maintain properties. We focus on providing construction, development and investment loans for the U.S. housing and real estate industries. Due to structural changes in banking, regulation and monetary policies over the last decade, there has been a reduction in the number of lenders servicing this segment. We believe there continues to be a significant market opportunity to originate real estate loans secured by the underlying real estate as collateral. Our management team further believes that the demand for relatively small real estate loans to construct, develop or invest in residential or commercial real estate, located in states with favorable demographic trends presents a compelling opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
 Historically, regional and community banks were the primary providers of construction financing to smaller, private builders. Over the past several decades, there has been significant consolidation within the commercial banking industry, with the number of commercial and savings institutions having decreased by 62% and 75%, respectively, between 1992 and 2020, as reported by the FDIC. In addition, many traditional real estate lenders that competed for loan origination within our target markets have been faced with tighter capital constraints due to changing banking regulations following the 2008 financial crisis. During 2021, as part of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a continued low interest rate environment, capital became widely available to lenders and resulted in new entrants to construction financing as well as reduced pricing by existing lenders. These factors have put significant pressure on asset yields and have often led to pricing in market that is not commensurate with the associated risk.
 While the number of traditional banks and construction loans offered by them has steadily declined, private residential construction spending and housing starts have continued to recover from the lows following the recession of 2007 through 2009. Housing starts in December 2021 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7 million, an increase of 2.5% from 2020. The U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development chart below illustrates historical housing permits, starts and completions from 2016 to 2021:
 


Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
While the increases are positive, housing starts and completions still remain below long term historical averages. In a February 2020 report, Freddie Mac estimated that there were 29 states that had a housing deficit, and that approximately 3.8 million units in the aggregate were needed to make up this deficit. The map below shows the housing deficit as a percentage of the housing supply by state as set forth in the report.
Estimate of Housing Stock Deficit as Proportion of State Housing Stock

Source: Freddie Mac
 We operate in seven of the ten states with the largest housing deficits. The ten states with the largest housing deficits have significant overlap with the states with the highest net migration rates between 2010 and 2020 according to the Census Bureau.
As a result of limited residential housing supply, net migration trends and the current low interest rate environment for home buyers, we believe the longer-term outlook for new housing demand in our markets remains strong.
 Per the U.S. Census Bureau, construction spending, measured as construction put in place, totaled $1.59 trillion in 2021, an increase of 8.2% over 2020. For 2022, ConstructConnect is expecting a 6.6% increase in construction spending, including a 5.6% increase in nonresidential construction, after two consecutive years of decreased construction spending caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Census Bureau construction spending data for December 2021 reported significant increases in the nonresidential sectors of commercial, including storage and retail, lodging and office, which are areas of expected growth for us in 2022.
Business and Growth Strategy
 Our objective is to preserve and protect stockholder capital while producing attractive risk-adjusted returns primarily through dividends generated by current income from our loan portfolio. Our business strategy is to directly originate, fund, manage, and service short-term loans secured by first mortgage liens on real property to enable us to generate attractive returns.
We believe our ability to react quickly and flexibility in terms of structuring loans to meet the needs of borrowers, consistency and expediency in funding future construction draws, intimate knowledge of the relevant markets in which we operate and focus on newly originated first deed of trust loans positions us to generate strong and consistent income. Our strategy to achieve our objective and grow our business includes the following:
 •continue to increase market share in existing states to satisfy unmet demand;
 •increase geographic footprint by focusing on states with favorable economic and demographic trends that provide efficient access to collateral in the event of borrower default;


Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
•capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market resulting from consolidation and increased regulatory oversight of commercial banks and savings institutions;
 •utilize the relative strength of our balance sheet to grow our customer and asset base while competitors with weaker balance sheets may be capital constrained;
 •maximize earnings generation from deployed capital through timely resolution of loans in contractual default;
 •optimize working capital through efficient cash management and the use of our revolving credit facility;
 •fund growth via strategic and structured capital sourcing to gradually lower our weighted average cost of capital while maintaining modest leverage relative to our peers;
 •remain flexible in order to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in various points of an economic cycle; and
 •operate so as to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.

Operations Overview
 Loan Origination and Due Diligence
 We are experienced in secured lending, with substantial combined real estate and financial services experience of our senior management team. Our senior management team spends a significant portion of its time on borrower development as well as on underwriting and structuring the loans in our portfolio. A principal source of our new transactions has been repeat business from existing and former customers and their referral of new business. We are a collateral-based lender and when underwriting a loan, the primary focus of our analysis is the value of a property and the borrower’s equity in the project. Prior to making a final decision on a loan application, we conduct extensive due diligence of the property as well as of the borrower and its principals.
 The mortgage loans that we originate generally meet the following criteria:
 •Collateral. New loans are secured by a first deed of trust lien on real estate.
 •Amount. The weighted average total commitment of our active loans was $6.9 million at December 31, 2021. Our lending policy limits exposure to any single borrower or guarantor to 15% of our total assets.
 •Loan to Value. The maximum LTV ratio for a loan at origination is 65.0% of the "as-complete" appraised value of the underlying collateral; and a maximum initial outstanding principal balance of the loan at origination is 65% of the “as-is” appraised value of the underlying collateral, in each case as determined by an independent appraiser at the time of the loan origination.
 •Interest rate. Our portfolio weighted average interest rate was 10.7% at December 31, 2021 with a late fee of 10% of the principal and receivables outstanding and a default interest rate of 24% per annum for loans in contractual default status.
 •Origination fees. Our portfolio weighted average fee was 3.5% of the total commitment at origination at December 31, 2021. In addition, if the term of the loan is extended, additional points are payable upon the extension.
 •Term. The weighted average term of our active loans was 13 months at origination at December 31, 2021. We may agree to extend the maturity date (typically for one to three months) and charge an extension fee, so long as the borrower complies with all loan covenants and the loan otherwise satisfies our underwriting criteria.
 •Covenants. To timely pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and similar charges with respect to the property; to maintain hazard insurance; and to maintain and protect the property.
 •Events of default. Include: (i) failure to make the required monthly interest-only loan payment when due; (ii) failure to repay the loan at maturity date if we have not agreed to extend maturity and (iii) breach of a covenant.
 •Payment terms. Interest only is payable monthly in arrears. Principal is due in a “balloon” payment at the maturity date. Interest earned from an interest holdback is capitalized in the loan principal balance.
 •Escrow. Generally, none required.
 •Holdbacks. Construction loans typically include a holdback for future construction draws which are funded in arrears following confirmation of work completion. Loans may also include a holdback for interest reserves for the purpose of satisfying monthly interest payments over all or part of the term of the loan due to a lack of income generated by the real estate.
 •Security. Each loan is evidenced by a promissory note, which is secured by a first deed of trust lien on real property owned by the borrower and is typically personally guaranteed on a recourse basis by the principals of the borrower and/or others, at our discretion, which guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower or other real estate owned by the guarantor.
 •Insurance. Each loan is required to carry minimum insurance policies for general liability and builders' risk, which are verified as a part of the underwriting process.
 •Fees and Expenses. As is typical in real estate finance transactions, the borrower incurs all expenses in connection with securing the loan, including the cost of a property appraisal, the cost of an environmental assessment report, if any, the cost of a credit report and all title, recording fees and legal fees.

Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Upon receipt of a potential borrower’s executed loan application, we will commence the underwriting process. Before approving and funding a loan, we undertake extensive due diligence of the borrower, its principals, the guarantor and the property that will be mortgaged to secure the loan. Such due diligence generally includes:
 •Borrower and Guarantor Information. Review of a borrower’s credit application, operating agreement or other organizational documents, and review of business and guarantor financial statements and tax returns.
 •Confirmatory Collateral Information. Review of an independent appraisal report (customarily including market data and analysis and information regarding comparable properties), preliminary title report, tax records, documentation evidencing proper hazard insurance for improved property, and other property information. Loans secured by existing commercial properties require a Phase I environmental site assessment.
 •Project Transaction Information. Review of the property purchase and sale agreement, title insurance, itemized construction budget, project schedule with milestones, building permits/entitlements, building plans, and building specifications and architectural renderings, resumes and recent projects of builder and architect and marketing plans and materials.
 •Physical Inspection. We perform a physical inspection of the property, which includes a check of the property’s location, characteristics, qualities, and potential value as represented by the borrower, as well as a review of the comparable properties identified in the independent appraisal report in order to confirm that the properties identified as comparable in the appraisal report are truly comparable.
Loan Servicing
 We service all of our loans internally, and manage loan payments, draw requests, and loan accounting records. The loan draw process in particular is an important part of our business as it provides borrowers with quick access to capital in order to keep their projects moving and allows us to inspect the quality and pace of the borrower’s work. Once a borrower has submitted a draw request, we will have the property physically inspected by an approved third-party to ensure that the work for which funding is being requested has been completed in a manner satisfactory to us. In addition, any required county and city inspections are completed and a date-down endorsement of the title policy is typically provided by the title company indicating no liens have been placed on the property since its original issuance of the title insurance policy before funds are disbursed. If the request is made for the final draw of a project, a certificate of occupancy or sign-off by the city is required prior to disbursement. Although the process is thorough, we make a point of responding to draw requests as quickly as possible as timing is of paramount importance to a project’s success.
 In addition, we conduct periodic testing, process loan payoff requests, and collect past due and delinquent payments. In the case of a contractual loan default, we have broad authority to take such actions as we believe best in working out the defaulted loan, including selling the defaulted loan or foreclosing on the real property serving as collateral for the loan.
 Loan Funding
 Historically, our ability to grow our business was primarily constrained by our ability to raise capital to fund additional real estate loans. Prior to the Business Combination, we funded loans primarily through the use of private capital. Going forward, we intend to fund our growth through issuance of debt and equity capital in the public and private markets and use of cash management tools such as our revolving credit facility.
Competition
 Real estate lending is a competitive business. We compete for lending opportunities with a variety of institutional lenders and investors, including other “hard money” lenders, mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage banks, credit unions, insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, private equity real estate funds, hedge funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, non-bank financial institutions, governmental bodies, family offices, and high net worth individuals. New parties continue to enter the market resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure.
We primarily compete on the basis of borrower relationships, product offerings, loan structure, terms, and service rather than on price. Our success depends on our ability to maintain and capitalize on relationships with borrowers and their representatives, offer creative structures and attractive loan terms and, most importantly, provide superior service.
Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Seasonality
 While we typically originate loans year-round, incremental loan disbursements are made with greater frequency during the spring, summer and fall, when weather is generally more favorable for construction, and borrowers complete previously agreed stages of construction, allowing developers to draw down on additional amounts of capital available under their loan agreements. As a result of these more frequent disbursements, we generally maintain greater total liquidity to fund disbursements during these seasons.
Human Capital
 Our culture is defined by our core values of integrity, collaboration, diversity, accountability, reliability and community. Our employees represent our greatest asset. We value our employees by investing in a healthy work-life balance, competitive compensation and benefit packages and a vibrant, team-oriented environment centered on open and compassionate communication. We strive to build and maintain a high-performing culture by creating a work environment that attracts and retains outstanding, engaged employees who embody our company mission of “Empowering real estate developers and investors to improve places and spaces in our communities.” The most significant human capital measures or objectives that we focus on in managing our business and our related human capital initiatives include the following:
•Demographics. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 60 full-time employees across the United States. During 2021 we hired 17 employees. Our voluntary turnover rate was 11.7% in 2021. 
 •Diversity and Inclusion. We strive toward having a diverse team of employees, knowing we are better together with our combined wisdom and intellect. With a commitment to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity, we focus on understanding, accepting, and valuing the differences between people. We value and embrace diversity in our employee recruiting, hiring and development practices. Of our employee population, approximately 45% are women and approximately 40% have self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, Asian, Black or African American, or of two or more races. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment.
 •Compensation and Benefits. We provide a competitive compensation and benefits program to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include discretionary annual bonuses and stock awards, a 401(k) Plan with an employer matching contribution and no service-based vesting requirement, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings, paid time off, family leave and an employee assistance program. 
 •Communication and Engagement.  We strongly believe that our success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including weekly company-wide calls with executives and frequent email corporate communications. To continuously monitor and improve employee performance and engagement, we conduct annual performance reviews and engagement surveys. We also provide training to our people managers on management and leadership development.
 •Health, Safety and Wellness. The health, safety, and wellness of our employees are vital to our success. In 2020 and continuing to date, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted to a remote work environment ahead of mandatory stay-at-home orders and provided employees with resources, including virtual tools and ergonomic equipment, to maximize work-from-home efficiency.
 •Community Partnership. We match each employee’s financial contribution to eligible nonprofit organizations on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to $1,000 per employee each calendar year, to increase the impact of their charitable gifts. Each employee also receives eight hours per calendar year of paid volunteer time off to use at the eligible non-profit(s) of his or her choice, and we donate $25 to the organization for each hour volunteered by our employees.
 Regulation and Compliance
 Our operations are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and U.S. federal government authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, Broadmark Realty and our subsidiaries may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may, in certain circumstances, depend on compliance by third parties who we do not control.
Broadmark Realty Capital Inc.
 
Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities
 In general, commercial real estate lending is a highly regulated industry in the United States. Certain states have adopted laws or regulations that may, among other requirements, require licensing of lenders and financiers, prescribe disclosures of certain contractual terms, impose limitations on interest rates and other charges, and limit or prohibit certain collection practices and creditor remedies. We are required to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the states in which we do business. We are also required to comply with, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the USA Patriot Act, and regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control.
Exemptions from Investment Management Regulation
 Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, we believe that none of the Company or our subsidiary that issues and holds the mortgages (the “Mortgage Subsidiary”) is currently required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, our business strategies may evolve over time.
 
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term “investment securities” are, among other things, securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
 The Company believes it will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because it will not engage primarily, or propose to engage primarily, or hold itself out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, the Company is primarily engaged in the non-investment company business of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
    The Company believes that it will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. The Company is a holding company that conducts its operations and holds assets primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Mortgage Subsidiary. The Mortgage Subsidiary is excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which provides an exclusion for companies engaged primarily in investment in mortgages and other liens on or interests in real estate. In order to qualify for this exclusion, the Mortgage Subsidiary must maintain, on the basis of positions taken by the SEC’s Division of Investment Management in interpretive and no-action letters, a minimum of 55% of the value of its total assets in mortgage loans and other related assets that are considered “mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate” (“Qualifying Interests”), and a minimum of 80% in Qualifying Interests and real estate-related assets. In the absence of SEC guidance that supports the treatment of other investments as Qualifying Interests, the Mortgage Subsidiary will treat those other investments appropriately as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous assets depending on the circumstances. With respect to the Company’s other subsidiaries that maintain this exclusion or another exclusion or exception under the Investment Company Act (other than Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof), or otherwise do not meet the definition of “investment company,” the Company’s interests in these subsidiaries do not and will not constitute “investment securities.”
    Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is required to register under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or under any state securities laws, based on their current activities.
