On July 17, 2019, immediately after completion of the merger, we changed our name to “Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc.”
 The merger was treated as a reverse recapitalization transaction under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. For accounting purposes, EMI is considered to have acquired us. The merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, primarily for rare and orphan diseases. On July 7, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved our lead product, Endari® (prescription grade L-glutamine oral powder), which is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease (“SCD”) in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. Endari® has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and Orphan Medical designation from the European Commission, which designations afford marketing exclusivity for Endari® for a seven-year period in the U.S. and ten-year period in the European Union, respectively, following marketing approval. 
 We commenced commercialization of Endari® in the U.S. in January 2018 in collaboration with a contract sales organization. Since January 2020, we have relied upon our internal commercial sales team. Endari® is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari® for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. We have agreements in place with the nation’s leading distributors, as well as physician group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefits managers, making Endari® available at selected retail and specialty pharmacies nationwide. We expect net revenue to increase as we expand our commercialization of Endari® in the United States and grow or commence early access programs and eventual marketing and commercialization of Endari® outside the United States.
 
SCD is a rare, debilitating and lifelong hereditary blood disorder that affects approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and up to 25 million patients worldwide, the majority of which are of African descent. Approximately one in every 365 African-American children are born with SCD. FDA approval of Endari® was based upon the results of a 48-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the effects of Endari®, as compared to placebo in 230 adults and children with SCD. The results demonstrated that Endari® reduced the frequency of sickle cell crises by 25% and hospitalizations by 33%. Additional findings included a 41% decrease in cumulative hospital days and greater than 60% fewer incidents of acute chest syndrome in patients treated with Endari®. In addition, the FDA has acknowledged that the clinical benefit of Endari® was observed irrespective of hydroxyurea use, which supports the use of Endari® as a monotherapy or in combination with hydroxyurea as safe and effective treatment options for patients with SCD.
 
The safety of Endari® was based upon data from 298 patients, 187 treated with Endari® and 111 patients treated with placebo in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. Endari®’s safety profile was similar to that of placebo and Endari® was well-tolerated in pediatric and adult patients alike. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in more than 10% of patients treated with Endari®, were constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in extremity, back pain, and chest pain (non-cardiac).
 
On July 4, 2018, the FDA acknowledged receipt of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for the treatment of diverticulosis using the same prescription grade L-glutamine oral powder (PGLG) used in Endari®. We subsequently received a “Study May Proceed” letter from the FDA. In April 2019, we commenced a Pilot/Phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of PGLG oral powder in diverticulosis. The study will evaluate the change in the number and size of colonic diverticula and assess safety in a total of up to 10 to 15 patients at multiple study sites. The COVID-19 pandemic has slowed 
 6

the progress of clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry, in general. However, patient enrollment has now been completed.
 
On August 5, 2020, we announced preliminary top-line data for two patients who had most recently completed the first six months of the scheduled twelve months of treatment in a pilot study of diverticulosis. The following table summarizes the data:
 Number of diverticula in the sigmoid colon following six months treatment on PGLG
  
Patient | Baseline | Six Months | Percentage Reduction
52 year old female | 8 | 4 | 50% 
59 year old female | 7 | 0 | 100% 

 
In each of these patients, the investigator also noted the appearance of healthier mucosa with pinkish coloration compared to the baseline. There were no safety concerns reported by the patients. Our study observations are focused on diverticula in the sigmoid colon, the most frequent site for diverticulitis.
 An Emmaus-led team at The Lundquist Institute, formerly known as the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, or TLI, an independent non-profit biomedical research organization academically affiliated with the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, at Los Angeles that works in partnership with Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, is conducting pre-clinical studies of Cultured Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell Sheet, or CAOMECS, technology licensed by us from CellSeed Inc., a Japanese company, which we refer to as CellSeed. Our lead CAOMECS program is for the treatment of corneal diseases. The development of CAOMECS for treating corneal and other diseases is in the early stages.
 Sickle Cell Disease—Market Overview
 
Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder that affects 20 million - 25 million people worldwide and occurs with increasing frequency among those whose ancestors are from regions including sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the Caribbean, Central America, the Middle East, India and Mediterranean regions such as Turkey, Greece and Italy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are as many as 100,000 patients with SCD in the United States, and we estimate there are approximately 80,000 patients in the EU. We estimate that there are over 100,000 SCD patients that could potentially be treated in the Persian Gulf States, as well as patients in other countries that comprise the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. 
 
SCD is characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing the red blood cells of patients with SCD to become sickle‑shaped, inflexible and adhesive rather than round, smooth and flexible. The complications associated with SCD occur when these inflexible and sticky cells block, or occlude, small blood vessels, which can then cause severe and chronic pain throughout the body due to insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, or ischemia, and inflammation. According to an article in Annals of Internal Medicine, “In the Clinic: Sickle Cell Disease” by M.H. Steinberg (September 2011), which we refer to as the Steinberg Article, this leads to long‑term organ damage, diminished exercise tolerance, increased risk of stroke and infection and decreased lifespan.
 Sickle cell crisis, a broad term covering a range of disorders, is one of the most devastating complications of SCD. Types of sickle cell crisis include:
  
• | Vaso‑occlusive crisis, characterized by obstructed blood flow to organs such as the bones, liver, kidneys, eyes or central nervous system;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aplastic crisis, characterized by acute anemia typically due to viral infection;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hemolytic crisis, characterized by accelerated red blood cell death and reduced hemoglobin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Splenic sequestration crisis, characterized by painful enlargement of the spleen due to trapped red blood cells; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7

 
• | Acute chest syndrome, a potentially life‑threatening obstruction of blood supply to the lungs characterized by fever, chest pain, cough, and lung infiltrates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 According to the Steinberg Article, acute chest syndrome affects more than half of all patients with SCD and is a common reason for hospitalization. Other symptoms and complications of SCD include swelling of the hands and feet, infections, pneumonia, vision loss, leg ulcers, gall stones and stroke.
 A crisis is characterized by excruciating musculoskeletal pain, visceral pain and pain in other locations. These crises occur periodically throughout the life of a person with SCD. In adults, the acute pain typically persists for five or ten days or longer, followed by a dull, aching pain generally ending only after several weeks and sometimes persisting between crises. According to the Steinberg Article, the frequency of sickle cell crises varies within patients with SCD from rare occurrences to occurrences several times a month. The frequency of crises tends to increase late in the second decade of life and to decrease after the fourth decade. 
 Treatment of sickle cell crises is burdensome and expensive for patients and payors, as it encompasses costs for hospitalization, urgent care and emergency room visits and prescription pain medication. Endari® enhances nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (“NAD”) synthesis to reduce excessive oxidative stress in sickle red blood cells, which is the cause of much of the damage leading to characteristic symptoms of SCD. We believe that Endari®, when taken daily, will decrease the incidence of sickle cell crisis by restoring the flexibility and function of red blood cells in patients with SCD. We believe that regular use of Endari® also will reduce the number of costly hospitalizations of patients with SCD, as well as unexpected urgent care and emergency room visits.
 8

Limitations of the Current Standard of Care
 Prior to the approval of Endari®, the only other FDA approved pharmaceutical targeting sickle cell crisis was hydroxyurea, which is available in both generic and branded formulations. Hydroxyurea, a drug originally developed as an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent, has been approved as a once‑daily oral treatment for reducing the frequency of sickle cell crisis and the need for blood transfusions in adult patients with recurrent moderate to severe sickle cell crisis. In December 2017, the FDA granted Addmedica a regular approval for hydroxyurea (Siklos) to reduce the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions in pediatric patients two years of age and older with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises. While hydroxyurea has been shown to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crisis in some patient groups, it is not suitable for many patients due to significant toxicities and side effects. In particular, hydroxyurea can cause a severe decrease in the number of blood cells in a patient’s bone marrow, which may increase the risk that the patient will develop a serious infection or bleeding, or that the patient will develop certain cancers. Another potential treatment option for SCD, bone marrow transplant, is limited in its use due to the lack of availability of matched donors and the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease, infection and potentially death, as well as by its high cost.
 Two new treatments for sickle cell disease were approved by the FDA at the end of 2019. Crizanlizumab, marketed under the brand name of Adakveo® by Novartis AG, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to P-selectin. It was approved by the FDA on November 15, 2019 to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises in adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with SCD. It is administered intravenously in two loading doses two weeks apart and every four weeks thereafter. Voxelotor, marketed under the brand name of Oxbryta™ by Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., is an HbS polymerization inhibitor that reversibly binds to hemoglobin to stabilize the oxygenated hemoglobin state, thus shifting the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Voxelotor was approved by the FDA on November 25, 2019 for the treatment of SCD in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.
 Upon onset of sickle cell crisis, the current standard of care is focused on pain management, often with prescription narcotics or non-prescription oral medications taken at home. If the pain is not relieved, or if it progresses, patients may seek medical attention in a clinic or emergency department. Pain that is not controlled in these settings may require hospitalization for more potent pain medications, typically opioids administered intravenously. The patient must stay in the hospital to receive these intravenous pain medications until the sickle cell crisis resolves and the pain subsides. Other supportive measures during hospitalization may include hydration, supplemental oxygen and treatment of any concurrent infections or other conditions.
 According to Hematology in Clinical Practice, by Robert S. Hillman et. al. (5th ed. 2011), sickle cell crisis, once it has started, almost always results in tissue damage at the affected site in the body, increasing the importance of preventative measures. While pain medications can be effective in managing pain during sickle cell crisis, they do not affect or resolve the underlying vascular occlusion, tissue ischemia or potential tissue damage. Additionally, opioid narcotics that are generally prescribed to treat pain can also lead to tissue or organ damage and resulting complications and morbidities, prolonged hospital stays and associated continuation of pain and suffering. Given the duration and frequency of sickle cell crises, addiction to these opioid narcotics is also a significant concern.
 Endari®, Our Solution for SCD
 We believe Endari® may provide a safe and effective means for reducing the frequency of sickle cell crises in patients with SCD and the need for costly hospital stays or treatment with highly addictive pain medications such as opioid narcotics. Published academic research has identified L-glutamine as a precursor to NAD, one of the major molecules that regulate and prevent oxidative damage in red blood cells. Several published studies have demonstrated that sickle red blood cells have a significantly increased rate of transport of L-glutamine, which appears to be driven by the cells’ synthesis of NAD to protect against oxidative damage and thereby leading to further improvement in their regulation of oxidative stress. In turn this makes sickle red blood cells less adhesive to cells of the interior wall of blood vessels, which suggests that there is decreased chance of blockage of blood vessels, especially small ones. In summary, improved regulation of oxidative stress appears to lead to less obstruction or blockage of small blood vessels, thereby alleviating a major cause of the pain and other problems associated with SCD.
 In December 2013, we completed a Phase 3 prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group multicenter clinical trial to measure, over a 48-week time frame, as its primary outcome, the reduction in the number of occurrences of sickle cell crises experienced by patients in the trial. All participants other than those who received placebo, including children, received up to 30 grams of Endari® daily, dissolved in liquid, split between morning and evening; the same dosage as our Phase 2 clinical trial completed in 2009. Patients were randomized to the study treatment using a 2:1 ratio of Endari® to placebo. The randomization was stratified by investigational site and hydroxyurea usage.
 9

The clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Endari® in 230 patients (5 to 58 years of age) with sickle cell anemia or sickle β°-thalassemia who had 2 or more painful crises within 12 months prior to enrollment. Eligible patients stabilized on hydroxyurea for at least 3 months continued their therapy throughout the study. The trial excluded patients who had received blood products within 3 weeks, had renal insufficiency or uncontrolled liver disease, or were pregnant (or planning pregnancy) or lactating. Study patients received Endari® or placebo for a treatment duration of 48 weeks followed by 3 weeks of tapering.
 
Efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in the number of sickle cell crises through Week 48 and prior to the start of tapering among patients that received Endari® compared to patients who received placebo. A sickle cell crisis was defined as a visit to an emergency room/medical facility for sickle cell disease-related pain which was treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or parenterally administered ketorolac. In addition, the occurrence of acute chest syndrome, priapism, and splenic sequestration were considered sickle cell crises. Treatment with Endari® also resulted in fewer hospitalizations due to sickle cell pain at Week 48, fewer cumulative days in hospital and a lower incidence of acute chest syndrome.

 2. Hazard Ratio=0.69 (95% CI=0.52, 0.93), estimated based on unstratified Cox’s proportional model. Median time and 95% CI were estimated based on the Kaplan Meier method.
 
The recurrent crisis event time analysis (Figure 1) yielded an intensity rate ratio (IRR) value of 0.75 with 95% CI= (0.62, 0.90) and (0.55, 1.01) based on unstratified models using the Andersen-Gill and Lin, Wei, Yang and Ying methods, respectively in favor of Endari®, suggesting that over the entire 48- week period, the average cumulative crisis count was reduced by 25% from the Endari® group over the placebo group.
 
Figure 1. Recurrent Event Time for Sickle Cell Crises by Treatment Group


Endari® was studied in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials (a phase 3 study, n=230 and a phase 2 study, n=70). In these trials, patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle β0-thalassemia were randomized to receive Endari® (n=187) or placebo (n=111) orally twice daily for 48 weeks followed by 3 weeks of tapering. Both studies included pediatric and adult patients (5-58 years of age) and 54% were female.

Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 2.7% (n=5) of patients receiving Endari®. These adverse reactions included one case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash.
 
Serious adverse reactions were reported in both treatment groups, more frequently in the placebo group, and were consistent with the underlying disease.
 
Three deaths (3/187=1.6%) occurred during the study in the Endari® treatment group as compared to none in the placebo treatment group. None of the deaths were considered to be related to Endari® treatment. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 10% of patients treated with Endari® are shown in Table 2 below.

 Commercialization and Distribution
 United States
 
In January 2018 we commenced commercialization of Endari® in the U.S utilizing a contract sales organization or CSO to support our internal sales activities. We terminated our relationship with the CSO in December 2019 and in January 2020 we internalized the sales function in order to have greater control over sales activities. Our in-house commercial team encompasses marketing, market access, patient support, and distribution support personnel. The sales team consists of sales representatives, sales management, and a National Sales Director.  In February 2019 we established a Commercial Patient Assistance Program (C- PAP) to provide financial assistance to eligible patients who are unable to afford their monthly co-payments for Endari®. 
 
Our sales and marketing efforts focus on the following groups: pediatric and adult hematologists who treat SCD patients with sickle cell disease, Community Based Organizations, or CBOs, government payors, insurance companies, and pharmacy benefit managers. SCD patients are primarily treated at specialized clinics located in children’s hospitals, university hospitals and community-based out-patient locations. The current focus of our sales team is as follows:
 •        educating prescribers and CBOs on the approved use and benefits of Endari®; and
 •        establishing collaborative relationships with CBOs and patient support groups that focus on SCD education and patient advocacy in their respective communities. 
 
We have contracted with AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ASD Healthcare LLC and US Bioservices Corporation), AmerisourceBergen Corporation companies, McKesson Plasma and Biologics LLC, a McKesson Corporation company, and Cardinal Health 108, LLC, a Cardinal Health Inc. company, to distribute Endari® to selected pharmacies and hospitals. AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. are the three largest specialty distributors of prescription drugs in the U.S.
 
Our two largest distributors, ASD Healthcare and McKesson Plasma and Biologics LLC, each account for more than 20% of units sold for the year ended December 31, 2019. On a combined basis, the three distributors accounted for approximately 87% of our units sold in 2019.

Outside the United States
 
In July 2012, the European Commission, or EC, granted Orphan Drug Designation status in the European Union, or EU, for our prescription grade L-glutamine oral powder, to be known as Xyndari™ in the EU, for the treatment of SCD. In January 2018, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, provided their agreement on the pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, for Xyndari™ and we filed with the MEA an application for marketing authorization, or MAA, in the EU. In May 2019, we announced that the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, adopted a negative opinion regarding our MAA based upon the CHMP’s position that our main clinical study did not conclusively support the efficacy of the treatment in SCD patients, although no safety concerns were raised. In light of the CHMP’s opinion, we withdrew our MAA in September 2019 to consider pursuing alternative decentralized and centralized regulatory pathways for obtaining marketing authorization in an effort to ensure access to Xyndari™ for patients afflicted by SCD.
 
We are in the process of meeting with the regulatory authorities at the EMA and perhaps in other EU member nations to determine whether there is a viable regulatory path forward for Xyndari™, including whether or what additional data might be necessary to support future MAAs. With Brexit in place, we will also work directly with the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, to determine the regulatory pathway for Xyndari™ in the U.K. We expect to provide an update in the first half of 2021 on the outcome of these efforts. On June 17, 2020 Endari® was approved for marketing in Israel by the Israeli Ministry of Health for the same indication approved under the FDA. On November 10, 2020, we announced the submission of a temporary license application for Endari® to the National Health Regulatory Authority in the Kingdom of Bahrain as a prerequisite for marketing authorization there. The temporary license will allow Endari® to be prescribed in the Kingdom pending marketing authorization. We are also currently engaged in marketing regulatory submissions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Coast Cooperation Council countries. 
  We have entered into exclusive distribution agreements with strategic partners to register, commercialize and distribute Endari® in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and other countries throughout the MENA region in collaboration with our office in Dubai. Under the terms of the agreements the distributors generally are responsible for registration and will bear all or substantially all costs for commercialization in their respective countries in return for a share in net revenues from Endari® sales in the countries. 
 We also are party to an exclusive early access agreement with a strategic partner in the EU pursuant to which our partner distributes Endari® on an early access basis only in France and certain other EU member states. We also are in talks with potential strategic partners in other countries to establish similar early access programs while we consider seeking marketing authorization in one of more of such countries.
 We also may seek future collaborations with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and identify potential licensees and other international opportunities to commercialize Endari®, if approved by foreign regulatory authorities.
 
Diverticulosis
 
Diverticulosis, or the presence of colonic diverticula (i.e., pouches in the colon wall), is very common in industrialized nations, with its prevalence increasing with age. An estimated 40% of 60 year-olds and 70% of 80 year-olds have diverticulosis. Of these patients, 10% to 25% are expected to develop diverticulitis, or the advancement of peridiverticular inflammation and infection, resulting in abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, fever, and leukocytosis.
 
The pathogenesis of diverticulosis is believed to result from structural abnormalities of the colonic wall, disordered motility and low fiber diets. The relationships between glutamine and intestinal physiology have been extensively studied in inflammatory bowel diseases (i.e., ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease), short bowel syndrome and as a nutritional therapy for critical illnesses. Overall, glutamine elicits the following mechanisms of action within intestinal cells: promotion of enterocyte proliferation, regulation of tight junction proteins; suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways; suppression of intestinal cell apoptosis and cellular stress; and microbiome regulation. Glutamine also helps to maintain intestinal tissue integrity through various signaling pathways.
 12

See the discussion above of our Pilot/Phase 1 study of the safety and efficacy of prescription grade L-glutamine oral powder in diverticulosis. 
 We are party to a distributor agreement with Telcon pursuant to which we granted Telcon exclusive rights to our PGLG oral powder for the treatment of diverticulosis in South Korea, Japan and China. The agreement contemplates that Telcon will be responsible at its expense for obtaining marketing authorization assuming FDA approval is obtained and for all other commercial activities in the territories. In exchange for the exclusive rights, Telcon paid us a $10 million upfront fee, which is refundable in the event of termination of the distributor agreement for failure to obtain FDA approval, and agreed in the distributor agreement to purchase from us specified minimum quantities of the finished product.
 CellSeed Collaboration
 In June 2016, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with the Japanese company, CellSeed, Inc. (“CellSeed”), and Dr. Kohji Nishida of the Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Japan, for the development of Cultured Autologous Oral Mucosal Epithelial Cell Sheet (“CAOMECS”) for the treatment of corneal impairments in the United States. Under the agreement, we will be required to pay a single-digit royalty based upon net sales of the technology.
 
A cell sheet is a composite of cells grown and harvested in an intact sheet, rather than as individual cells. These cell sheets can be used for tissue transplantation or to engineer complex multilayer cell sheets composed of different types of cells. CellSeed’s technology involves culturing cells on a surface coated with the poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) temperature responsive polymer. The thinness of this polymer coating is measured at the nanometer scale. The cells cultured on this polymer can be harvested intact as a composite stratified cell sheet to transplant it precisely on the cornea. Using a patient’s own oral mucosal epithelial cells, we are working toward being able to grow and harvest a cell sheet for directly transplanting onto the cornea of the patient’s affected eye to repair the damaged cornea.
 
See the discussion above of preclinical studies on our lead CAOMECS program for treatment of corneal diseases. 
 Research and Development
 We spent $2.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, in 2019 and 2018 on research and development, primarily relating to our Pilot/Phase 1 diverticulosis study. None of these costs are borne or sponsored by our customers.
Raw Materials and Manufacturing
 Our SCD treatment uses prescription grade L‑glutamine (“PGLG”), which differs from non‑prescription grade L‑glutamine available as a nutritional supplement. There are limited suppliers of PGLG, and we currently obtain all our PGLG, directly or indirectly, from a single supplier, Ajinomoto Health and Nutrition North America, Inc. (“Ajinomoto”), a subsidiary of Ajinomoto North American Holdings, Inc. 
 
Ajinomoto provided PGLG to us free of charge for our clinical trials of Endari®, including our Phase 3 trial. In return, we have agreed to purchase from Ajinomoto substantially all our commercial needs for PGLG, subject to certain exceptions. We have no long-term supply agreement with Ajinomoto.
 
On June 12, 2017, we entered into an API supply agreement with Telcon RF Pharmaceutical, Inc. (formerly, Telcon, Inc.), a South Korea-based company, or Telcon, pursuant to which Telcon paid us approximately ₩36.0 billion KRW (approximately $31.8 million USD) in consideration of the right to supply 25% of our requirements for bulk containers of PGLG for a 15-year term. The amount was recorded as a deferred trade discount. On July 12, 2017, we entered into a raw material supply agreement with Telcon which revised certain terms of the API supply agreement, which we refer to as the “revised API agreement.” The revised API agreement is effective for a term of five years and will renew automatically for 10 successive one-year renewal periods, except as either party may determine. In the revised API agreement, we have agreed to purchase a total of 940,000 kilograms of PGLG at a fixed price of $50 per kilogram, or a total of $47.0 million, over the term of the agreement. In September 2018, we entered into an agreement with Ajinomoto and Telcon to facilitate Telcon’s purchase of PGLG from Ajinomoto for resale to us under the revised API agreement.
 
On June 27, 2019, we entered into an agreement with Telcon to adjust the price payable to Telcon under the revised API agreement from $50 per kilogram of PGLG to $100 kilogram from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 with the price payable after June 30, 2020 to be subject to agreement between the parties. The PGLG raw material purchased from Telcon is recorded in inventory at net realizable value and the excess purchase price is recorded against deferred trade discount.

See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for a discussion of our pledge of marketable securities and other collateral to secure our obligations under the revised API Agreement.
 
In December 2019, EJ Holdings, Inc., or EJ Holdings a Japanese corporation which is 40% owned by us, purchased from Kyowa Hakko Bio Co. Ltd., or Kyowa, a subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Kyowa’s phased-out facility in Ube, Japan, 
for the manufacture of L-glutamine and other amino acids. EJ Holdings is engaged in phasing in the plant, including obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for the manufacture of PGLG in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”). Once the plant is active, we expect to enter into a long-term agreement with EJ Holdings for the supply of PGLG. EJ Holdings has had no revenues since its inception, has depended on loans from us to acquire the Ube plant and fund its operations and will continue to be dependent on loans from us or other financing unless and until its plant is activated and it can secure customers, including us, for its products. As of October 31, 2020, we had loaned EJ Holdings a total of $16.0 million, including $2.8 million of loans made pursuant to our written commitment dated October 28, 2020 to loan EJ Holdings a total of up to $6.5 million through the period ending March 31, 2021. In addition to loans from us, EJ Holdings may require substantial financing in order bring the Ube plant online. EJ Holdings has no commitments or understandings regarding any additional financing. Under the asset purchase agreement pursuant to which EJ Holdings purchased the Ube plant, Kyowa has the right to repurchase the plant at the purchase price, plus certain taxes, paid by EJ Holdings if the plant does not become operational within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed five years).
 
In May 2020 we entered into a memorandum of understanding and agreement, or MOU, with Japan Industrial Partners, Inc., or JIP, which owns 60% of the capital stock of EJ Holdings, to memorialize the parties’ intentions with respect to the business and operations of the Ube plant and ownership of EJ Holdings. The MOU contemplates, among other things, that we will continue to be the principal source of funding for EJ Holdings’ ownership and operation of the plant and that, subject to certain conditions, to the extent we provide additional funding our ownership interest in EJ Holdings is expected to increase according and that the composition of EJ Holdings’ board of directors and control of EJ Holdings would be modified consistent with the parties’ relative ownership interests. The MOU also contemplates that the Ube plant will eventually supply us with the plant’s output of amino acids and that the operation of the plant will be principally for our benefit and, as such, that major decisions affecting EJ Holdings and the Ube plant will be made by EJ Holdings’ board of directors in consultation with us. At present, JIP owns 60% of EJ Holdings and is entitled to designate a majority of EJ Holdings’ board of directors, its Chief Executive Officer and outside auditors, and as such, controls the management, business and operations of EJ Holdings.
 
Endari® and any other commercial products we develop must be manufactured and packaged by facilities that meet FDA requirements for cGMP. Ajinomoto and Packaging Coordinators, Inc., or PCI, of Rockville, Illinois, which packages Endari®, currently meet FDA cGMP for manufacture and packaging of our commercial supplies of Endari®. Previous compliance with cGMP; however, does not guarantee future compliance. We have no long-term agreement with Ajinomoto or PCI. We may seek to enter into long-term supply agreements and to establish one or more arrangements with alternative suppliers.
 Competition

 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We face potential competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies (such as the National Institutes of Health) and public and private research institutions. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have far greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 14

Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of proprietary and generic competition, and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or are more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in their establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Sickle Cell Disease
 
Endari® is approved as a therapy to reduce the acute complications of SCD in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. The other drugs which are indicated to reduce the frequency of sickle cell crisis are hydroxyurea (marketed as DROXIA or Hydrea by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and available in generic form), which is approved to reduce the frequency of painful crises and need for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell anemia for the treatment of adults with SCD; Voxelotor (marketed as Oxbryta™ by Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.) tablets for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older; and crizanlizumab (marketed as Adakveo® by Novartis International AG) intravenous infusion approved to reduce the frequency of VOCs in adult and pediatric patients ages 16 years and older with SCD. Several companies are also developing product candidates for chronic treatment in SCD. Several other companies are in clinical trials to investigate new mechanisms of action for the chronic treatment of SCD.
 
Endari® also faces potential competition from one-time therapies for treating patients with severe SCD, including LentiGlobin BB305, which is being developed by bluebird bio, Inc. to treat SCD by inserting a functional human beta-globin gene into a patient’s hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, ex vivo and then transplanting the modified HSCs into the patient’s bloodstream. Bluebird has indicated its plans to pursue an accelerated development and approval pathway for its gene therapy product in SCD. Others are seeking to develop one-time therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, gene therapy and gene editing, including gene editing using CRISPR. Attempts to develop a cure for SCD through gene therapy are in the early stages, but if these attempts were to succeed and receive regulatory approval, it could adversely affect the market for Endari®.
 
We are also aware of efforts to develop cures for SCD through approaches such as bone marrow. Although bone marrow transplant is currently available for SCD patients, its use is limited by the lack of availability of matched donors and by the risk of serious complications, including graft versus host disease and infection. 
 Endari® also may compete with non-prescription grade L-glutamine, which is widely available as a dietary supplement at substantially lower prices than Endari®. Dietary supplements may be marketed without FDA approval, are generally not reimbursed by payors and are not subject to the rigorous quality control standards required by regulatory authorities for prescription drug products. Also, unlike prescription drugs, manufacturers of dietary supplements may not make claims that the supplements will cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease, and we are not aware of any reports in peer-reviewed literature regarding the effectiveness of non-prescription grade L-glutamine supplements in treating SCD in controlled clinical trials.
 Oral Mucosa Epithelial Cell Sheet
 Currently, the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency (“LSCD”) patients varies based on the severity of the LSCD. Treatment may include the use of non-invasive procedures such as autologous serum drops, therapeutic scleral lens and corneal scraping to more invasive surgical procedures such as limbal stem cells or oral mucosal stem cells graft. The source of the transplanted tissue can be from cells from the patient’s healthy eye, matched living donors or cadavers. Transplantation with cells other than from the patient’s own tissue can cause serious complications, including graft-versus-host disease. Using oral mucosal epithelial cells (“OMEC”) of the LSCD patients lessens these risks. Specifically, the use of OMEC eliminates the risk of graft rejection, permits treatment of bilateral LSCD patients and allows engineered corneal epithelial cell sheets to be transplanted on LSCD patients’ corneas.
 The development of OMEC technology to treat LSCD is in the early stages. We are not aware of any FDA approved treatments using OMEC for LSCD. 
 Research institutions outside the United States (e.g., The Centre Hospitalier National d’Ophtalmologie des Quinze Vingts lin Paris, France; Royan Institute Teheran in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Hospital San Raffaele in Milan, Italy) 
 15

are researching the transplantation of corneal cells from patients’ healthy eyes to reverse LSCD. However, results from these clinical trials were not published yet. This approach only allows uni-lateral LSCD patients to be treated and risks damage to the patients’ one healthy corneas.
The use of OMEC is a promising alternative for treat LSCD. For example, the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in South Korea, the He Eye Hospital in China and the Adisak Wongkajornsilp, Siriraj Hospital in Thailand are conducting phase 2 clinical trials using the OMEC. While many research institutions as are conducting such trials, we are not aware of published results of these studies. 
 Our OMEC-based regenerative medicine technology eliminates risks associated with donor-dependent transplantation and has shown some promising results in pilot studies (animal serum dependent) done by other groups in Japan and Europe. Our novel and innovative cell sheet therapy utilizes xeno-free media that allows harvested cell sheets to retain intact basal membranes and extracellular matrix (fibronectin, laminin, collagen type IV), reducing the inherent risks of suturing during transplantation. Our cell sheet therapy also makes possible to layer different types of cell sheets by harvesting the cell sheet without the use of harmful enzymes (trypsin or dispase) that may damage the cell‑based therapy and potentially to construct in vitro stratified tissue equivalents by alternately layering different types of harvested cell sheets to provide regenerated tissue architectures, resembling human tissues. This technique holds promise for the study of cell‑cell communications and angiogenesis in reconstructed, three‑dimensional environments, as well as for tissues engineering with complex, multicellular architectures and drug-screening.
Government Regulation
 The FDA has granted Endari Orphan Drug designation and the EC has granted L-glutamine Orphan Medicinal designation for the treatment of SCD. 
 
Orphan Drug Designation. The FDA has authority under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act to grant Orphan Drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. This law defines a rare disease or condition generally as one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of the development and distribution of the orphan product in the United States will be recovered from sales of the product. Being granted Orphan Drug designation provides tax benefits to mitigate expenses of developing the orphan product. More importantly, Orphan Drug designation provides seven years of market exclusivity if the product receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it was granted such designation and the indication for which approval is granted matches the indication for which Orphan Drug designation was granted. During the seven-year exclusivity period, Orphan Drug exclusivity precludes FDA approval of a marketing application for the same product for the same indication. Orphan Drug exclusivity is limited and will not preclude the FDA from approving the same product for the same indication if the same product is shown to be clinically superior to the product previously granted exclusivity. For example, if the same product for the same indication is shown to have significantly fewer side effects, the FDA may approve the second product despite the Orphan Drug exclusivity granted to the first product. In addition, a product that is the same as the orphan product may receive approval for a different indication (whether orphan or not) during the exclusivity period of the orphan product. Also, Orphan Drug market exclusivity will not bar a different product intended to treat the same orphan disease or condition from obtaining its own Orphan Drug designation and Orphan Drug exclusivity.
 
Orphan Medicinal status in the EU has similar benefits, including a ten-year marketing exclusivity period following marketing authorization in the EU.
 
505(b)(2) Applications. Under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) , a person may submit a NDA for which one or more of the clinical studies relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant does not have a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the clinical studies were conducted. Instead, a 505(b)(2) applicant may rely on published literature containing the specific information (e.g., clinical trials, animal studies) necessary to obtain approval of the application. The 505(b)(2) applicant may also rely on the FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness of a drug previously approved by the FDA when the applicant does not own or otherwise have the right to access the data in that previously approved application. The 505(b)(2) pathway to marketing authorization thus allows an applicant to submit a NDA without having to conduct its own studies to obtain data that are already documented in published reports or previously submitted NDAs. In addition to relying on safety data from the Phase 2 and 3 studies of Endari® and our previously approved product, NutreStore, we intend to take advantage of the 505(b)(2) pathway to the extent published literature will further support any NDA for PGLG.

Regulation by United States and foreign governmental authorities is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and expected marketing of our product candidates and in our ongoing research and development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation will apply to us will vary depending on the nature of the product candidates we seek to develop.
 
Human therapeutic products, such as drugs, biologics and cell-based therapies, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other preapproval requirements of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various federal and state statutes and regulations govern and influence pre- and post-approval requirements related to research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution and record keeping of such products to ensure the safety and effectiveness for their intended uses. The process of obtaining marketing approval and ensuring post approval compliance with the FD&C Act for drugs and biologics (and applicable provisions of the Public Health Service Act for biologics), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other applicable federal and state statutes and regulations, requires substantial time and financial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, marketing approval could adversely affect the marketing of any of our product candidates, our ability to receive product revenues, and our liquidity and capital resources.
 
The manufacture of these products is subject to cGMP regulations. The FDA inspects manufacturing facilities for compliance with cGMP regulations before deciding whether to approve a product candidate for marketing. 
 
The steps required by the FDA before a new product, such as a drug, biologic or cell-based therapy, may be marketed in the United States include:
 
 
● | completion of preclinical studies (during this stage, the treatment is called a development candidate);


● | the submission to the FDA of a proposal for the design of a clinical trial program for studying in humans the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate. This submission is referred to as an IND. The FDA reviews the IND to ensure it adequately protects the safety and rights of trial participants and that the design of the studies is adequate to permit an evaluation of the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness. The IND becomes effective within thirty days after the FDA receives the IND, unless the FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations described in the IND are deficient and cannot begin;


● | the conduct of adequate and well controlled clinical trials, usually completed in three phases, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use;


● | the submission to the FDA of a marketing application, a NDA, if the product candidate is a drug, that provides data and other information to demonstrate the product is safe and effective for its intended use (“BLA”), if the product candidate is a biologic that provides data and other information to demonstrate that the product candidate is safe, pure, and potent; and


● | the review and approval of the NDA by the FDA before the product candidate may be distributed commercially as a product.

 
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product candidate before we can market it as a product, the manufacturing establishment from which we obtain it must be registered and is subject to periodic FDA post approval inspections to ensure continued compliance with cGMP requirements. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that any equipment, facilities, laboratories, procedures or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and the conditions of the product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of the manufacturing operations, recalls, the withdrawal of approval and debarment. Manufacturers must expend substantial time, money and effort in the area of production, quality assurance and quality control to ensure compliance with these standards.
 
Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of the safety of a product candidate and characterization of its formulation. Preclinical testing is subject to Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing results are submitted to the FDA as a part of an IND which must become effective prior to commencement of clinical trials. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases following submission of an IND. In Phase 1, the product candidate under investigation (and therefore often called an investigational product) is initially administered to a small group of humans, either patients or healthy volunteers, primarily to test for safety (e.g., to identify any adverse effects), dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, a slightly larger sample of patients who have the condition or disease for which the investigational product is being 
 17

studied receive the investigational product to assess the effectiveness of the investigational product, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects. If the data show the investigational product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population, Phase 3 studies, also referred to as pivotal studies or enabling studies, are initiated to further establish clinical safety and provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the investigational product in a broader sample of the general patient population, to determine the overall risk benefit ratio of the investigational product, and provide an adequate basis for physician and patient labeling. During all clinical studies, Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) standards and applicable human subject protection requirements must be followed. The results of the research and product development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, clinical studies, and related information are submitted in a NDA to the FDA.
 
The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining FDA approval for a new therapeutic product, such as a drug, biologic or cell-based product, is likely to take years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. If a NDA is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will file, review, and approve it. Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, post market studies could be required to provide additional data on safety or effectiveness. Additional pivotal studies would be required to support adding other indications to the labeling. Also, the FDA will require post market reporting and could require specific surveillance or risk mitigation programs to monitor for known and unknown side effects of the product. Results of post marketing programs could limit or expand the continued marketing of the product. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling, or the location of the manufacturing facility, a NDA supplement would generally be required to be submitted to the FDA prior to or corresponding with that change, or for minor changes in the periodic safety update report that must be submitted annually to the FDA.
 
The rate of completion of any clinical trial depends upon, among other factors, sufficient patient enrollment and retention. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial, the number of clinical sites, the availability of alternative therapies, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial. Delays in planned patient enrollment might result in increased costs and delays. Patient retention could be affected by patient noncompliance, adverse events, or any change in circumstances making the patient no longer eligible to remain in the trial.
 
Failure to adhere to regulatory requirements for the protection of human subjects, to ensure the integrity of data, other IND requirements, and GCP standards in conducting clinical trials could cause the FDA to place a “clinical hold” on one or more studies of a product candidate, which would stop the studies and delay or preclude further data collection necessary for product approval. Noncompliance with GCP standards would also have a negative impact on the FDA’s evaluation of a NDA. If at any time the FDA finds that a serious question regarding data integrity has been raised due to the appearance of a wrongful act, such as fraud, bribery or gross negligence, the FDA may invoke its Application Integrity Policy (“AIP”) under which it could immediately suspend review of any pending NDA or refuse to accept the submission of a NDA as filed, require the sponsor to validate data, require additional clinical studies, disapprove a pending NDA or withdraw approval of marketed products, as well as require corrective and preventive action to ensure data integrity in future submissions. Significant noncompliance with IND regulations could result in the FDA not only refusing to accept a NDA as filed but could also result in enforcement actions, including civil and administrative actions, civil money penalties, criminal prosecution, criminal fines and debarment. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries.
 
The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval might be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for some European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements.
 
In most cases, if the FDA has not approved a product candidate for sale in the United States, the unapproved product may be exported to any country in the world for clinical trial or sale if it meets U.S. export requirements and has marketing authorization in any listed country without submitting an export request to the FDA or receiving FDA approval to export the product, as long as the product meets the regulatory requirements of the country to which the product is being exported. Listed countries include each member nation in the European Union or the European Economic Area, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, Switzerland and South Africa. If an unapproved product is not approved in one of the listed countries, the unapproved product may be exported directly to an unlisted country if the product meets the requirements of the regulatory authority of that country, and the FDA determines that the foreign country has statutory or regulatory requirements similar or equivalent to the United States.
 
In addition to the regulatory framework for product approvals, we and our collaborative partners must comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, the use, handling and 
 18

disposition of radioactive materials, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, and other local, state, federal and foreign regulation. All facilities and manufacturing processes used by third parties to produce our product candidates for clinical use in the United States and our products for commercialization must be in compliance with cGMP requirements and are subject to periodic regulatory inspections. The failure of third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could extend, delay or cause the termination of clinical trials conducted for our product candidates or the withdrawal of our products from the market. The impact of government regulation upon us cannot be predicted and could be material and adverse. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action.
 Patents, Proprietary Rights and Know‑How
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and otherwise preserve the intellectual property rights relating to the design, operation, sale and distribution of our products. We intend to seek patents on our products when we deem it commercially appropriate. The process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive, and there can be no assurance that patents will be issued for currently pending or future applications or that our existing patents or any new patents issued will be of sufficient scope or strength or provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to, or may initiate, litigation or patent office interference proceedings, which may require significant financial and management resources. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or the advent of litigation arising out of any such intellectual property claims could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
We have relied to date on a combination of patent licenses, trademark rights, trade secret protection, distribution agreements, manufacturing agreements, manufacturing capability and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights. While we do not currently own any issued patents directed to the treatment of sickle cell anemia, we do own patent applications in that area, as well as issued patents and patent applications directed to the treatment of diverticulosis, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. We furthermore have Orphan Drug market exclusivity for the treatment of sickle cell anemia with Endari® in the United States (through July 7, 2024) and in the EU (ten years from the approval date, if approved).
 
We also rely on employee agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our products. We require that our officers and key employees enter into confidentiality agreements that require these officers and employees to assign to us the rights to any inventions developed by them during their employment with us. All the confidentiality agreements include non-solicitation provisions that remain effective during the course of employment and for periods following termination of employment.
 Patents
 
We have issued patents related to compositions including PGLG and methods involving administration of PGLG for the treatment of diverticulosis in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, India, Mexico, China, Indonesia, Korea and Russia. A patent application related to the same subject matter has been allowed in the United States, and associated patent applications are currently pending in the United States, the EU, Brazil, India, Korea and Russia.
 
Patent directed to compositions for decreasing HbA1C levels in individuals who are shown to have average blood sugar levels in the diabetic range has issued in Japan and Indonesia; a related Philippines patent application has been allowed. Associated applications are currently pending in the United States, Europe, Brazil, India, China and Indonesia.
 
The company has issued patents directed to the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in Japan and the Philippines.  A corresponding European patent application has been allowed. Associated applications are pending in the United States, Europe, Brazil, India, China and Indonesia.
 
A patent application directed to the treatment of sickle cell using a multi-component composition is pending in the United States and Europe. An international application directed to the same invention has been filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
 HbA1C levels are one of the best indicators of whether diabetics and prediabetics have blood sugar levels under control, through therapeutic application of L-glutamine. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces. People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health problems including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and blindness. Japan has more than 7 million diagnosed cases of diabetes, which represents about 7.6% of Japanese between the ages of 20 and 79. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are an estimated 29 million 
 19

Americans living with diabetes and an estimated 86 million Americans with prediabetes, a serious health condition that can increase a person’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
 Licenses and Promotional Rights Agreements
 In June 2016, we entered into a non‑exclusive agreement with CellSeed and Dr. Kohji Nishida for the development of CAOMECS technology. Under this agreement, upon commercialization we are required to pay royalties based upon net sales.
Trademarks
 We currently own U.S. trademark registrations for “Emmaus Medical” and “Endari” and were recently granted a trademark registration for “Xyndari™” (as Endari® will be marketed if approved) in the EU. This Annual Report also contains trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners. Solely for convenience, these trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights may appear without the® or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate that we do not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to the same.
Employees
 As of January 5, 2021, we had 55 employees, 53 of whom were full time. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on March 20, 1987 under the name Age Research, Inc.
