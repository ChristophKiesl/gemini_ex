ITEM 1 - BUSINESS.

Corporate History/Overview

Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. (TSI or the Company) was organized August 6, 2007 under the name Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc., under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first quarter of 2011 the Company changed its name from Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc. to Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., and acquired Splint Decisions, Inc., a California corporation.

Currently the Company is focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) ones immune system.

Activating ones immune system is now an accepted method to treat certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections and to prevent illness. Additionally, inhibiting ones immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders and allergic reactions.

TSI plans to develop a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, improve maternal and fetal health, fight periodontal disease, and for daily health. 

Nutraceutical Division  TSI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its flagship product, ProJuvenol®, is a proprietary mixture containing pterostilbene  one of the most potent antioxidants known. TSI filed a patent application for ProJuvenol® on 07-08-2015 titled: Augmentation of Oncology Immunotherapies by Pterostilbene Containing Compositions. In addition we recently introduced a line of oncologist friendly nutraceuticals in liposome formula. These include CoQ10, Curcumin, Glutathione, and Vitamin-C in 16oz bottles.

OmniBiome, Inc., (Omni) - is a majority-owned subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 20, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and June 7, 2017, TSI owns approximately 73.75% of the outstanding shares of OmniBiome. OMNI intends to focus on the use of probiotics to prevent pre-term labor and on using probiotics to reverse periodontal disease. Mr. Dixon and Mr. Berg, of the Company, are also officers and Directors of OMNI. As of June 7, 2017 formal operations have not commenced.

Emvolio, Inc. (EMVO)  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 03, 2016. EMVO intends to focus on developing products that can be used together to attack cancer as different levels, as well as be used alone or in combination with existing therapies. Mr. Dixon and Mr. Berg, and Dr. Ichim, of the Company, are also officers and officers and/or directors of EMVO. As of June 7, 2017, formal operations have not commenced.
SandBox Dental Labs, Inc.  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the state of Delaware on December 2, 2016, consisting of a dental laboratory to manufacture and fill prescriptions from dentists who will use our proprietary Sleep Appliance to treat their patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. As of June 7, 2017, formal operations have not commenced.

TSI has experienced recurring losses over the past years which have resulted in accumulated deficits of approximately $4.3 million and a working capital deficit of approximately $612 thousand at December 31, 2016. These conditions raise significant doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to secure additional financing, increase sales of its products and attain profitable operations. It is the intent of management to continue to raise additional capital. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure such additional funds or obtain such on terms satisfactory to the Company, if at all. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Nutraceutical Division  TSI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its flagship product, ProJuvenol®, is a proprietary mixture containing pterostilbene  one of the most potent antioxidants known. TSOI filed a patent application for ProJuvenol® on 07-08-2015 titled: Augmentation of Oncology Immunotherapies by Pterostilbene Containing Compositions. On April 28, 2016 the Company announced the filing of a patent application covering the use of ProJuvenol© and its active ingredient pterostilbene for augmentation of stem cell activity. In addition we recently launched 4 new products in Liposomal formulation. They are CoQ10, Curcumin, Glutathione, and Vitamin-C in 16oz bottles.

OmniBiome, Inc., (OMNI) - is a majority-owned subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 20, 2015, where the intellectual property surrounding probiotics is housed.

Emvolio, Inc., (EMVO)  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSI, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 03, 2016, where the intellectual property surrounding immune-oncology is housed. 

Nutraceutical Division (TSOI)

ProJuvenol® is a powerful synergistic blend of complex anti-aging ingredients inspired by nature to help promote cellular rejuvenation and healthy functionality for everyday living, based upon pterostilbene, one of nature's unique and intelligent antioxidants/anti-inflammatories. ProJuvenol includes a scientifically valid blend of interactive ingredients with anti-aging and cellular protective properties to help support optimal health and provide the benefits of mental alertness and physical well-being.

Pterostilbene (pronounced "tero-STILL-bean") has created a buzz in the world of nutrition research. Scientists discovered this powerful antioxidant several decades ago and have since found that it rivals its cousin resveratrol's multi-functional abilities, and may actually exceed its anti-aging and health promoting potential. Found naturally in blueberries, pterostilbene has been shown in emerging experimental studies to exhibit up to 7 times greater bioavailability than resveratrol as well as better metabolic stability. This translates to potentially higher levels of pterostilbene in the blood upon ingestion, and longer lasting effects in the body compared to resveratrol. More simply put, it remains active in your body for a much greater period of time and during this enhanced bio-available period your body has the opportunity to allow it to utilize this powerful antioxidant molecule.

A large body of experimental research has now documented a wide range of potential health effects associated with pterostilbene. In fact, the more researchers study pterostilbene, the greater its human health potential becomes. In addition to being a powerful antioxidant, emerging experimental research suggests this plant compound may also help regulate cell growth, promote fat metabolism, support glucose utilization, influence brain function, and improve the body's natural detoxification enzymes that are required to help protect cells against potentially damaging compounds from the environment.

Patents:

TSOI filed a patent covering the use of its ProJuvenol® product, as well as various pterostilbene compositions, for use in augmenting efficacy of existing immuno-oncology drugs that are currently on the market. The patent is based on the ability of pterostilbene, one of the major ingredients of ProJuvenol®, to reduce oxidative stress produced by cancer cells, which in turn protects the immune system from cancer mediated immune suppression.
  Immuno-Oncology, described by Science Magazine as 'Breakthrough of the Year' offers the possibility of not only killing tumor cells in a non-toxic manner, but also establishing immunological memory, which patrols the body and destroys recurrent tumor cells. While great progress has been made in developing drugs that stimulate the immune system to recognize and kill tumors, a major pitfall of current approaches is that tumors produce chemicals and oxidative stress that suppresses the immune system, thus limiting efficacy of immune therapies.

Pterostilbene, which is chemically related to resveratrol, has been published to possess anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Through the filing of the recent patent, the company is exploring whether its lead product, ProJuvenol®, may be useful as a nutraceutical adjuvant to conventional cancer immunotherapies. 

The importance of proper nutrition in the context of immunotherapy cannot be overstated. Studies on one of the original cancer immunotherapies, interleukin-2, demonstrated that efficacy was related to anti-oxidant content in the patients at time of therapy. Accordingly, we are seeking through the current work to identify whether our currently marketed product, ProJuvenol®, may be utilized as part of an integrative approach to building up the immune response of cancer patients.

In addition, on April 28, 2016 the Company filed a patent application covering the use of ProJuvenol© and its active ingredient pterostilbene for augmentation of stem cell activity. Diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by deficient stem cell activity. The patent covers the stimulation of stem cells that already exist in the patients body, as well as stem cells that are administered therapeutically.

Studies have shown that patients who have higher levels of endogenous stem cell activity have reduced cardiovascular disease risk and undergo accelerated neurological recovery after stroke as compared to patients with lower numbers of such stem cells.

TSOI markets currently several other nutraceuticals, they include T-Rx®, a testosterone booster, and Vital® Female an estrogen enhancer, Liposomal CoQ10, Curcumin, and Vitamin-C, all powerful antioxidants. 


ProJuvenol® - Is a powerful synergistic blend of complex anti-aging ingredients inspired by nature to help promote cellular rejuvenation and healthy functionality for everyday living. Based upon one of nature's unique and intelligent anti- oxidants/anti-inflammatories. 
T-Rx® - Is specifically designed just for men and is formulated to assist in increasing testosterone levels and keeping them high. The result is a significant increase in testosterone levels, which assist in adding lean muscle mass, bone density, increased energy and the reduction of fat. 
VITAL® - Is specifically formulated for women and is designed to increase energy, increase bone density, reduce fat and improve muscle tone. Additionally this supplement will also optimize hormone levels, increase libido, and decrease symptoms of stress and anxiety. 
Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a substance similar to a vitamin. It is found in every cell of the body. Your body makes CoQ10, and your cells use it to produce energy your body needs for cell growth and maintenance. It also functions as an antioxidant, which protects the body from damage caused by harmful molecules. 
Curcumin is an anti-inflammatory molecule in the turmeric root, a relative of ginger. The properties of curcumin can best be summarized as protective of the integrity of bio molecules in the body by being both a fabulous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory all rolled up in one. 
Glutathione is one of the most powerful antioxidants that the body produces and is used to bind and remove toxins, including heavy metals such as mercury and lead from the body. Levels may drop as result of oxidative stress due to disease, drugs, aging, toxic chemicals, inflammation and stress. Adequate levels of glutathione are necessary to provide important antioxidant protection.
Vitamin-C is absorbed at approximately 19%, the balance remains in the gastrointestinal tract to attract water and loosen the bowels. Liposomalized vitamin C is absorbed much more efficiently than traditional delivery methods. A huge advance in both efficiency and effectiveness of supplemental nutrients. 

  On June 22, 2016 the Company announced the addition of four new consumer products to our nutraceutical division.

The four new products are all be in Liposome formulas. Many orally consumed nutrients are absorbed from 4% to 19%! Those same nutrients in a Liposomal Delivery System are absorbed at a much higher level in the bloodstream. Liposomes have layers that can encapsulate an ingredient and serve to protect the ingredient from the environment as well as act as a slow release mechanism. A liposome is a microscopic, fluid-filled pouch whose walls are made of layers of phospholipids identical in makeup to the phospholipids that make up cell membranes.

Liposomes represent a versatile and advanced nanodelivery system for a wide range of biologically active compounds. Liposomes have been used to improve the therapeutic index of new or established ingredients by modifying their absorption, reducing metabolism, and prolonging biological half-life.

Liposomes can be used to deliver substances to the blood stream and even target cells much more efficiently than normal. The liposomes offer a unique delivery system for nutrients because these microscopic spheres are so tiny that absorption becomes almost perfect.

The four new high absorption formulas are Liposomal Vitamin-C, CoQ10, Curcumin, and Glutathione, sold in 16oz bottles.
