Business.

Overview

PayMeOn, Inc. (Paymeon), a Nevada corporation, is a company organized on May 30, 2006. Paymeon conducts business through three separate wholly-owned subsidiaries: HLM Paymeon, Inc., Paymeon Brands, Inc., and since February 2017 Rockstar Acquisitions, LLC (dba Basalt America). 

Historically, Paymeon owned and operated products aimed at monetizing consumer influence through social, local and mobile marketing. 

On July 18, 2014, PayMeOn acquired a 19.4% stake in Prodeco Technologies, LLC, a USA-based researcher, developer, marketer, and manufacturer of quality electric bicycles and entered the business of selling light electric vehicles and related products through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HLM Paymeon, Inc. In September 2014, HLM Paymeon began selling ProdecoTech electric bicycles online through its website www.irideelectric.com, under a non-exclusive dealer agreement. 

In October 2015, HLM Paymeon launched a retail store located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to sell ProdecoTech and other electric bicycles, as well as other alternative transportation products (such as hoverboards) and related products and accessories at our retail location. Effective November 18, 2016, the Company assigned all of its interests in Prodeco Technologies, LLC, held by Ebike, LLC and A Better Bike, LLC to Tavone Family Holdings, LLC in consideration of a total cash payment of $30,000 pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated November 18, 2016. The Company owned its Prodeco Technologies LLC interests through its 100% ownership of Ebike, LLC and A Better Bike, LLC. The Company sold its interests as part of its changing focus. While the Company intends to maintain its light electric vehicles business, it is shifting its primary focus to its Basalt America business. 

In March 2016, we formed Paymeon Brands, Inc to develop, market, manage and monetize lifestyle brands and products. It is our intention to acquire exclusive licensing rights to brands which we believe are expandable to additional product lines. In addition, Paymeon Brands may seek to develop or acquire its own products, which are not yet known brands, but that it believes are in substantial growth markets and can become lifestyle oriented brands. 

On December 23, 2016, a third-party driver drove his car through our retail storefront located at 2599 North Federal Highway, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33305. The accident caused serious damage to the building and seriously impacted our ability to sell to and service customers. Despite being in the process of reducing our focus on our light electric vehicles business, we are still conducting sales. The damaged storefront has substantially diminished sales volumes we expected to generate during the first quarter of 2017. While there can be no assurances that we will receive a settlement, we believe the driver was insured and are pursuing a claim for compensation for lost sales. 

In February 2017 subsequent to our fiscal year end, we acquired 100% of the membership interests of Rockstar Acquisitions, LLC (dba Basalt America). Basalt America leverages its licensed intellectual property, technology and processes to produce Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer products that are used as replacements for steel products that reinforce concrete such as rebar. Basalt America is the exclusive licensee under a license agreement with Global Energy Sciences for its concrete reinforcement products known as RockRebar®, RockStirrups®, RockMesh®, and RockStaples. The license provides Basalt America with exclusivity for the United States, (excluding California and Hawaii), the Caribbean (excluding Cuba), and Peru. It also provides that Basalt America shall have a right of first refusal for all other territories in the world.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for Paymeon, Inc. on a consolidated basis were $394,219 and were derived from the sale of electric bicycles made by multiple manufacturers, service, and lifestyle apparel.

Light Electric Vehicle Sales
 Since acquiring our interest in ProdecoTech Technologies, LLC in 2014, we have been primarily engaged in the sale of electric bicycles, hoverboards and other related products and accessories, both online and at our retail location located at 2599 North Federal Highway, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. During 2014, 2015, and 2016, sales related to our light electric vehicles business constituted the majority of our sales. Our future focus will be on developing Basalt America, which we acquired in February of 2017.
Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer products
 We acquired Rockstar Acquisitions, LLC. d/b/a Basalt America in February, 2017 to capitalize on the introduction of new technology and products towards the rebuilding of global infrastructure, especially as it applies to products that reinforce concrete. Rockstar Acquisitions, LLC. d/b/a Basalt America leverages its licensed intellectual property, technology and processes to produce Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer products that are used as replacements for steel products that reinforce concrete such as rebar. Basalt America is the exclusive licensee under a license agreement with Global Energy Sciences for its concrete reinforcement products known as RockRebar®, RockStirrups®, RockMesh®, and RockStaples. Basalt Americas products often represent substantial improvements in strength and resistance relative to existing steel industry products. Our products will be produced in Oakland Park, Florida. We intend to sell our products primarily to government and commercial construction contractors, and home builders.
Social Income®

Through our Paymeon Brands, Inc. subsidiary we intend to capitalize on our Social Income® trademark by creating opportunities to monetize the substantial influence consumers exert through their networks. We are dedicated to growing and leveraging our own social media following, as well as extending our social media reach through partnerships with well-known influencers. We intend to aggregate social audiences across platforms to form a substantial network of potential buyers/influencers for our products. We will use our network to instantly garner feedback for new product launches, as well as direct-sell many types of products. We also intend to use our network to continuously promote the lifestyle aspects of our brands, resulting in even more promotion by our audience to others outside of our audience. 

We expect that our Social Income® based products will be available both over the web and through mobile devices. The primary aim of the products will be to allow consumers and merchants to browse, offer, and promote products and services, and most importantly, share them in exchange for social income®payments (which may be in the form of cash, points, additional savings, etc.).

Social income® is a registered trademark of PayMeOn. We define social income® as income or benefits derived from referring or recommending products or services to people in your network(s). The fundamental driver of PayMeOns products is the opportunity for users to earn rewards through their referrals. Many products and services are sold over the Internet today through recommendations or referrals. Social networks have allowed users to connect seamlessly and have become powerful platforms for friends, family and colleagues to connect, share, and recommend products that are imbedded in the networking experience. We believe that users should be rewarded for their successful referrals. We call these rewards social income®. We believe that the ubiquitous adoption of mobile phones has created portable and real time social networks that can be monetized.

Competition
 The Social and lifestyle -based marketing industry is a new, fragmented and competitive industry. Furthermore, the marketing industry in general is a large and competitive. In the United States and throughout the world, the marketing industry has a diverse set of channels, including direct mail, tele-marketing, television, radio, newspaper, magazines and the recently developed mobile and web-based markets. The list of market leaders fluctuates constantly. Many competitors are large and have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than our company.

The light electric vehicle retail market, which includes electric bicycles and hover boards, is new and evolving in the United States. We compete with large, established marketers of light electric vehicles and traditional bicycles and similar products. We also complete with online retailers, such as Amazon.com. In addition, we also compete with lesser-known distributors of electric bicycles and other products sourced primarily outside of the United States. As described above, we are shifting our focus to our Basalt America business. 

The concrete reinforcement industry is well-established around the world and includes some of the largest steel companies in the world. While we believe that our products are unique and create a new segment within the concrete reinforcement industry, we still expect to compete with these large companies, both inside and outside of the United States, as they aggressively market their existing products.

Intellectual Property

The term social income® is a registered trademark of PayMeOn, Inc. Additionally, we have applied for registration of various trademarks related to Rockstar Acquisitions, LLC. d/b/a Basalt America. We have not applied for any other U.S. trademarks and, except for common law rights, we currently do not hold any other intellectual property rights on the products we have developed.

As part of Rockstar Acquisitions, LLC. d/b/a Basalt Americas license with Global Energy Sciences, we have acquired rights to use the trademarks RockRebar®, RockStirrups®, RockMesh®, and RockStaples.

Governmental Regulation

Our potential mobile and e-commerce products are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, subscriber privacy, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the internet or e-commerce. In addition, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our websites or may even attempt to completely block access to our websites. Accordingly, adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business. The CARD Act, as well as the laws of most states, contain provisions governing product terms and conditions of gift cards, gift certificates, stored value or pre-paid cards or coupons (gift cards), such as provisions prohibiting or limiting the use of expiration dates on gift cards or the amount of fees charged in connection with gift cards or requiring specific disclosures on or in connection with gift cards. PayMeOn coupon, gift card, stored value or prepaid card offers generally are included within the definition of gift cards in many of these laws. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions have laws that govern disclosure and certain product terms and conditions, including restrictions on expiration dates and fees that may apply to PayMeOn offers. However, the CARD Act as well as a number of states and certain foreign jurisdictions also have exemptions from the operation of these provisions or otherwise modify the application of these provisions applicable to gift cards that are issued as part of a promotion or promotional program. If PayMeOn offers are subject to the CARD Act, and are not included in the exemption for promotional programs, it is possible that the purchase value, which is the amount equal to the price paid for the offer, or the promotional value, which is the add-on value of the offer in excess of the price paid, or both, may not expire before the later of (i) five years after the date on which the offer was issued or the date on which the customer last loaded funds on the offer if the offer has a reloadable feature; (ii) the offers stated expiration date (if any), unless offers come within an exemption in the CARD Act for promotional programs; or (iii) a later date provided by applicable state law. In addition, regardless of whether an exemption for PayMeOn offers applies under the CARD Act, in those states that prohibit or otherwise restrict expiration dates on gift cards that are defined to include offers and that do not have exemptions that apply to the purchase value or the promotional value, or both, of offers, PayMeOn offers may be required to be honored for the full offer value (the total of purchase value and promotional value) until redeemed. There can be no assurance that as PayMeOn incorporates new requirements as detailed under the CARD Act that merchants will continue to offer PayMeOn offers.

Products sold by Basalt America are subject to various approvals and certifications from various private and public entities, such as the Department of Transportation and the US Army Corps of Engineers.

Rockstars approximate total obligation was approximately $3 million. On February 21, 2017, Paymeon completed its acquisition of Rockstar.
