Item 1.  Business
General
Valaris plc is a global offshore contract drilling company. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Valaris," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Valaris plc together with all its subsidiaries and predecessors.
We are a leading provider of offshore contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry. We currently own an offshore drilling rig fleet of 61 rigs, with drilling operations in almost every major offshore market across five continents. Our rig fleet includes 11 drillships, four dynamically positioned semisubmersible rigs, one moored semisubmersible rig, 45 jackup rigs and a 50% equity interest in Saudi Aramco Rowan Offshore Drilling Company ("ARO"), our 50/50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco, which owns an additional seven rigs. We operate the world's largest fleet amongst competitive rigs, including one of the newest ultra-deepwater fleets in the industry and a leading premium jackup fleet. 
Our customers include many of the leading national and international oil companies, in addition to many independent operators. We are among the most geographically diverse offshore drilling companies, with current operations spanning nine countries on five continents. The markets in which we operate include the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, the Middle East, West Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia.
We provide drilling services on a day rate contract basis. Under day rate contracts, we provide an integrated service that includes the provision of a drilling rig and rig crews for which we receive a daily rate that may vary between the full rate and zero rate throughout the duration of the contractual term, depending on the operations of the rig. We also may receive lump-sum fees or similar compensation for the mobilization, demobilization and capital upgrades of our rigs. Our customers bear substantially all of the costs of constructing the well and supporting drilling operations, as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the well.
Following several years of market volatility beginning with oil price declines in 2014, as we entered 2020, we expected that volatility to continue over the near-term with the expectation that long-term oil prices would remain at levels sufficient to support a continued gradual recovery in the demand for offshore drilling services. We were focused on opportunities to put our rigs to work, manage liquidity, extend our financial runway, and reduce debt as we sought to navigate the extended market downturn and improve our balance sheet. Recognizing our ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet our financial obligations depended upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control, we had significant financial flexibility within our capital structure to support our liability management efforts. However, starting in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto negatively impacted the macro-economic environment and global economy. Global oil demand fell sharply at the same time global oil supply increased as a result of certain oil producers competing for market share, leading to a supply glut. As a consequence, the price of Brent crude oil fell from around $60 per barrel at year-end 2019 to around $20 per barrel in mid-April 2020. In response to dramatically reduced oil price expectations for the near term, our customers reviewed, and in most cases lowered significantly, their capital expenditure plans in light of revised pricing expectations. This caused our customers to cancel or shorten the duration of many of our 2020 drilling contracts, cancel future drilling programs and seek pricing and other contract concessions which led to material operating losses and liquidity constraints for us. While there has been some recent improvement to Brent crude oil prices, to approximately $65 per barrel in February 2021, there is still a significant amount of uncertainty around the sustainability of the improvement in oil prices to support a recovery in demand for offshore drilling services.
Additionally, the full impact that the pandemic and the decline in oil prices will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows is uncertain due to numerous factors, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of the ongoing vaccine rollout, the duration of the oil price and 
demand decline, and the extent of disruptions to our operations. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in only limited operational downtime. Our rigs have had to shut down operations while crews are tested and incremental sanitation protocols are implemented and while crew changes have been restricted as replacement crews are quarantined. We continue to incur additional personnel, housing and logistics costs in order to mitigate the potential impacts of COVID-19 to our operations. In limited instances, we have been reimbursed for these costs by our customers. Our operations and business may be subject to further economic disruptions as a result of the spread of COVID-19 among our workforce, the extension or imposition of further public health measures affecting supply chain and logistics, and the impact of the pandemic on key customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. There can be no assurance that these, or other issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, will not materially affect our ability to operate our rigs in the future. 
We expect that these challenges will continue for drilling contractors as customers wait to gain additional clarity on commodity pricing and seek to reduce costs in the near-term by attempting to renegotiate existing contract terms. We believe the current market and macro-economic conditions will create a challenging contracting environment through 2021 and into 2022 and potentially beyond.
The combined effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the significant decline in the demand for oil and the substantial surplus in the supply of oil have resulted in significantly reduced demand and day rates for offshore drilling provided by the Company and increased uncertainty regarding long-term market conditions. These recent events have had a significant adverse impact on our current and expected liquidity position and financial runway and led to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases (as defined herein).
While we have and are continuing to pursue a variety of cost-cutting measures such as further reductions in corporate overhead and discretionary expenditures, reductions in capital expenditures and an increased focus on operational efficiencies, we determined that based on our significant level of indebtedness and the circumstances described above that a comprehensive restructuring of our indebtedness was needed to improve our financial position. As more fully described in “Note 2 – Chapter 11 Proceedings and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", the Company will undergo a financial restructuring that is intended to reduce debt levels substantially, support continued operations during the current lower demand environment and provide a robust financial platform to take advantage of market recovery over the long-term.
Chapter 11 Proceedings and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
On August 19, 2020 (the “Petition Date”), Valaris plc and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, “the Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Bankruptcy Code”) in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). As part of the chapter 11 cases under the caption In re Valaris plc, et al., Case No. 20-34114 (MI) (the “Chapter 11 Cases”), the Debtors were granted “first-day” relief which enabled the Company to continue operating without interruption or disruption to its relationships with its customers and vendors or its high-quality service delivery. In particular, employee pay and benefits are expected to continue without interruption.
On August 18, 2020, the Debtors entered into the Restructuring Support Agreement (the "Original RSA") with certain senior note holders (collectively, the "Consenting Noteholders"). On February 5, 2021, the Debtors entered into the Amended Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Amended RSA”) with the Consenting Noteholders and certain revolving credit facility lenders (the “Consenting Lenders” and, together with the Consenting Noteholders, the “Consenting Creditors”), which contemplates that the Company will implement the restructuring through the Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to a plan of reorganization and the various related transactions set forth in or contemplated by the Amended RSA. Holders of approximately 100% of the total commitments outstanding under our revolving credit facility and holders of approximately 72% of the aggregate amount of our Senior Notes outstanding are party to the Amended RSA.
See “Note 2 – Chapter 11 Proceedings and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional details regarding the Chapter 11 Cases and related items, the Amended RSA and our ability to continue as a going concern.
Contract Drilling Operations
Our business consists of four operating segments: (1) Floaters, which included our drillships and semisubmersible rigs, (2) Jackups, (3) ARO and (4) Other, which consists of management services on rigs owned by third-parties and the activities associated with our arrangements with ARO under the Rig Lease Agreements, the Secondment Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement. Floaters, Jackups and ARO are also reportable segments.
We own and operate 61 rigs, 27 are located in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, 11 are located in North and South America and 23 are located in Europe as of December 31, 2020.
Our drilling rigs drill and complete oil and natural gas wells. From time to time, our drilling rigs may be utilized as accommodation units or for non-drilling services, such as workovers and interventions, plug and abandonment and decommissioning work. Demand for our drilling services is based upon many factors beyond our control. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - The success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which can be significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.”
Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiations with our customers, and most contracts are awarded upon competitive bidding. The terms of our drilling contracts can vary significantly, but generally contain the following commercial terms:
•contract duration or term for a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill one or more wells, 
•term extension options, exercisable by our customers, upon advance notice to us, at mutually agreed, indexed, fixed rates or current rate at the date of extension, 
•provisions permitting early termination of the contract (1) if the rig is lost or destroyed, (2) if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to various events, including damage or breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, or "force majeure" events or (3) at the convenience (without cause) of the customer (in certain cases obligating the customer to pay us an early termination fee providing some level of compensation to us for the remaining term),
•payment of compensation to us is (generally in U.S. dollars although some contracts require a portion of the compensation to be paid in local currency) on a day rate basis such that we receive a fixed amount for each day that the drilling rig is under contract (lower day rates generally apply for limited periods when operations are suspended due to various events, including during delays that are beyond our reasonable control, during repair of equipment damage or breakdown and during periods of re-drilling damaged portions of the well, and no day rate, or zero rate, generally applies when these limited periods are exceeded until the event is remediated, and during periods to remediate unsatisfactory performance or other specified conditions), 
•payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling rig, including crew labor and incidental rig supply and maintenance costs, 
•mobilization and demobilization requirements of us to move the drilling rig to and from the planned drilling site, and may include reimbursement of a portion of these moving costs by the customer in the form of an up-front payment, additional day rate over the contract term or direct reimbursement, and
•provisions allowing us to recover certain labor and other operating cost increases, including certain cost increases due to changes in applicable law, from our customers through day rate adjustment or direct reimbursement.    
In general, following the downturn in offshore drilling demand commencing in 2014, contract awards have been subject to an extremely competitive bidding process. The intense pressure on operating day rates has resulted in lower margin contracts that also contain less favorable contractual and commercial terms, including reduced or no mobilization and/or demobilization fees; reduced day rates or zero day rates during downtime due to damage or failure of our equipment; reduced standby, redrill and moving rates and reduced periods in which such rates are payable; reduced caps on reimbursements for lost or damaged downhole tools; reduced periods to remediate downtime due to equipment breakdowns or failure to perform in accordance with the contractual standards of performance before the operator may terminate the contract; certain limitations on our ability to be indemnified from operator and third party damages caused by our fault, resulting in increases in the nature and amounts of liability allocated to us; and reduced or no early termination fees and/or termination notice periods.
Backlog Information
Our contract drilling backlog reflects commitments, represented by signed drilling contracts, and is calculated by multiplying the contracted day rate by the contract period. The contracted day rate excludes certain types of lump sum fees for rig mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, as well as customer reimbursables and bonus opportunities. Contract backlog is adjusted for drilling contracts signed or terminated after each respective balance sheet date but prior to filing each of our annual reports on Form 10-K on March 2, 2021 and February 21, 2020, respectively. Our backlog excludes ARO's backlog, but includes backlog from our rigs leased to ARO at the contractual rates, which are subject to adjustment by the shareholder agreement. See "Note 5 - Equity Method Investment in ARO" to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
The following table summarizes our contract backlog of business as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):

 | 2020 | | 2019
Floaters | $ | 205.7 | | | $ | 847.3 
Jackups | 859.5 | | | 1,281.2 | 
Other(1) | 140.1 | | | 324.3 | 
Total | $ | 1,205.3 | | | $ | 2,452.8

(1)Other includes the bareboat charter backlog for the nine jackup rigs leased to ARO to fulfill contracts between ARO and Saudi Aramco, in addition to backlog for our managed rig services. Substantially all the operating costs for jackups leased to ARO through the bareboat charter agreements will be borne by ARO.
As of December 31, 2020, our backlog was $1.2 billion as compared to $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our floater backlog declined $641.6 million and our jackup backlog declined $421.7 million. Changes resulted from revenues realized during the period, contract terminations and contract suspensions, partially offset by new contract awards and contract extensions. Our other segment backlog declined $184.2 million due to contract concessions and revenues realized during the period.

The following table summarizes our contract backlog of business as of December 31, 2020 and the periods in which such revenues are expected to be realized (in millions):

 | 2021 | | 2022 | | 2023 | | 2024and Beyond | Total
Floaters | $ | 205.7 | | | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 205.7

(1)Includes the bareboat charter backlog for the nine jackup rigs leased to ARO to fulfill contracts between ARO and Saudi Aramco, in addition to backlog for our managed rig services. Substantially all the operating costs for jackups leased to ARO through the bareboat charter agreements will be borne by ARO.
Our drilling contracts generally contain provisions permitting early termination of the contract if the rig is lost or destroyed or by the customer if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, "force majeure" events beyond the control of either party or other specified conditions.  In addition, our drilling contracts generally permit early termination of the contract by the customer for convenience (without cause), exercisable upon advance notice to us, and in some cases without making an early termination payment to us.  There can be no assurances that our customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments to us.  
The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of predictability of various factors, including unscheduled repairs, maintenance requirements, weather delays, contract terminations or renegotiations and other factors. 
See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized and may decline significantly in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may suffer losses if our customers terminate or seek to renegotiate our contracts, if operations are suspended or interrupted or if a rig becomes a total loss.”
Drilling Contracts and Insurance Program
Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of allocation of responsibility for liability between our customer and us for loss or damage to each party's property and third-party property, personal injuries and other claims arising out of our drilling operations. We also maintain insurance for personal injuries, damage to or loss of property and certain business risks. 
Our insurance policies typically consist of 12-month policy periods, and the next renewal date for a substantial portion of our insurance program is scheduled for May 31, 2021. Our insurance program provides coverage, subject to the policies' terms and conditions and to the extent not otherwise assumed by the customer under the indemnification provisions of the drilling contract, for third-party claims arising from our operations, including third-party claims arising from well-control events, named windstorms, sudden and accidental pollution originating from our rigs, wrongful death and personal injury. Third-party pollution claims could also arise from damage to adjacent pipelines and from spills of fluids maintained on the drilling rig. Generally, our program provides liability coverage up to $750.0 million, with a per occurrence deductible of $10.0 million or less. We retain the risk for liability not indemnified by the customer in excess of our insurance coverage.
Well-control events generally include an unintended release from a well that cannot be contained by using equipment on site (e.g., a blowout preventer), by increasing the weight of drilling fluid or by diverting the fluids safely into production facilities. In addition to the third-party coverage described above, for claims relating to a 
well-control event, we also have $150.0 million of coverage available to pay costs of controlling and re-drilling of the well and third-party pollution claims.
Our insurance program also provides coverage to us for physical damage (including total loss) to our rigs, excluding damage arising from a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This coverage is based on an agreed amount for each rig and has a per occurrence deductible for losses ranging from $15.0 million to $25.0 million. Due to the significant premium, high deductible and limited coverage, we do not purchase windstorm insurance for our rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, we retain the risk for windstorm damage to our jackup and floater rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Our drilling contracts customarily provide that each party is responsible for injuries or death to their respective personnel and loss or damage to their respective property (including the personnel and property of each parties’ contractors and subcontractors) regardless of the cause of the loss or damage. However, in certain drilling contracts our customer’s responsibility for damage to its property and the property of its other contractors contains an exception to the extent the loss or damage is due to our negligence, which exception is usually subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence basis, although in some cases we assume responsibility for all damages due to our negligence.  In addition, our drilling contracts typically provide for our customers to indemnify us, generally based on replacement cost minus some level of depreciation, for loss or damage to our down-hole equipment, and in some cases for a limited amount of the replacement cost of our subsea equipment, unless the damage is caused by our negligence, normal wear and tear or defects in our equipment.
Subject to the exceptions noted below, our customers typically assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination arising from operations, including as a result of blowouts, cratering and seepage, when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including costs for clean-up and removal of pollution and third-party damages. In most drilling contracts, we assume liability for third-party damages resulting from such pollution and contamination caused by our negligence, usually subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence or per event basis. In addition, in substantially all of our contracts, the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the reservoir, for loss of hydrocarbons escaping from the reservoir and for the costs of bringing the well under control. Further, subject to the exceptions noted below, most of our contracts provide that the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the well, except when the loss or damage to the well is due to our negligence, in which case most of our contracts provide that the customer's sole remedy is to require us to redrill the lost or damaged portion of the well at a substantially reduced rate and, in some cases, pay for some of the costs to repair the well.
Most of our drilling contracts incorporate a broad exclusion that limits the operator's indemnity for damages and losses resulting from our gross negligence and willful misconduct and for fines and penalties and punitive damages levied or assessed directly against us. This exclusion overrides other provisions in the contract that would otherwise limit our liability for ordinary negligence. In most of these cases, we are still able to negotiate a liability cap (although these caps are significantly higher than the caps we are able to negotiate for ordinary negligence) on our exposure for losses or damages resulting from our gross negligence. In certain cases, the broad exclusion only applies to losses or damages resulting from the gross negligence of our senior supervisory personnel. However, in some cases we have contractually assumed significantly increased exposure or unlimited exposure for losses and damages due to the gross negligence of some or all our personnel, and in most cases, we are not able to contractually limit our exposure for our willful misconduct. 
Notwithstanding our negotiation of express limitations in our drilling contracts for losses or damages resulting from our ordinary negligence and any express limitations (albeit usually much higher) for losses or damages in the event of our gross negligence, under the applicable laws that govern certain of our drilling contracts, the courts will not enforce any indemnity for losses and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. As a result, under the laws of such jurisdictions, the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts that would otherwise limit our liability in the event of our gross negligence or willful misconduct are deemed to be unenforceable as being contrary to public policy, and we are exposed to unlimited liability for losses 
and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct, regardless of any express limitation of our liability in the relevant drilling contracts. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, an indemnity from an operator for losses or damages of third parties resulting from our gross negligence is enforceable, but an indemnity for losses or damages of the operator is not enforceable. In such cases, the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us would be enforceable with respect to third-party claims for losses of damages, such as may arise in pollution claims, but the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us with respect to injury or death to the operator's personnel and the operator’s damages to the well, to the reservoir and for the costs of well control would not be enforceable. Furthermore, although there is a lack of precedential authority for these types of claims in countries where the civil law is applied, in those situations where a fault based codified civil law system is applicable to our drilling contracts, as opposed to the common law system, the courts generally will not enforce a contractual indemnity clause that totally indemnifies us from losses or damages due to our gross negligence but may enforce the contractual indemnity over and above a cap on our liability for gross negligence, assuming the cap requires us to accept a significant amount of liability.
Similar to gross negligence, regardless of any express limitations in a drilling contract regarding our liability for fines and penalties and punitive damages, the laws of most jurisdictions will not enforce an indemnity that indemnifies a party for a fine or penalty that is levied or punitive damages that are assessed directly against such party on the ground that it is against public policy to indemnify a party from a fine and penalty or punitive damages, especially where the purpose of such levy or assessment is to deter the behavior that resulted in the fine or penalty or punish such party for the behavior that warranted the assessment of punitive damages. 
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary as of the date hereof and is general in nature. In addition, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from operators against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract, based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated and the interpretation and enforcement of applicable law when the claim is adjudicated. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor a contractual indemnity obligation that is enforceable under applicable law. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. 
In certain cases, vendors who provide equipment or services to us limit their pollution liability to a specific monetary cap, and we assume the liability above that cap. Typically, in the case of original equipment manufacturers, the cap is a negotiated amount based on mutual agreement of the parties considering the risk profiles and thresholds of each party. However, for smaller vendors, the liability is usually limited to the value, or double the value, of the contract.
We generally indemnify the customer for legal and financial consequences of spills of waste oil, fuels, lubricants, motor oils, pipe dope, paint, solvents, ballast, bilge, garbage, debris, sewage, hazardous waste and other liquids, the discharge of which originates from our rigs or equipment above the surface of the water and in some cases from our subsea equipment. Our contracts generally provide that, in the event of any such spill from our rigs, we are responsible for fines and penalties.
Major Customers
We provide our contract drilling services to major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies. During 2020, our five largest customers accounted for 41% of consolidated revenues. BP, our only customer who accounts for 10% or more of consolidated revenues, accounted for 11% of consolidated revenues.
Competition
The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Drilling contracts are, for the most part, awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is often the primary factor in determining which contractor is awarded a 
contract, although quality of service, operational and safety performance, equipment suitability and availability, location of equipment, reputation and technical expertise also are factors.  There are numerous competitors with significant resources in the offshore contract drilling industry.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our operations are affected by political initiatives and by laws and regulations that relate to the oil and gas industry, including laws and regulations that have or may impose increased financial responsibility and oil spill abatement contingency plan capability requirements. Accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, safety or other policy reasons. It is also possible that these laws and regulations and political initiatives could adversely affect our operations in the future by significantly increasing our operating costs or restricting areas open for drilling activity.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors- Increasing regulatory complexity could adversely impact the costs associated with our offshore drilling operations."
Our operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, pollution, contamination and hazardous waste disposal or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
•require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
•require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;
•require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment; 
•restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling; and
•restrict the production rate of natural resources below the rate that would otherwise be possible.
Environmental laws and regulations specifically applicable to our business activities could impose significant liability on us for damages, clean-up costs, fines and penalties in the event of oil spills or similar discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of our operations, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance or for which indemnity is prohibited by applicable law and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results.  However, the legislative, judicial and regulatory response to any well-control incidents could substantially increase our customers' liabilities in respect of oil spills and also could increase our liabilities. In addition to potential increased liabilities, such legislative, judicial or regulatory action could impose increased financial, insurance or other requirements that may adversely impact the entire offshore drilling industry.
Additionally, environmental laws and regulations are revised frequently, and any changes, including changes in implementation or interpretation, that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for our industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
The International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992, the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Marpol 73/78 (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), the U.K. Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998, as amended, and other related legislation and regulations and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA 90"), as amended, the Clean Water Act and other U.S. federal statutes applicable to us and our operations, as well as similar statutes in Texas, Louisiana, other coastal states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions, address oil spill prevention, reporting and control and have significantly expanded potential liability, fine and penalty exposure across many segments of the oil and gas industry. Such statutes and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills, disposal of waste and liability for resulting damages. For instance, OPA 90 imposes strict and, with limited 
exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs as well as a variety of fines, penalties and damages. Similar environmental laws apply in our other areas of operation. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations may subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance, or for which indemnity is prohibited under applicable law, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
High-profile and catastrophic events such as the 2010 Macondo well incident have heightened governmental and environmental concerns about the oil and gas industry. From time to time, legislative proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas.  We are adversely affected by restrictions on drilling in certain areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, including the adoption of additional safety requirements and policies regarding the approval of drilling permits and restrictions on development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that have and may further impact our operations. 
As a result of the 2010 Macondo well incident, the United States Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") issued a drilling safety rule in 2012 that included requirements for the cementing of wells, well-control barriers, blowout preventers, well-control fluids, well completions, workovers and decommissioning operations. BSEE also issued regulations requiring operators to have safety and environmental management systems ("SEMS") prior to conducting operations and requiring operators and contractors to agree on how the contractors will assist the operators in complying with the SEMS. In addition, in August 2012, BSEE issued an Interim Policy Document ("IPD") stating that it would begin issuing Incidents of Non-Compliance to contractors as well as operators for serious violations of BSEE regulations. Following federal court decisions successfully challenging the scope of BSEE’s jurisdiction over offshore contractors, this IPD has been removed from the list of IPDs on the BSEE website. If this judicial precedent stands, it may reduce regulatory and civil litigation liability exposures.
In late 2014, the United States Coast Guard ("USCG") proposed new regulations that would impose GPS equipment and positioning requirements for drilling rigs operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and issued notices regarding the development of guidelines for cybersecurity measures used in the marine and offshore energy sectors for all vessels and facilities that are subject to the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 ("MTSA"), including our rigs. The regulations imposing GPS equipment and positioning requirements have not yet been issued. In March 2020, the USCG issued its “Guidelines for Addressing Cyber Risks at MTSA Regulated Facilities” in order to assist facility owners and operators in complying with the requirements to assess, document, and address computer system or network vulnerabilities. The MTSA regulations provide general requirements for regulated facility cybersecurity while allowing facility owners and operators the discretion to determine the details of how they will comply. Facility owners and operators are responsible for assessing and documenting cybersecurity vulnerabilities and ensuring cybersecurity of their facilities under the Coast Guard’s oversight and guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the new USCG guidelines and the extent to which the BSEE or other regulators will review our ability to address cybersecurity risks at MTSA-regulated facilities. As the USCG provides further detail on how these guidelines will be implemented, we will address our cybersecurity program to comply with any regulations that are ultimately promulgated.
On July 28, 2016, BSEE adopted a new well-control rule that will be implemented in phases over the next several years (the "2016 Well Control Rule"). This new rule includes more stringent design requirements for well-control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. Subsequently, on May 2, 2019, BSEE issued the 2019 Well Control Rule, the revised well control and blowout preventer rule governing the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activities. The new rule revised existing regulations impacting offshore oil and gas drilling, completions, workovers and decommissioning activities. Specifically, the 2019 Well Control Rule addresses six areas of offshore operations: well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment. The revisions were targeted to ensure safety and environmental protection while correcting errors in the 2016 rule and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden. We have not incurred significant costs to comply with the 2016 Well Control Rule or 2019 Well Control Rule.
The continuing and evolving threat of cyber attacks will likely require increased expenditures to strengthen cyber risk management systems for drilling rigs and onshore facilities. For example, on May 11, 2017, an executive 
order was issued entitled Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, which is intended to improve the nation's ability to defend against increasing and evolving cyber attacks, and in July 2017 the USCG issued proposed cybersecurity guidelines for port facilities and offshore facilities, including drilling rigs, that could be impacted by cyber attacks. We cannot currently estimate the future expenditures associated with increased regulatory requirements, which may be material, and we continue to monitor regulatory changes as they occur.
Additionally, climate change is receiving increasing attention from scientists and legislators, and significant focus is being put on companies that are active producers of hydrocarbon resources. Globally, there are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals at various levels of government to address the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, such as laws or regulations incentivizing or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy and programs to mandate or incentivize the conversion from internal combustion engine powered vehicles to electric-powered vehicles. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming oil, and thereby reduce demand for oil, which could reduce our customers’ demand for our services. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could have an adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. 
Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement in November 2020, the current Presidential Administration officially reentered the United States into the agreement in February 2021. It is likely that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, restricting, or delaying oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated. For example, the current Presidential administration has issued multiple executive orders pertaining to environmental regulations and climate change, including the (1) Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis and (2) Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. The latter executive order announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices, established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration and affirmed that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before mid-century is a critical priority.
If new laws are enacted or other government actions are taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our principal areas of operation, impose additional regulatory (including environmental protection) requirements that materially increase the liabilities, financial requirements or operating or equipment costs associated with offshore drilling, exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas, or promote other sources of clean energy, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations." 
Non-U.S. Operations
Revenues from non-U.S. operations were 83%, 85% and 87% of our total consolidated revenues during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our non-U.S. operations and shipyard rig construction and enhancement projects are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including:
•terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances, 
•expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our equipment or our customer's property, 
•repudiation or nationalization of contracts, 
•assaults on property or personnel, 
•piracy, kidnapping and extortion demands, 
•significant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies and customers, 
•unexpected changes in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws, 
•work stoppages, often due to strikes over which we have little or no control, 
•complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations, 
•limitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas, 
•imposition of trade barriers, 
•wage and price controls, 
•import-export quotas, 
•exchange restrictions, 
•currency fluctuations, 
•changes in monetary policies, 
•uncertainty or instability resulting from hostilities or other crises in the Middle East, West Africa, Latin America or other geographic areas in which we operate, 
•changes in the manner or rate of taxation, 
•limitations on our ability to recover amounts due, 
•increased risk of government and vendor/supplier corruption, 
•increased local content requirements,
•the occurrence or threat of epidemic or pandemic diseases and any government response to such occurrence or threat,
•changes in political conditions, and 
•other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control.
See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our non-U.S. operations involve additional risks not associated with U.S. operations."
