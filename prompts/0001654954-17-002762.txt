ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------


 
  Lode-Star Mining INC. (formerly International Gold Corp.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 9, 2004 for the purpose of acquiring and exploring mineral properties.  Our principal executive offices are located at 13529 Skinner Road, Suite N, Cypress, Texas 77429-1775. We also maintain a Canadian business office at 666 Burrard Street, Suite 600, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 2X8.
  
  On May 12, 2015, International Gold Corp. completed a merger with its wholly owned subsidiary, Lode-Star Mining INC., and formally assumed the subsidiary’s name by filing Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State (the “Name Change”).  The subsidiary was incorporated entirely for the purpose of effecting the Name Change and the merger did not affect our corporate structure in any other way.
  
  We have no revenues, have losses since inception, have no direct operations, and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor. We are relying upon the sale of securities and loans to fund our operations. We have no employees and expect to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary for the next twelve months.
  
  Mineral Property Interest
  
  Further to a Mineral Option Agreement dated October 4, 2014, on December 5, 2014, we entered into a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Lode Star Gold INC. (“LSG”), a private Nevada corporation, pursuant to which we agreed to issue 35,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $230,180, to LSG in exchange for a 20% undivided beneficial interest in and to the mineral claims owned by LSG (the “Acquisition”). The Closing Date of the Subscription Agreement was December 11, 2014 (the “Closing Date”).The mineral claims, known as the “Goldfield Bonanza Project” (the “Property”), are located in the State of Nevada.
  
  The Mineral Option Agreement can be found as Exhibit 10.1 to our report filed on Form 8-K on October 9, 2014 and is incorporated by reference, shown as Exhibit 10.5 to this report. The Subscription Agreement can be found as Exhibit 10.7 to our report filed on Form 10-K/A on January 11, 2017 and is incorporated by reference, shown as Exhibit 10.7 to this report.
  
  The execution of the Subscription Agreement was one of the closing conditions of the Mineral Option Agreement dated October 4, 2014, (the “Effective Date”) pursuant to which we acquired the sole and exclusive option to earn up to an 80% undivided interest in and to the Property.  In order to earn the additional 60% interest in the Property, we are required to fund all expenditures on the Property and pay LSG an aggregate of $5 million in cash from the Property’s mineral production proceeds in the form of a net smelter royalty (“NSR”). Until such time as we have earned the additional 60% interest, the NSR will be split 79.2% to LSG, 19.8% to us and 1% to the former Property owner.
  
  If we fail to make any cash payments to LSG within one year of the Effective Date, we are required to pay LSG an additional $100,000, and in any subsequent years in which we fail to complete the payment of the entire $5 million described above, we must make quarterly cash payments to LSG of $25,000 until such time as we have earned the additional 60% interest in the Property.
  
  Given that permitting for operations on the Property is still to be completed, LSG granted a series of deferrals of the payments, with the most recent being granted on January 11, 2017. LSG agreed on that date to defer payment of all amounts due in accordance with the Mineral Option Agreement until further notice. On January 17, 2017, the Company and LSG agreed that as of January 1, 2017, all outstanding balances shall carry a compound interest rate of 5% per annum. It was further agreed that the ongoing payment deferral shall apply to interest and principal.
  
  The Option Agreement provides that we will act as the operator on the Property and that a management committee will be formed, comprised of representatives from us and LSG, with voting based on each party’s proportionate interest, to supervise exploration of the Property and approve work programs and budgets. To the date of this report, no work programs have been approved and LSG has borne all costs in connection with operations on the Property. We expect the first work program, entailing Property-related costs for which we will be responsible, to be approved in the latter half of 2017.
  
  Change in Shell Company Status
  
  Prior to our acquisition of the mineral property interest, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) since we were not generating revenues, did not own an operating business, did not have any assets other than cash and cash equivalents, and had no specific plan other than to engage in a merger or acquisition transaction with an operating company or business.

  Change in Control of Registrant
  
  As a result of the Acquisition, LSG acquired 35,000,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 71.2% (currently) of the total voting power of all of our outstanding voting securities. LSG assumed control from the holders of our issued and outstanding common stock, and in particular our former president, who owned approximately 24.3% of our common stock prior to the Closing Date.
  
  Lode-Star Gold INC. (“LSG”)
  
  LSG was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 13, 1998 for the purpose of acquiring exploration stage mineral properties.  It currently has one shareholder, Lonnie Humphries, who is the spouse of Mark Walmesley, our President and Chief Financial Officer.  Mr. Walmesley is also the Director of Operations and a director of LSG.
  
  LSG acquired the leases to the Property in 1997 and became the registered and beneficial owner of the Property on September 19, 2009.  Since the earlier of those dates, it has conducted contract exploration work on the Property but has not determined whether it contains mineral reserves that are economically recoverable.
  
  LSG is an exploration stage company and has not generated any revenues since its inception.  The Property represents its only material asset.
