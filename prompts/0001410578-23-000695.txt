ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 27, 2020 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
On November 24, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering (“Public Offering”) of 11,500,000 units, including the issuance of 1,500,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of (i) one share of Class A common stock (“public shares”) and (ii) three-fourths of one redeemable warrant (“public warrants”). Each whole public warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $115,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Public Offering, on August 17, 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 shares of Class B common stock (the “founder shares”) for $25,000, or $0.006 per share. On October 22, 2020, our sponsor surrendered 718,750 founder shares for no consideration. On November 3, 2020, sponsor surrendered an additional 718,750 founder shares for no consideration. The number of founder shares outstanding was determined based on the Company’s expectation that the total size of the Public Offering would be a maximum of 11,500,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was exercised in full, and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Public Offering.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 6,481,550 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to sponsor and one of the Company’s directors at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $6,481,550. The private placement warrants are identical to the public warrants, except that the private placement warrants, so long as they are held by sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by such holders until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. If the Company does not consummate its initial business combination, the private placement warrants will expire worthless.
Additionally, in lieu of 0.9% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, we issued to Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. 104,000 units (“Underwriter Units”) simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering. The Underwriter Units are identical to the units sold in the Public Offering, except that, so long as they are held by Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. or its permitted transferees, the warrants underlying the Underwriter Units (i) will not be redeemable by us, (ii) may not (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights. In addition, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. has agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to the shares underlying the Underwriter Units in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination by May 24, 2023.
Upon the closing of the Public Offering and the Private Placement, $117,848,550 was placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $4,025,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $529,972 in expenses relating to the Public

Offering, approximately $801,833 of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes.
On May 18, 2022, we convened its special meeting in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders at which our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation extending the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination from May 24, 2022 to November 24, 2022. In connection therewith, holders of 10,036,744 public shares exercised their right to redeem such public shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account. On May 20, 2022, the Company paid from the Trust Account an aggregate amount of $102,894,278, or approximately $10.25 per share to redeeming shareholders. Additionally, for each one-month extension, the Sponsor agreed to contribute, as a loan, to the Company $60,969, or approximately $0.04 per public share not redeemed in connection with such extension amendment. Through November 2022 an aggregate of $365,814 was loaned to the Company and subsequently deposited by the Company into the Trust Account.
On November 23, 2022, we convened its special meeting in lieu of an annual meeting of stockholders at which our stockholders approved a further amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation extending the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination from November 24, 2022 to May 24, 2023. In connection therewith, holders of 954,800 public shares exercised their right to redeem such public shares for a pro rata portion of the Trust Account. On November 21, 2022, the Company paid from the Trust Account an aggregate amount of $10,142,765, or approximately $10.62 per share to such redeeming shareholders. Additionally, in connection with such extension amendment, Wentworth agreed to pay for certain merger related expenses, including depositing $69,218 per month, or approximately $0.25 per share for each public share not redeemed in connection with the extension amendment, into the Trust Account through May 2023. As of December 31, 2022, Wentworth owes an aggregate of $198,522 to the Company for these items.
 Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, and to fund our working capital requirements (subject to an annual limit of $100,000), our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended from time to time (“Charter”) provides that none of the funds held in trust will be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any of the shares of Class A common stock sold as part of the units sold in our Public Offering (“public shares”) properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Charter to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of the public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by May 24, 2023 or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of 100% of the public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by May 24, 2023. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
As of December 31, 2022, after giving effect to the redemptions of public shares and additional contributions made to the Trust Account, there was $5,514,494 cash held in the Trust Account and $277,511 of cash held outside the Trust Account available for working capital purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no funds had been withdrawn from the Trust Account to pay the Company’s taxes.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our shares of Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, 

6



including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses even if the acquisitions of the target businesses are not closed simultaneously.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we have conducted a thorough due diligence review encompassing, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Merger Agreement
On July 7, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Binah Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Holdings”), Kingswood Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Kingswood Merger Sub”), Wentworth Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wentworth Merger Sub”), and Wentworth Management Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Wentworth”). Each of Holdings, Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub are newly formed entities that were formed for the sole purpose of entering into and consummating the transactions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Holdings is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Kingswood and both Kingswood Merger Sub and Wentworth Merger Sub are wholly-owned direct subsidiaries of Holdings.
The business combination contemplated by the Merger Agreement is structured as a “double dummy” transaction, pursuant to which: (i) Kingswood Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Kingswood Merger”), with the Company surviving the Kingswood Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings (the “Kingswood Surviving Company”); (ii) simultaneously with the Kingswood Merger, Wentworth Merger Sub will merge with and into Wentworth (the “Wentworth Merger”), with Wentworth surviving the Wentworth Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (the “Wentworth Surviving Company”). Kingswood Surviving

Company will acquire, and Holdings will contribute to Kingswood Surviving Company (the “Holdings Contribution”) all units of the Wentworth Surviving Company directly held by Holdings after the Wentworth Merger, such that, following the Holdings Contribution, the Wentworth Surviving Company will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Kingswood Surviving Company (together with the Kingswood Merger, the Wentworth Merger and the other transactions related thereto, the “Transactions”).
In connection with the Kingswood Merger, our stockholders will have the right to receive (i) one share of Holdings common stock in exchange for each share of Class A common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Kingswood Merger, and (ii) one Holdings warrant in exchange for each public warrant of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Kingswood Merger. Each such Holdings warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of Holdings common stock at a price of $11.50 per share and will have terms comparable to the public warrants.
Our sponsor, as a stockholder of the Company, will have the right to receive (i) one share of Holdings common stock in exchange for each Founder Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Kingswood Merger, and (ii) up to one Holdings warrant in exchange for each Private Placement Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Kingswood Merger, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Each such Holdings warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of Holdings common stock at a price of $11.50 per share and will have terms comparable to the private placement warrants.
In connection with the Transactions, the consideration payable to securityholders in Wentworth (the “Wentworth Merger Consideration”) will consist of Holdings common shares issued on the closing date of the Transactions (the “Share Consideration”), and the assumption of all indebtedness of Wentworth as of the closing date of the Transactions (the “Assumed Indebtedness”). The Wentworth Merger Consideration is equal to the quotient of: (a) the difference of (i) enterprise value, minus (ii) closing Wentworth indebtedness, minus (iii) sponsor share value, minus (iv) outstanding Transaction expenses, minus (v) Wentworth Class B Redemption Amount, divided by (b) the Per Share Price; provided, however, that, in no event shall the Wentworth Merger Consideration be less than the Minimum Wentworth Share Amount.
The Merger Agreements contains additional representations, warranties, covenants, conditions precedent and other terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type, including, but not limited to approval by our shareholders of the Merger Agreement. The terms of the Merger Agreement and other related ancillary agreements are summarized in more detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2022.
On December 30, 2022, the Company, Holdings, and Wentworth entered into a side letter agreement to the Merger Agreement revising the Merger Agreement to extend the termination date of the Merger Agreement from December 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023.
On March 20, 2023, Kingswood, Holdings, Kingswood Merger Sub, Wentworth Merger Sub and Wentworth entered that certain First Amendment to the Merger Agreement (the “Amendment”) which amends the Merger Agreement to, among other things, (i) amend and restate the definition of “Transaction Expenses Shortfall” in the Merger Agreement to an amount equal to (x) the Outstanding Transaction Expenses (as defined in the Merger Agreement) minus (y) the Available Closing Date Cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (ii) ·
amend and restate the condition precedent in Section 8.03(k) of the Merger Agreement to require that Available Closing Date Cash be sufficient to cover an amount equal to the sum of $3,500,000 and the Outstanding Transaction Expenses; and (iii) amend and restate the termination rights in Section 9.01(c)(B) to allow for the termination of the Merger Agreement if the Available Closing Date Cash is insufficient to cover the sum of $3,500,000 and the Outstanding Transaction Expenses.
Support Agreements
Contemporaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, (i) certain holders of the Kingswood common stock, including our sponsor, entered into the Founder Support Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, such holders agreed to approve the Merger Agreement, and (ii) securityholders of Wentworth representing a majority of Wentworth’s outstanding membership interests entered into the Wentworth Support Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, such Wentworth securityholders agreed to approve the Merger Agreement.
In addition, the holders of our private placement warrants have agreed that at the effective time of the Kingswood Merger, the aggregate number of issued and outstanding private placement warrants held by the Sponsor Support Holders shall be adjusted in the following manner: (i) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and proceeds from any PIPE is less than $15,000,000 then 100% of the private placement warrants will be forfeited; (ii) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and 

8



proceeds from any PIPE is equal to or greater than $15,000,000 but less than $17,500,000 then 90% of the private placement warrants will be forfeited; (iii) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and proceeds from any PIPE is equal to or greater than $17,500,000 but less than $20,000,000 then 80% of the private placement warrants would be forfeited; (iv) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and proceeds from any PIPE is equal to or greater than $20,000,000 but less than $22,500,000 then 70% of the private placement warrants will be forfeited; (v) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and proceeds from any PIPE is equal to or greater than $22,500,000 but less than $25,000,000 then 60% of the private placement warrants will be forfeited; (vi) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and proceeds from any PIPE is equal to or greater than $25,000,000 but less than $27,500,000 then 50% of the private placement warrants will be forfeited; (vii) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and proceeds from any PIPE is equal to or greater than $27,500,000 but less than $30,000,000 then 40% of the private placement warrants will be forfeited; (viii) if the aggregate of the cash remaining in the Trust Account and proceeds from any PIPE is equal to or greater than $30,000,000 then 0% of the private placement warrants will be forfeited.
The terms of the Founder Support Agreement and Wentworth Support Agreement are summarized in more detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 7, 2022.
Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their public shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its public shares. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after the Public Offering in connection with the completion of our business combination.
Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of public shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with 

9



applicable law and any applicable listing standards. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our public shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. If our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their public shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such purchases of public shares could be to (i) vote such public shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. Our Charter may be amended with a stockholder vote to extend the time required to consummate an initial business combination.
Limitation on Redemption Rights Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Charter provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to excess public shares without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of public shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force the Company or management to purchase their public shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the public shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s public shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the public shares, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their public shares (including excess public shares) for or against the Company’s initial business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
The amendments to our Charter provide that we will have until May 24, 2023 to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by May 24, 2023, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate our initial business combination by May 24, 2023.

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses: 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to redeem or repurchase public shares held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot guarantee that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
Employees
We currently have two executive officers: Michael Nessim and Gary Wilder. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Available Information
We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control, acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 17 Battery Place, Room 625, New York, NY 10004 or by telephone at (212) 404-7002.

Legal Proceedings
To the knowledge of our management team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property.
