Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates, developed using our protein engineering expertise and proprietary single domain antibody, or sdAb, platform. With the goal of addressing unmet medical needs, we leverage our deep understanding of target biology and innovative protein engineering technologies to create therapeutic candidates with attributes and mechanisms of action that are superior to current approaches and applicable to a range of challenging, validated targets with high potential. Our sdAb platform allows us to pursue validated targets with clinical promise where other antibody and biologic based approaches have failed. Highly modular, our sdAbs can be combined with precise valencies and multiple specificities, creating therapeutic candidates designed to be capable of enhanced cell signaling, conditional activation or combined synergistic functions. 
Our clinical pipeline is enabled by our protein and process engineering capabilities, and includes therapeutic candidates in the following categories:
•INBRX-101 seeks to maintain the natural function of Alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT, in a recombinant format, optimized for less frequent dosing and greater potential therapeutic activity as compared to plasma-derived AAT, or pdAAT;
•INBRX-109 and INBRX-106 utilize our multivalent formats, for which the precise valency was optimized in a target-centric way to mediate what we believe to be the most appropriate agonist function; and
•INBRX-105’s mechanism of action is enabled by a multi-specific format that we believe enables programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, targeted 4-1BB agonism.

Our Leadership Team 
We have assembled a team with deep scientific and clinical experience in discovering and developing protein therapeutics. Our in-house capabilities span the disciplines of discovery, protein engineering, cell biology, translational research, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, clinical development, and commercialization. Members of our team bring experience from multiple organizations including Genentech, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck & Co., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., and the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Our board of directors is comprised of individuals with proven business and scientific accomplishments and significant operating knowledge of our company. 
Our Strategy 
Our mission is to discover and develop effective biologic treatments for people with life-threatening conditions and to evolve Inhibrx into a commercial-stage biotechnology company with a differentiated and sustainable product portfolio by focusing on the following: 
Rapidly advance and optimize the clinical development of our lead programs. 
We are focused on rapidly advancing our four therapeutic candidates, each with key clinical data readouts expected in 2022 and during the first half of 2023. To augment our U.S.-centric clinical strategy for our oncology therapeutic candidates, we have formed collaborations in China designed to provide access to patient populations for clinical trials not readily available in the United States, including treatment-naïve patients, and to facilitate rapid patient enrollment with the goal of generating more robust early clinical data. We believe this harmonized clinical strategy may allow us to accelerate our development timelines. 
Apply our sdAb platform and other protein technologies to create differentiated therapeutics in focused disease areas with particular emphasis on oncology. 
We have developed an sdAb platform and other protein technologies that we believe can be applied to meet the specific challenges of complex target biology. Our current pipeline is focused on oncology and orphan diseases. We plan to focus our internal clinical development where we believe we can create solutions to address the challenges of both validated and novel targets and generate differentiated therapeutics that can be advanced efficiently through clinical development.
Maintain our culture of innovation, execution and efficiency.
Over the last 12 years we have successfully built an innovative culture that encourages scientific risk-taking within the bounds of our data-driven philosophy. This enables our research and development team to discover numerous promising preclinical candidates cost effectively, from which we select what we believe are highly differentiated programs for clinical development. 
Maximize the potential of our therapeutic pipeline by retaining rights as well as selectively entering into additional strategic partnerships depending on the therapeutic candidate, indication and geography. 
We have a disciplined strategy to maximize the potential of our therapeutic pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those therapeutic candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can develop and eventually commercialize successfully and efficiently on our own if they are approved, while also seeking to enter into additional strategic partnerships where we believe partnering will accelerate our development timelines and/or maximize the worldwide commercial potential of any approved therapeutic candidates. For example, we have granted Chiesi an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize INBRX-101 outside of the United States and Canada following completion of the Phase 1 trial. In addition, we are currently party to license agreements for the development and, if approved, commercialization of INBRX-105, INBRX-106 and INBRX-109 solely in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We otherwise possess the worldwide rights to these candidates. Where appropriate, we plan to seek to enter into additional strategic partnerships with the goal of maximizing the potential of our therapeutic pipeline. 
Selectively enter into additional strategic partnerships to maximize the potential of our protein engineering technologies in non-core areas or indications ancillary to oncology.
We believe that the broad potential of our protein engineering technologies, coupled with our strong intellectual property portfolio, can lead to the generation of multiple additional novel product candidates addressing a wide range of therapeutic areas. For example, we licensed our sdAb technologies for specific binders to 2seventy bio, Inc. (formerly bluebird bio, Inc.), or 2seventy, for use in cell therapy. Moreover, we have several preclinical programs focused on non-oncology indications that we are actively seeking to license. Where appropriate, we plan to continue to seek to opportunistically enter into additional strategic partnerships in areas that are considered non-core or indications ancillary to oncology to maximize the potential of our technology platform.
Our sdAb Platform Technology 
Antibodies are multifunctional, Y-shaped proteins, made up of a pair of interacting heavy and light chains to form a symmetric, dimeric molecule with four total protein chains. Each arm of the antibody contains an antigen binding region (also referred to as the variable fragment, or Fv), which consists of both a heavy and light variable domain, or VH and VL, respectively, held together through interaction of constant domains. The Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) portion of the heavy-chain constant domain extends the half-life of the antibody in circulation and has the potential to modulate the function of immune cells through interaction with various Fc receptors found on the surface of cells of the immune system. 
We believe that antibody Fv domains are not optimal building blocks for multispecific and multivalent therapeutics due to the extensive protein engineering required to ensure the correct pairing of the appropriate VH and VL domains to construct functional Fvs. To overcome the limitations and formatting challenges of conventional antibodies, we developed our sdAb platform to enable the streamlined production of protein formats with multiple antigen specificities. 
sdAbs provide a small, simple, modular target binding domain that can be combined in a variety of ways to meet the unique needs of each biological target. We have deep domain expertise surrounding discovery, humanization and optimization of sdAbs and their incorporation into unique configurations enabling the generation of therapeutic candidates with favorable drug-like properties and differentiated mechanisms of action. We have created various multivalent and multispecific therapeutic formats that are each designed to achieve unique functions specifically tailored to the requirements of a given biological target, including the ability to:
•effectively cluster receptors with precisely defined valency; 
•simultaneously engage multiple antigens or epitopes; 
•combine synergistic functions in a single molecule; 
•restrict therapeutic activity to specific micro environments in the body; and 
•be readily manufactured at high yields with established processes used to produce therapeutic proteins.
We have also developed a series of patented modifications to our humanized sdAb scaffold, which are designed to eliminate recognition by pre-existing anti-drug antibodies without compromising affinity, specificity or stability of the sdAb. Previously, the presence of pre-existing anti-drug antibodies in human serum limited the broad use of these agents as therapeutics. We believe our improvement, combined with our extensive knowledge of the structural nuances of sdAbs, will enable modernized development of therapeutic candidates with favorable biophysical properties, and will greatly extend the utility and applicability of our sdAb platform. 
Our Pipeline 
INBRX-101 
INBRX-101 is a precisely engineered recombinant human AAT-Fc fusion protein therapeutic candidate that we are developing for the treatment of patients with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, or AATD. We believe INBRX-101 has the potential to be dosed monthly, while maintaining patients in the normal range of AAT exposure, which would be a significant improvement for patients currently receiving weekly infusions. Through our proprietary engineering capabilities, we were able to overcome the challenges of producing AAT recombinantly and manufacturing at commercial scale.
Overview of AATD 
AATD is an inherited disease that causes an increased risk of developing pulmonary disease defined by progressive loss of lung tissue and function and is associated with decreased life expectancy. The pulmonary manifestations of AATD include the entire spectrum of emphysema and disorders associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with AATD harbor mutations in the AAT-encoding gene Serpin family A member 1, which causes AAT protein misfolding, loss of activity, and retention in the liver. AAT is a protease inhibitor that primarily targets human neutrophil elastase, or NE, an enzyme that is released by white blood cells in response to infections and has the capacity to degrade normal tissues, especially in the lung, if not tightly controlled by AAT. 
Unmet Medical Need
This disease affects roughly 100,000 people in the United States, with a similar number of patients in Europe. Since AATD must be diagnosed using laboratory testing and cannot be diagnosed by symptoms or by a medical examination alone, it is believed that many individuals with AATD are likely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. In April 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, allowed for the marketing of direct-to-consumer tests that provide genetic risk information for certain conditions, including AATD. We believe such tests will lead to earlier diagnosis and an increase in the number of patients identified with AATD.
The approved standard of care for AATD has been augmentation therapy using pdAAT and has not been substantially improved since 1987. Plasma-derived treatments are highly dependent on human donor blood supply, which is costly and can be limited. Due to the short half-life of pdAAT therapeutics, patients require weekly infusions to achieve and maintain serum concentration above the protective threshold, presumed to be 11 µM. However, even with frequent treatments, the AAT serum concentration following treatment remains considerably below the normal range of 20 to 50 µM. There is clinical evidence suggesting that maintenance of higher AAT serum trough levels may better protect against lung function decline. The graph below is an adaptation based on published data that depicts the pharmacokinetic profile of pdAAT. The published results from the RAPID trial(1) revealed the correlation of serum AAT through levels and lung density decline in AATD patients. Additionally, there are other significant barriers to treatment for patients with AATD, including under-diagnosis, high cost of chronic augmentation therapy, difficulties associated with administering intravenous infusions on a weekly basis, and plasma collection practices that may not be sustainable.

Our Solution - INBRX-101
INBRX-101 is a recombinant AAT protein that is comprised of two human AAT molecules covalently linked to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G4. AAT has proven difficult to develop recombinantly, often displaying loss of activity and experiencing accelerated degradation. Fusion of AAT to the Fc region allows for production using a standard antibody expression system, which, when combined with our proprietary AAT-function preserving purification process, generates substantial and scalable yields of active recombinant AAT protein.
Clinical Data 
In July 2019, we initiated an open-label, dose escalating Phase 1 trial which is being conducted in approximately 10 clinical sites in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand and will enroll a total of approximately 42 patients. The trial is designed as single ascending dose, or SAD, administrations of INBRX-101, with doses of 10 
mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg, followed by multiple ascending dose, or MAD, administrations of INBRX-101, with doses of 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg. These doses are administered every three weeks intravenously to patients diagnosed with AATD who are either treatment naïve or previously treated with pdAAT therapeutics. The primary objective of the trial is safety and tolerability. Secondary objectives include AAT serum exposure, immunogenicity, as measured by frequency of anti-drug antibodies, and NE activity. Exploratory endpoints include biomarkers of AAT. In addition, we will measure pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or BALF, for those patients who received MAD administrations of INBRX-101 at doses of 80 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg.
In October 2021, we announced initial results from Phase 1, Part 1 (SAD) of this trial. Interim functional pharmacokinetic, or PK, data were from 21 patients with AATD, all with the ZZ mutation of the SERPINA1 gene. Interim safety data were from 24 patients with AATD. There were no drug-related severe or serious adverse events at doses up to and including 120 mg/kg single dose and 80mg/kg multi-dose. Drug-related adverse events were predominantly mild with a few moderate events and all were transient and reversible. No signs of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were seen.
Dose related increases in maximal and total INBRX-101 exposure occurred across the entirety of the tested SAD range of 10 to 120 mg/kg. 
–The shaded region represents the normal range of functional AAT in healthy adults.
–The dashed line at 11µM indicates the functional AAT goal of the current augmentation therapy with pdAAT.
–Day 21 data from the 120 mg/kg cohort are from the first 2 enrolled patients with available data.
–Results shown are from preliminary, unaudited data announced in October 2021.
Data from the first MAD cohort of INBRX-101 at 40 mg/kg IV every three weeks showed the expected accumulation of functional AAT levels with observed trough levels exceeding the goal of the current standard augmentation therapy with pdAAT. 
We expect to announce additional data from this trial during the first half of 2022, including BALF data for those patients who received MAD administrations of INBRX-101 at doses of 80 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg. The end of Phase 1 meeting with the FDA will be planned after completion of this study, and based on the feedback from the agency, a potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 program will be initiated.
INBRX-109 
INBRX-109 is a precisely engineered tetravalent sdAb-based therapeutic candidate targeting death-receptor 5, or DR5, a TNFRSF member, also known as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, or TRAIL, receptor 2. DR5 activation induces cancer-specific programmed cell death. The valency of INBRX-109 was selected to maximize the therapeutic index. In patients treated with INBRX-109 to date in our Phase 1 clinical trial, we have observed signs of single agent activity in serious, life-threatening medical conditions that have limited treatment options. We initiated cohorts with INBRX-109 in combination with standard chemotherapies in several indications. Additionally, in June 2021, we initiated a potential registration-enabling Phase 2 trial for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma.
Background on DR5 
Apoptosis is a critical process for maintaining healthy tissue homeostasis, but this process is frequently altered in cancer patients leading to the accumulation of malignant cells. Apoptotic signaling pathways are tightly regulated by the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, and their therapeutic modulation has the potential to be exploited for the treatment of cancer. Targeting the anti-apoptotic proteins has been a clinically successful strategy. For example, Venetoclax, an inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma 2, or Bcl-2, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2016. 
Alternatively, we believe therapeutically targeting pro-apoptotic proteins such as DR5 is a promising oncology treatment strategy. DR5 signaling is induced by clustering of multiple receptors, which initiates an apoptotic signaling pathway resulting in cell death. The strength of apoptotic signaling is proportional to the degree of DR5 clustering. Importantly, although DR5 is expressed throughout the body, cancer cells have been shown to be more sensitive to DR5 signaling compared to healthy cells of normal tissues. 
The promise of inducing cancer-specific cell death has led to extensive efforts by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to therapeutically exploit the DR5 pathway for the treatment of cancer. These initial efforts centered around developing recombinant versions of the DR5 ligand, TRAIL, and agonistic bivalent DR5 antibodies. Despite 
demonstrated clinical safety as single agents and in combination with chemotherapies, these first generation DR5 agonists failed to meet clinical efficacy endpoints. We believe these failures were caused by insufficient clustering of DR5, which is necessary for activation of this pathway. 
Unmet Medical Need
We are currently investigating INBRX-109 in chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. These are some of the most aggressive diseases, some of which are also orphan oncology indications that have shown signs of activity in preclinical studies. These indications and many of these cancer subtypes do not respond well to currently approved immunotherapies and represent a significant unmet need. 
Our Solution - INBRX-109 
INBRX-109 is a tetravalent agonist of DR5 that we designed with our sdAb platform to drive cancer-selective programmed cell death and to maximize potency while minimizing on-target liver toxicity arising from hepatocyte apoptosis. We believe INBRX-109 has the potential to overcome the limitations of previous DR5 agonists. As shown in the diagram below, INBRX-109 is comprised of four DR5 targeted sdAbs fused to an Fc region that has been modified to prevent Fc receptor interactions. In preclinical studies, we have observed that INBRX-109 has the ability to potently agonize DR5 through efficient receptor clustering, causing cancer cell death. Based upon experience with earlier generation DR5 agonists, hepatocytes appear to be a non-cancerous cell type particularly sensitive to DR5 agonism. We have engineered INBRX-109 with our proprietary sdAb modifications to reduce recognition by pre-existing anti-drug antibodies in humans, which can lessen the potential for hyper-clustering and thereby reduce potential hepatotoxicity.
Primary objectives of the Phase 1 trial are safety, tolerability, and determination of the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and recommended Phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives were serum exposure and immunogenicity, as measured by frequency of anti-drug antibodies. Exploratory objectives included clinical anti-tumor efficacy, based on response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival, as well as evaluation of potential predictive diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. 
INBRX-109: Tetravalent DR5 Agonistic Antibody
Clinical Data 
The IND, or Investigational New Drug Application, for INBRX-109 became effective in August 2018, and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States in November 2018. This Phase 1 clinical trial is designed as an open-label, three-part trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Part 1
Part 1 of the trial utilized a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design escalating INBRX-109 as a single agent from 0.3 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg. Twenty patients were enrolled in this portion of the trial, which was completed in August 2019. INBRX-109 was observed to be well-tolerated without significant toxicities observed at doses up to and including the maximum administered dose of 30 mg/kg. No MTD was reached. 
Part 2
In September 2019, we commenced single agent dose expansion cohorts, Part 2 of this trial. As of February 1, 2022, we have enrolled approximately 112 patients in single agent dose cohorts in the following tumor types: colorectal and gastric adenocarcinomas, malignant pleural mesothelioma, chondrosarcoma and synovial sarcoma. 
Part 3
To date, we have initiated chemotherapy combination cohorts in malignant pleural mesothelioma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Ewing sarcoma and colorectal cancer cohorts. We expect to announce initial data from these cohorts in late 2022. 
Initial Results from Phase 1, Part 2
INBRX-109 Chondrosarcoma
Chondrosarcoma is a rare malignant bone tumor composed of cartilage matrix-producing cells. It is reported to be the second most common primary bone sarcoma with an incidence of 1 in 200,000 per year globally. The incidence in the United States is reported to be about 1,400 cases per year. There is currently no approved systemic treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease. The placebo arm of a placebo-controlled trial, which tested the hedgehog pathway inhibitor IPI-926 in this indication had a progression free survival of approximately three months. In this trial, IPI-926 did not result in any partial responses and only a small subset of patients had minor reductions in their tumor size.
Stable disease or partial responses were observed in 16 out of 22 patients with chondrosarcoma based on the initial data from the chondrosarcoma cohort of our Phase 1 trial. Two of these patients’ scans were still pending and four of these patients were still on treatment as of October 1, 2021. In January 2021, the FDA granted fast track designation to INBRX-109 for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma. On November 24, 2021, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation for INBRX-109 for the treatment of chondrosarcoma.
In June 2021, we initiated a potential registration-enabling Phase 2 trial in this patient population, which will enroll approximately 200 patients in total, with progression free survival as the primary endpoint. We expect to announce data from this trial in mid-2024. 
Primary objectives of the ongoing Phase 2 trial are to evaluate the efficacy of INBRX-109 as measured by progression free survival, or PFS, as measured by an independent radiology review. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the overall survival, PFS by investigator assessment, quality of life, objective response rate, disease control rate, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibodies to INBRX-109.

INBRX-109 Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
Mesothelioma is a malignant tumor most often caused by inhaled asbestos fibers which accumulate in the lining of the lungs, abdomen or heart. The epithelioid subtype is the most common histology of malignant pleural mesothelioma, reportedly comprising about 70% of all cases. It is estimated that as many as 43,000 people worldwide die from mesothelioma each year. There are currently limited approved therapeutic treatments. 
We observed signs of single agent activity in the Phase 1, part 1 malignant pleural mesothelioma, epithelioid subtype cohort. Time on treatment with INBRX-109 was equal to or greater than 24 weeks in seven of the 19 patients (~37%). 
Based on the single agent activity observed, we initiated a chemotherapy combination cohort in malignant pleural mesothelioma with Carboplatin/Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, which is currently enrolling. We expect to announce initial data from these cohorts in late 2022. 
Future Clinical Development Plans 
We continue to investigate the therapeutic utility of INBRX-109 through a broad clinical development plan across difficult-to-treat cancers. Other future clinical development of INBRX-109 may include combinations with additional chemotherapies and potentially synergistic agents in several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We are currently conducting preclinical studies with INBRX-109 and various rational combination agents, including targeted therapeutics and apoptotic pathway modulators, aimed at guiding our future clinical plans. 
INBRX-106 AND INBRX-105
INBRX-106 is a hexavalent OX40 agonist, currently being investigated as a single agent and in combination with Keytruda, a PD-1 blocking checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. INBRX-105 is a conditional 4-1BB agonist that is currently being investigated as a single agent and in combination with Keytruda in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. 
Background on Immunotherapy
A notable recent success in cancer treatment is the approval of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies as therapeutic agents. Immune checkpoints are key mechanisms that fine-tune and control the body’s immune response. In the cancer setting, tumors have developed strategies for hijacking these checkpoints, preventing an immune response to 
the cancer and allowing the tumor cells to proliferate unchecked. Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies were developed to overcome this phenomenon by relieving immune cell inhibition, resulting in a potentially long-lasting amplification of the anti-tumor immune response. Therapies against checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1 and PD-L1, produced impressive results in clinical development, resulting in marketing approvals in a number of malignancies. 
Unmet Medical Need
Despite unprecedented clinical response rates, the majority of patients fail to respond to therapies targeting PD-1 and PD-L1. We believe this is in part because T-cells require co-stimulation for full functionality. Thus, checkpoint inhibition alone is likely insufficient to fully enable the immune system to attack a tumor, and we believe further benefit could be derived by the addition of immune co-stimulatory agents. 
We believe INBRX-106 and INBRX-105 have the potential to combine with the fast-growing immunooncology market, which currently has annual sales of over $20 billion. 
INBRX-106 
Background on OX40
OX40, a member of the TNFRSF, is predominately expressed and is a key co-stimulatory receptor on activated T-cells. Signaling through OX40 provides co-stimulation that promotes T-cell expansion, enhanced effector function and memory cell formation, and prevents activation-induced cell death. The natural mechanism of OX40 activation is via the interaction with its trimeric ligand, OX40L, which serves to effectively cluster multiple OX40 molecules and facilitate downstream signaling leading to nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, or NFkB, activation. Based on the capacity for OX40 signaling to enhance anti-tumor immunity in preclinical studies, there have been many efforts to therapeutically exploit this pathway for cancer immunotherapy. Most previously developed agents were bivalent OX40 agonists, the configuration of which we believe to be poorly suited for efficient receptor clustering, evidenced by the lack of clinical responses observed for such molecules. 
Our Solution
INBRX-106 is a precisely engineered hexavalent sdAb-based therapeutic candidate targeting OX40, designed to be an optimized agonist of this co-stimulatory receptor. As shown in the diagram below, INBRX-106 is composed of six OX40 targeting sdAbs and a functional Fc domain. 
As a hexavalent therapeutic candidate, INBRX-106 is designed to bind six OX40 molecules on the cell surface to mediate efficient receptor clustering and downstream signaling. In preclinical studies, we observed that INBRX-106 elicited superior OX40 agonism when compared to the bivalent antibodies, 1A7 (analog of MOXR-0916) or 1D10 using an OX40 expressing NFkB reporter cell line, wherein clustering of OX40 receptor mediated signaling culminated in luciferase expression. We also observed that INBRX-106 can mediate T-cell co-stimulation and reduce the suppressive activity of regulatory T-cells. Additionally, INBRX-106 is able to exploit IgG-mediated effector function via the Fc domain.
Clinical Data
We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in December 2019 for INBRX-106. This Phase 1 trial is designed as an open-label, four-part trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We expect the entire trial will be conducted at approximately 12-16 clinical sites in the United States and enroll approximately 145 patients. Primary objectives of the trial are safety and tolerability, and the determination of the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose of INBRX-106 as a single agent and in combination with Keytruda. Secondary objectives are serum exposure, immunogenicity, as measured by the frequency of anti-drug antibodies, and clinical anti-tumor efficacy per RECIST (version 1.1) and immune RECIST based on response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Exploratory objectives will include evaluation of potential predictive diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

Part 1 of the trial utilized a traditional 3+3 algorithm for single agent dose escalation from 0.0003 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in twenty patients. INBRX-106 was observed to be generally well tolerated in humans. The most common adverse effects, or AEs, reported for INBRX-106 were Grade 1 and 2 rashes or dermatitis, cytokine release syndrome, fatigue, and infusion-related reactions. Notably, cutaneous toxicities are common immune-related AEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These mostly mild or moderate and likely immune-related toxicities were in line with the mechanism of action of this candidate therapeutic. The maximum administered dose was 3 mg/kg and the MTD level was not reached. 
Part 2 of the trial, single agent dose expansion, administers INBRX-106 in two different dosing schedules to patients with tumor types responsive to checkpoint inhibitors. Utilization of extensive biomarker data guided the determination of the optimal dose for Part 2 of the trial, which we believe to be 0.03 mg/kg. Key attributes leading to the choice of this dose level included OX40 occupancy data, evidence of peripheral memory T-cell activation and proliferation, and sufficient drug clearance to allow target recovery prior to the next dose administration. Part 2 treatment cohorts of this trial, which are still ongoing, are in the following tumor types: non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and urothelial (transitional) cell carcinoma. 
In Parts 1 and 2 we have observed stable disease, per investigator assessment, of greater than six months in four out of 10 response evaluable non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma patients. Three of the four patients had previous exposure to checkpoint inhibitors and one uveal melanoma patient was checkpoint naive. The longest duration of stable disease as of January 10, 2022 was 95 weeks and ongoing in a non-small cell lung cancer patient refractory to Keytruda.
In Parts 3 and 4 of this trial, INBRX-106 is being evaluated in combination with Keytruda, a PD-1 blocking checkpoint inhibitor. In the all-comer Part 3 of the trial, INBRX-106 was escalated in combination with Keytruda and enrolled 21 patients with locally advance or metastatic solid tumors. It was observed to be well tolerated, with predominantly mild or moderate immune-related toxicities noted. The MTD was determined to be 0.1 mg/kg dosed every three weeks. Two durable partial responses with duration of greater than six months and ongoing were observed in two CPI-naive patients, one with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and one with uveal melanoma. Additionally, there was one double-digit reduction in tumor size with duration greater than four months in a cutaneous melanoma patient who had been previously exposed to checkpoint inhibitors. 
Future Clinical Development Plan
Part 4, INBRX-106 combination expansion cohorts, which initiated in December 2021, will enroll approximately 80 patients who are positive for PD-L1 expression as determined by immunohistochemistry and possessing adequate hematologic and organ function, to qualify for enrollment. Forty of these patients will be checkpoint refractory with non-small cell lung cancer and a basket of other indications. An additional 40 patients will be checkpoint naive, enrolling 10 patients in each of the following indications: cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We expect to announce initial data from the dose expansion cohorts in combination with Keytruda during the second half of 2022. 
INBRX-105 
Background on 4-1BB
4-1BB, or TNFRSF9, a member of the TNFRSF, is a promising co-stimulatory receptor that we believe can synergize with checkpoint inhibitors to address the insufficiency of checkpoint inhibition alone. 4-1BB is expressed on recently activated T-cells but is largely absent from circulating T-cells under normal conditions. Agonistic 4-1BB antibodies have exhibited anti-tumor activity in mouse models of cancer, especially in combination with other immunomodulatory or tumor targeted therapeutics. These observations motivated the clinical advancement of antibodies designed to agonize 4-1BB and co-stimulate tumor reactive T-cells. Most recently, urelumab, a 4-1BB agonist, showed initial signs of single agent therapeutic efficacy, but clinical investigation was halted due to dose-limiting liver toxicities. 
Our Solution
INBRX-105 is a precisely engineered multi-specific sdAb-based therapeutic candidate that is designed to agonize 4-1BB selectively in the presence of PD-L1, which is typically found in the tumor microenvironment and associated lymphoid tissues. PD-L1 is a validated biomarker for tumors with the potential for anti-tumor immune activation and thus we believe represents an ideal anchor antigen to drive 4-1BB agonism. The image below illustrates the unique structure of INBRX-105: 
INBRX-105: A PD-L1 Targeted 4-1BB Agonist 
We believe INBRX-105 can overcome the toxicity issues that have limited the success of prior 4-1BB agonists based on its potential to selectively activate 4-1BB + T-cells in the tumor microenvironment, and thus alter the T-cell population, and enrich for cells with anti-tumor capacity. We expect to achieve the maximal therapeutic benefit of INBRX-105 in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Our preclinical studies demonstrate that acute exposure to PD-L1 dependent 4-1BB agonism is sufficient to derive maximal anti-tumor activity when co-dosed with another PD-1 blocking agent at a target saturating dose. 
Clinical Data 
We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for INBRX-105 in the United States in February 2019. This Phase 1 trial is designed as an open-label, four-part trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and is being conducted at approximately 14-18 clinical sites in the United States. 
Primary objectives of the Phase 1 trial are safety, tolerability, and the determination of the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose of INBRX-105 as a single agent and in combination with Keytruda. Secondary objectives are serum exposure, immunogenicity, as measured by frequency of anti-drug antibodies. Exploratory objectives include clinical anti-tumor efficacy per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST (version 1.1, or v1.1), and immune RECIST based on response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, progression-free survival and overall survival, as well as evaluation of potential predictive diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

Part 1, single agent dose escalation, was completed with a total of 32 patients enrolled. We observed dose-limiting toxicities, which were consistent with immune related adverse events, such as hepatitis, arthritis and myalgia/hyperthyroidism, at several dose levels and determined the 1 mg/kg dose level as the MTD of INBRX-105. Patients in this part of the study were not pre-screened for PD-L1 expression. Eight out of 18 evaluable patients (44%), who were dosed at the 0.1 mg/kg dose level or above, achieved stable disease, with the greatest reduction in tumor volume observed to be 20% by RECISTv1.1. The longest duration on treatment with INBRX-105 was 41 weeks, or approximately nine and a half months. Notably, seven patients with stable disease tested positive for PD-L1 expression, with a minimum of 1% positivity as determined by immunohistochemistry (Range 1 to 95%), and the results of one patient are pending. Four of these eight patients were refractory to or progressed on prior PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.
Part 2, single agent dose expansion, began enrolling during the first quarter of 2021. Part 2 will enroll 32 patients in expansion cohorts in each of non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, as well as a basket cohort of gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and urothelial (transitional) cell carcinoma. Patients in the expansion cohorts for Part 2 of this trial must be positive for PD-L1 expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry, to qualify for enrollment. 
Part 3, dose escalation of INBRX-105 in combination with Keytruda, will enroll a minimum of 15 patients. These patients are not pre-screened for PD-L1 expression. We expect to announce initial data from this cohort during the second quarter of 2022. 
Future Clinical Development Plan
Part 4 of this trial will consist of INBRX-105 in combination with Keytruda, enrolling 80 patients. Approximately 60 patients will be positive for PD-L1 expression and be refractory to or have progressed on prior PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in each of the following indications: non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and a basket cohort of gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and urothelial (transitional) cell carcinoma. Additionally, we will evaluate an additional combination cohort of approximately 20 checkpoint inhibitor naive non-small cell lung cancer patients that are positive for PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion scale of between 1-49%. We expect to announce initial data from the Part 4 combination expansion cohorts during the first half of 2023.

We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new technologies and therapeutic candidates. As our business evolves, we may, among other activities, file additional patent applications in pursuit of our intellectual property strategy, to adapt to competition or to seize potential opportunities. 
The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. For example, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our therapeutic candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those therapeutic candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdiction where these are available and where we also have a patent that may be eligible; however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our technology and business not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect this intellectual property, in part, by requiring our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other service providers and 
advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or other relationship with us. In general, these agreements provide that confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements further provide that inventions and discoveries conceived or reduced to practice by the individual that are related to our business, or actual, or demonstrably anticipated, research or development, or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment, supplies, or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other service providers and advisors require them to assign, or grant us licenses to, inventions resulting from the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. 
Further, we expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions when available. 
We seek trademark protection in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions where available and when we deem appropriate. We currently have a registration for “Inhibrx” in the United States. We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our therapeutic candidates in various jurisdictions, including the United States. 
Competition 
The biotechnology industry is characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our platforms, technology, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
Any therapeutic candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our therapeutics, the ease of use and effectiveness of any complementary diagnostics and/or companion diagnostics, and price and levels of reimbursement. Our primary competitors fall into the following groups: 
•Companies developing novel therapeutics based on sdAb or alternative scaffold product candidates, including Alligator Bioscience AB, Camel-IDS N.V., Crescendo Biologics Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline plc, IGM Biosciences, Inc., Molecular Partners AG, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi S.A. and VHsquared Ltd.; 
•Antibody drug discovery companies that may compete with us in the search for novel therapeutic antibody targets, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Adimab LLC, Genmab A/S, Macrogenics, Inc., Merus N.V., MorphoSys AG, Numab Therapeutics AG, Amgen, Inc., Xencor Inc., and Zymeworks Inc.; 
•Companies developing therapeutics designed to treat AATD, including CSL Limited, Grifols, S.A., Kamada Ltd., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and Centessa Pharmaceuticals PLC; and 
•Companies developing cytokine therapeutics, including Alkermes PLC, Altor BioScience, ImmunityBio, Inc., Medicenna Therapeutics Corp., Nektar Therapeutics, Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis AG, Pandion Therapeutics, Inc., Merck & Co., Philogen S.p.A., Roche Holding AG, Rubius Therapeutics, Inc., SOTIO Biotech, Synthekine, Inc., Sanofi S.A., Xencor, Inc.
Our competitors also include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who may be developing therapeutic candidates with mechanisms similar to or targeting the same indications as our therapeutic candidates. 
The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our therapeutic candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These early stage and more established competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
Government Regulation 
Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our therapeutic candidates must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining marketing approvals in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
United States Government Regulation 
In the United States, the FDA regulates biopharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include: 
•refusal to approve pending applications; 
•withdrawal of an approval; 
•imposition of a clinical hold; 
•warning or untitled letters; 
•seizures or administrative detention of product; 
•total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
•injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
BLA Approval Processes 
The process required by the FDA before a therapeutic biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practices and other applicable regulations and guidance; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic candidate for its intended use; 
•submission to the FDA of a BLA; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the therapeutic candidate is produced to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the therapeutic candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
•FDA review and approval of the BLA. 
Preclinical Studies
Once a biopharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as 
animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Additional nonclinical testing continues even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a study protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND. 
Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner, such as any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product or therapeutic candidate. An institutional review board, or IRB, for each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. 
Phase 1-The product or therapeutic candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product or therapeutic candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
Phase 2-Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible AEs and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
Phase 3-Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a product or therapeutic candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are also Phase 3 trials but may be Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product or therapeutic candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
During the development of a new product or therapeutic candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to 
share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of “Phase 4” clinical trials. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product or therapeutic candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product or therapeutic candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product or therapeutic candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product or therapeutic candidate. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product or therapeutic candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product or therapeutic candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Although sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion, disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The NIH’s Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and the government has recently begun enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
Marketing Application Submission and FDA Review
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed descriptions of the product’s CMC, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for prescription biological or drug products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review. 
Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and the sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. This FDA review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA (for a standard review) and eight months from the date the BLA is 
submitted (for a “priority review”) because the FDA has approximately two months, or 60 days, after BLA submission to make a “filing” decision.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of a submitted BLA within 60 days of receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers these recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require the submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the biological product. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS plan. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS plan, if required. 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements and to assure the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve a BLA, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, or CRL, that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the CRL may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter to the applicant. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
Even if a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and/or testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Companion Diagnostics 
The FDA issued a final guidance document in July 2014 addressing agency policy in relation to in vitro companion diagnostic tests. The guidance explains that for some drugs and therapeutic biologics, the use of a companion diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, such as when the use of a product is limited to a specific patient subpopulation that can be identified by using the test. According to the guidance, the FDA generally will not approve such a product if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared for the appropriate indication, and accordingly the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously. However, the FDA may decide that it is appropriate to approve such a product without an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device when the drug or therapeutic biologic is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of a product with an unapproved or uncleared in vitro companion diagnostic device are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device. The FDA encourages sponsors considering developing a therapeutic product that requires a companion diagnostic to request a meeting with both relevant device and therapeutic product review divisions to ensure that the product development plan will produce sufficient data to establish the safety and effectiveness of both the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic. Because the FDA’s policy on companion diagnostics is set forth only in guidance, this policy is subject to change and is not legally binding. 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Priority Review Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
In addition, with the enactment of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product and therapeutic candidates designated by the FDA as “breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications. The FDA must take certain actions with 
respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA from the date of filing. 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Accelerated Approval Pathway 
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product or therapeutic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during 
post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product and therapeutic candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA. Lawmakers, FDA officials, and other stakeholders have recently been evaluating the accelerated approval program and have proposed potential reforms to improve certain aspects. In addition, over the past year, several oncology sponsors have voluntarily withdrawn specific indications for their drug products that were being marketed pursuant to accelerated approval, and the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence launched an initiative called Project Confirm, aimed at promoting transparency in the area of accelerated approvals for oncology indications. Scrutiny of the accelerated approval pathway is likely to continue and may lead to legislative and/or administrative changes in the future. 
Patent Term Restoration and Reference Product Marketing Exclusivity for Biological Products
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product or therapeutic candidate’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product or therapeutic candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant BLA.
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or the BPCIA, enacted in 2010, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics such as ours, which are also known as “reference biological products.” The pathway authorized under the BPCIA allows FDA to approve, under an abbreviated application, a biological product that has been shown to be highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; there also can be no clinically meaningful differences between the follow-on product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. Follow-on biological products approved for marketing using this pathway are commonly known as “biosimilars,” and companies seeking approval of biosimilar products must submit in their abbreviated BLAs data from analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials sufficient to meet the statutory standard in order to obtain FDA approval. In addition, an interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product, although to date no such products have been approved for marketing in the United States. FDA approved the first interchangeable biosimilars, including an interchangeable monoclonal antibody biosimilar, in 2021. 
The BPCIA bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after a reference biological product receives initial marketing approval. FDA also cannot accept an application for a biosimilar product that is based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product in question. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one 
must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
The BPCIA is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA and by federal judges. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation and legislative amendments. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Orphan Product Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to a therapeutic candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects either (i) fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or (ii) more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a product or therapeutic candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that product or therapeutic candidate. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. INBRX-109 has been designated an orphan product by the FDA for the treatment of chondrosarcoma.
If a product or therapeutic candidate that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the approved product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other marketing applications for the same drug for the same indication, except under limited circumstances (such as showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues), for seven years. Competitors, however, may still receive approval of either a different product for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or for the same product but for a different indication (which could then be used off-label in the orphan indication). Orphan product exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA, or if our therapeutic candidate is determined to be contained within a competitor’s approved drug for the same indication or disease. Further, if a drug designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
In addition, an orphan drug credit is available for qualifying costs incurred between the date the FDA designates a drug as an orphan drug and the date the FDA approves the drug. 
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States and, if granted, it provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the product or therapeutic candidate in children. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, the additional protection is granted if the pediatric clinical trial is deemed to have fairly responded to the FDA’s Written Request. Although the FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on either approved or unapproved indications, it may only do so where it determines that information relating to that use of a product or therapeutic candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may produce health benefits in that population. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described trials. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric trials for most therapeutic drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original new drug applications, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Sponsors must also submit Pediatric Study Plans, or PSPs, to the agency for review within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric trial or trials that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric trials along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product or therapeutic candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product and therapeutic candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. The FDA is required to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation, and the FDA publicly posts such PREA Non-Compliance letters and sponsor’s response. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although FDA has taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption in PREA by announcing that it does not intend to grant any additional orphan drug designations for rare pediatric subpopulations of what is otherwise a common disease. 
Post-Approval Requirements 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved biological product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product or therapeutic reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or therapeutic candidate, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of non-compliance include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•mandated modification of promotional materials or labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs.
Any therapeutic candidate manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things: 
•record-keeping requirements; 
•reporting of adverse experiences with the therapeutic candidate; 
•providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 
•sampling and distribution requirements; 
•notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and
•complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Therapeutic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutic products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the BLA applicant and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved biological product. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of quality control and quality assurance. 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. More recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or the DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. For example, the FDA released proposed regulations in February 2022 to amend the national standards for licensing of wholesale drug distributors by the states; establish new minimum standards for state licensing third-party logistics providers; and create a federal system for licensure for use in the absence of a State program, each of which is mandated by the DSCSA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to regulations of other jurisdictions governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our therapeutic candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA 
approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company can consider applying for marketing authorization in several European Union member states by submitting its marketing authorization application(s) under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines derived from biotechnology, orphan medicinal products, or those medicines with an active substance not authorized in the European Union on or before May 20, 2004 intended to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines containing a new active substance not authorized in the European Union on or before May 20, 2004, medicines which are highly innovative, or medicines to which the granting of a marketing authorization under the centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients at the European Union-level. The decentralized procedure provides for recognition by European Union national authorities of a first assessment performed by one of the member states. Under this procedure, an identical application for marketing authorization is submitted simultaneously to the national authorities of several European Union member states, one of them being chosen as the “Reference Member State,” and the remaining being the “Concerned Member States.” The Reference Member State must prepare and send drafts of an assessment report, summary of product characteristics and the labelling and package leaflet within 120 days after receipt of a valid marketing authorization application to the Concerned Member States, which must decide within 90 days whether to recognize approval. If any Concerned Member State does not recognize the marketing authorization on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. The mutual recognition procedure is similar to the decentralized procedure except that a medicine must have already received a marketing authorization in at least one of the member states, and that member state acts as the Reference Member State. 
As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a therapeutic candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. 
Orphan drugs in the European Union enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product, the marketing authorization holder is unable to supply sufficient quantity of the medicinal product or the marketing authorization holder has given its consent. 
The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), with a transitional period that expired on December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a trade agreement known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which went into effect on January 1, 2021. It remains to be seen how Brexit and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. We are currently evaluating the potential impacts on our business of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and guidance issued to date by the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, regarding the requirements for licensing and marketing therapeutic drugs and biologics in the United Kingdom.
Since the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom covering the quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime as it applies to medicinal products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for approved products, and coverage may be more 
limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Payment rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower cost products that are already reimbursed and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by third-party payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States, or U.S.. In the U.S., third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but they also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations. Accordingly, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. 
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic and biosimilar products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical or biological products apply to companion diagnostics.
Moreover, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a product and therapeutic candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing therapeutic pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our therapeutic candidates. Historically, therapeutic candidates launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower. 
Healthcare Reform 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product and therapeutic candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product and therapeutic candidates that obtain marketing approval. The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay marketing approval of our product and therapeutic candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. Furthermore, the next FDA reauthorization package is currently being negotiated and is due to be finalized by Congress in 2022, while several other FDA-related changes are also being proposed in Congress, including within a “Cures 2.0” bill that is likely to have bipartisan support. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing 
approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. 
For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in March 2010 and has had a significant impact on the health care industry in the U.S. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. It also included the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive healthcare provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price, or ASP, to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or have been effectively repealed through Executive Orders and/or executive agency decisions. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the Biden Administration has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA that affect health care expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The suspension was subsequently extended through March 31, 2022, with a reduction of the suspension to 1% sequester through June 30, 2022.
As another example, in December 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law, or P.L. 116-94, that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019, or the CREATES Act. The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic and biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic and biosimilar product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic and biosimilar products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic and biosimilar product developments will use this new pathway, as 
well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown.
Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The HHS has solicited feedback on some of various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out of pocket costs of drugs and implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, HHS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified an HHS policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. As another example, in 2020, the FDA finalized a rulemaking to establish a system whereby state governmental entities could lawfully import and distribute prescription drugs sourced from Canada. More recently, in July 2021, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order on promoting competition in the American economy that includes several mandates pertaining to the pharmaceutical and health care insurance industries. Among other things, the executive order directed the FDA to work towards implementing a system for importing drugs from Canada (following on the Trump administration notice-and-comment rulemaking on Canadian drug importation that was finalized in October 2020). The Biden order also called on HHS to release a comprehensive plan to combat high prescription drug prices, and it includes several directives regarding the Federal Trade Commission’s oversight of potentially anticompetitive practices within the pharmaceutical industry. The drug pricing plan released by HHS in September 2021 in response to the executive order makes clear that the Biden Administration supports aggressive action to address rising drug prices, including allowing HHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs, but such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative actions.
Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate PBMs and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services.
Other Healthcare Laws 
Our current and future business operations are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we research, and, if approved, market, sell and distribute our therapeutic candidates. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, physician sunshine and drug pricing transparency laws and regulations such as: 
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly interpreted and aggressively enforced with the result that beneficial commercial arrangements can be penalized in the healthcare industry. In the past, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on a variety of arrangements, including sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to 10 years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim 
including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act; 
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Actions under these laws may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government uses these laws, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other allegedly unlawful sales and marketing practices. If an entity is found to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory and substantial civil penalties;
•The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its accompanying regulations, or HIPAA, created new federal, civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, among other things, imposes reporting requirements on manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners), teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The law carries penalties of up to $1.15 million per year for violations, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments and relationships with with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws; 
•Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug and therapeutic biologics manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws which require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state laws and non-United States laws and regulations (particularly European Union laws regarding personal data relating to individuals based in Europe) that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Moreover, in November 2020, HHS finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute and the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the healthcare industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants.
Ensuring that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including 
monetary damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with any of these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
U.S. and European Data Security and Data Privacy Laws
HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy-related laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information” or “PHI”.
HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare providers who engage in certain standard healthcare transactions electronically, such as electronic billing, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities” under HIPAA. State imposed health information privacy and security laws typically apply based on licensure, for example, licensed providers or licensed entities are limited in their ability to use and share health information.
Additionally, all states have enacted legislation protecting the privacy and security of “personal information” such as identifiable financial or health information, social security number and credit card information. These laws overlap and apply simultaneously with federal privacy and security requirements and regulated entities must comply with all of them. The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, that went into effect January 1, 2020, is one of the most restrictive state privacy laws, protecting a wide variety of personal information and granting significant rights to California residents with respect to their personal information. Regulations under CCPA have been modified several times. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters in the election of November 3, 2020. CPRA will modify CCPA significantly, potentially resulting in further uncertainty, additional costs and expenses stemming from efforts to comply, and additional potential for harm and liability for failure to comply. Other states in the U.S. are considering privacy laws similar to CCPA. In dealing with health information for the development of our technology or for commercial purposes, we will be indirectly affected by HIPAA and state-imposed health information privacy and security laws because these laws regulate the ability of our potential customers and research collaborators to share health information with us. Additionally, we must identify and comply with all applicable state laws for the protection of personal information with respect to employee information or other personal information that the company collects. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors- We face regulation and potential liability related to the privacy, data protection and information security which may require significant resources and may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.”
In the European Union, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of personal and patient data across the healthcare industry became stronger in May 2018. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, applies across the European Union and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company’s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of such European Union based data subjects including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g., access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and the new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and are afforded greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. We may be subject to GDPR if we undertake operations in the EU, offer products or services to individuals in the EU or monitor the behavior of individuals within the EU.
We could also be subject to evolving European Union laws on data export, for transfers of data outside the European Union to us, group companies or third parties. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the European Union 
to jurisdictions that ensure an adequate level of data protection. The United States has not been deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, so in order for us to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, we must identify a legal basis for data transfer (e.g., the European Union Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses). On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union or the CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), called Schrems II. This decision (a) calls into question commonly relied upon data transfer mechanisms as between the European Union member states and the United States (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses) and (b) invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on which many companies had relied as an acceptable mechanism for transferring such data from the EU to the United States. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data importers to assess U.S. national security laws on their business and future actions of European Union data protection authorities are difficult to predict.
Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. In particular, while the Data Protection Act of 2018 that “implements” and complements the GDPR achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the European Economic Area to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR.
Other Laws and Regulations
Our present business is, and our future business may be, subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions, and other current and potential future local, state, federal, and foreign regulations. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors- If we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.”
Manufacturing 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our therapeutic candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We presently have relationships with suppliers for the manufacture of supplies for all of our required raw materials, antibodies and other biologics for our preclinical research, clinical trials, and if and when applicable, commercialization. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing relationships with these third parties. 
Human Capital Resources
Our employees are a key factor in our ability to achieve our mission to discover and develop effective biologic therapeutics for people with life-threatening conditions. We believe that our future success depends on our continued ability to identify, recruit, retain, and incentivize our management team and our clinical, scientific, and other employees. Our ability to do so depends on factors including our Company culture, compensation and benefits, growth and development opportunities, and prioritization of employee safety.
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2021, we had 112 employees, 106 of whom were full-time, 97 of whom were engaged in research and development activity, and 25 with a Ph.D. or M.D. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
Employee Conduct & Ethics
Inhibrx adopted and regularly reviews corporate policies, including a Code of Conduct and Ethics and Whistleblower Policy, which apply to all of our employees. All employees attend a mandatory public company training session and are required to abide by, review and confirm compliance to the Company’s Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics and Whistleblower Policy, as well as our Insider Trading Policy governing trading by Company personnel in the Company’s securities. We have established a Whistleblower reporting hotline to enable our employees to anonymously report any suspected violations of these policies. In addition, the Company requires employees to complete Anti-Harassment Training, with employees who work in a management capacity required to complete additional trainings in Harassment Prevention and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
Employee Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to reward and support our employees in order to continue to attract and retain top talent. Our compensation includes:
•Employee base salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and knowledge;
•Stock-based compensation awards which help to align the interests of our stockholders with those of our employees;
•Bonus award plans at the senior management level and discretionary awards for other key employees;
•Retirement savings options and matching contributions;
•Fully covered healthcare benefits for all full-time employees and their dependents;
•Unlimited vacation benefit for all full-time employees; and
•Parental leave and other leave options available to all employees.
Employee Growth and Development 
Inhibrx is committed to fostering and growing talent within the biotechnology and life sciences space. We provide internship opportunities for students interested in biotechnology and science within our research and development departments. Many of our interns have continued on to join the Company in a full-time position after graduation. Our hiring process is transparent and we are an equal opportunity employer. Many of our employees hold Ph.D.s or M.D.s; however, the Company equally commits resources to advancing all of our employees with a range of educational backgrounds. We offer tuition reimbursement aimed at growth and career development, as well as the opportunity for employees to attend relevant conferences and symposiums. In addition, we offer in-house coaching opportunities to refine or develop professional skills as our employees become managers and plan their career growth.
Employee Wellness, Health, and Safety
We are strongly committed to the health and safety of our employees and strive to maintain the highest possible level of safety in our workplace. We require annual workplace safety training to reinforce workplace safety procedures that may be useful in the event of emergency situations and to assist our employees in helping to prevent workplace accidents. Our Environmental Health and Safety Committee, which is comprised of numerous cross-departmental members, meets regularly to review workplace safety and adherence to safety policies.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a COVID-19 Task Force, which, since March 2020, has been continuously implementing changes in our business to protect our employees, support appropriate health and safety protocols, and comply with government regulations. These measures include implementing a policy for employees to work from home to the extent practicable, increased physical distancing in workspaces, and regular testing or vaccination requirements. For our essential employees who remain onsite, we provide personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning protocols. We have implemented a policy and protocols to address COVID-19 cases and potential exposure. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we adjust and tailor our approach based on applicable regulations, public health guidance, and local community case rates.
