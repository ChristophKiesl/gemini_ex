GTY brings government technology companies together to achieve a new standard in citizen engagement and resource management. GTY solutions provide public sector organizations with the ability to communicate, engage, interact, conduct business, and transact with their constituents in procurement, payments, grants management, budgeting, and permitting. 
GTY operates through the following subsidiaries: Bonfire Interactive Ltd., a Canadian company (“Bonfire” or “Procurement”) provides strategic sourcing and procurement SaaS to enable confident and compliant spending decisions; CityBase, Inc. (“CityBase” or “Payments”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Department of Better Technology, Inc.

To help attract, develop and retain personnel, we focus on a variety of factors. We design recruitment practices to attract and hire the best people in support of our business and our customers. Market-based compensation and benefits, adjusted to account for the specific states, provinces and countries in which we operate in North America and the locations of employees, facilitate retention of the right people. Training is structured to provide our people with the skills they need to succeed in a modern technology company and in serving our public sector customers. Internal development opportunities, both in our business units and at the holding company, facilitate career development and motivation of, and satisfaction from, individual contributors, management and executives. 
We were initially formed as a blank check company incorporated on August 11, 2016 as a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Until the consummation of the business combination in 2019, we neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue.
On November 1, 2016, we consummated our initial public offering of 55,200,000 units, including the issuance of 7,200,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each unit consisted of one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $552 million. Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, in August 2016, GTY Investors, LLC (the “Sponsor”) purchased 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares (“founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. On each of October 14 and October 26, 2016, we effected a share capitalization resulting in an aggregate of 11,500,000 and 13,800,000 founder shares outstanding, respectively. In October 2016, the Sponsor

transferred 25,000 founder shares to each of our independent director nominees at the same per-share purchase price paid by the Sponsor.
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 8,693,334 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, with the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $13.04 million.
Upon the closing of the initial public offering and private placement on November 1, 2016, $552 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
Initially, we were required to complete our initial business combination by November 1, 2018, which was 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. On October 30, 2018, our shareholders approved a proposal to amend our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which we had to consummate an initial business combination from November 1, 2018 to May 1, 2019. In connection with such proposal, our public shareholders had the right to elect to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for a per share price, payable in cash, based upon the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. Our public shareholders holding 34,011,538 Class A ordinary shares out of a total of 55,200,000 Class A ordinary shares validly elected to redeem their shares and, accordingly, after giving effect to such redemptions, the balance in our trust account was approximately $216.8 million.
On February 19, 2019, we consummated the business combination pursuant to which we acquired Bonfire, CityBase, eCivis, OpenCounter, Questica, and Sherpa (the “Acquisition”). Until the Acquisition, GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands (“GTY Cayman”) did not engage in any operations nor generate any revenues. 11,073,040 Class A ordinary shares were redeemed at a per share price of approximately $10.29 in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the business combination. In connection with the closing of the business combination, GTY Govtech, Inc. a Massachusetts corporation, became the parent company of and successor issuer by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to our predecessor entity, GTY Cayman, and changed its name from GTY Govtech, Inc. to GTY Technology Holdings Inc.
Upon the closing of the business combination, all outstanding Class A ordinary shares were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of common stock, and our outstanding warrants became exercisable for shares of common stock on the same terms as were contained in such warrants prior to the business combination.
Bonfire Business Overview
Bonfire, a corporation originally incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada and now a British Columbia corporation, was founded in 2012 and is a major provider of software technologies for the procurement and vendor or supplier sourcing industry across government, the broader public sector, and various highly-regulated commercial vertical markets. Bonfire offers customers and their sourcing professionals a modern SaaS application that helps find, engage, evaluate, negotiate with, and award contracts to suppliers. Bonfire delivers effective workflow automation, data collection and analysis, and collaboration to drive cost savings, compliance, and strategic outcomes.
Industry Background
The North American public sector represents a significant market for procurement technology. Procurement processes across various levels of government and public sector agencies account for an estimated 9% of gross domestic product for both the United States and Canada, which equals approximately $2.1 trillion per year for the United States and Canada combined. However, most of these spending decisions are made via manual paper processes, off-the-shelf spreadsheet technologies, and legacy internet-based sourcing portals.
In total, the North American public sector market includes over 99,000 cities, counties, towns, and other local government special agencies, and over 17,000 public institutions in academia, public healthcare, transit, utilities, and general state and federal agencies as of the most recent US Census of Governments. Despite differences in revenue sources, service delivery, and organizational mandates, each government body or entity shapes its sourcing practices in similar ways in response to state and federal procurement legislation and the emergence of various best practices.
Each public body faces a similar challenge: how to procure the best good or service, for the best cost, within often rigid compliance and policy directives from elected bodies or other regulation. This compliance- and policy-driven environment makes public sector procurement a significantly more complex and sensitive process than in the private sector. Public sector

procurement teams are typically stewards of tax-payer resources and are subjected to high sourcing scrutiny and ethics requirements. Such entities must balance competing interests like cost-savings, compliance, and quality to achieve uniquely positive outcomes.
Public sector procurement groups are more regularly transitioning tools from offline workflows to online SaaS-enabled platforms to fulfill this mandate. Legacy internet-based portals and procurement suites often fail to respect the complexities of making procurement decisions in a public sector context. Many are mere systems of record and rudimentary interface points for buyers and suppliers. Many more fail to help procurement teams with the key functionalities of managing and analyzing supplier data for optimal sourcing decisions.
Bonfire uniquely captures the complexity and depth of public sector sourcing workflows; the SaaS allows procurement teams to collect highly granular supplier data, analyze and evaluate it across discrete criteria, and ultimately help procurement teams make the best possible decision as a balance of compliance, cost-savings, quality and fit.
Products and Services
Bonfire provides a comprehensive and flexible suite of products that addresses the procurement needs of predominantly public sector customers across academia, public healthcare, local and state government, transit, utilities, and various other state and federal agencies. Bonfire derives all revenues from subscription-based SaaS.
A description of Bonfire’s suites of products and services follows:

​ | ​ 
-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
eRFx & eTendering | ● Control for requests for proposals, or RFPs or RFx, and bids, streamlining the entire sourcing workflow from posting to award 
​ | ● Vendor-friendly online portal to post opportunities and receive structured submissions 
​ | ● Evaluation tools that give deep insights into suppliers’ relative strengths/weaknesses, pricing, and other areas 
​ | ● Real-time overview of projects and key performance indicators, or KPIs 
Contracts | ● Contract information in one centralized, searchable, online platform 
​ | ● Heat-mapped calendar view, reminders and KPIs 
​ | ● Easy creation of contracts from completed projects 
Vendor Performance | ● Visibility into vendor performance 
​ | ● Configure custom surveys for end users and set a cadence to automatically send 
​ | ● Real-time insights to address issues immediately 

​
Strategy
Bonfire’s objective is to grow its revenue and earnings organically, supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions. The key components of its business strategy are to:
​

● | Provide high quality, value-added products to its customers. Central to Bonfire’s success so far has been customer satisfaction and trust. Bonfire expects that it will continue to invest heavily in customer success. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to expand its product offerings. Bonfire intends to continue to build innovative new products for its customers. These include products that leverage the data stored in customers’ networks to help customers achieve better sourcing outcomes through predictive analytics, machine learning, blockchain, intra-agency collaboration, and other next-generation technologies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand its customer base. Continued customer growth is key for Bonfire’s strategy. Bonfire plans to continue building out its direct customer acquisition strategy while adding strategic channel relationships. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attract and retain highly qualified employees. Bonfire’s business is dependent on attracting and retaining excellent managers and employees for product development, go-to-market, administrative, and support activities. Bonfire believes that its mission, scale of the opportunity, and unique culture will allow it to continue recruiting excellent staff. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Pursue selected strategic acquisitions. Where appropriate, Bonfire may make strategic acquisitions of legacy portal providers as a way of accelerating the adoption of Bonfire. This would allow Bonfire to grow revenues more rapidly than with a purely organic strategy, and to grow its supplier network and corresponding data. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales, Marketing and Customers
Bonfire markets its products and services through direct, in-house sales and marketing personnel located in Canada and the United States.
Sales of new products and services are typically generated from outbound marketing and sales campaigns, tradeshows and conferences, word-of-mouth and referrals, and thought-leadership campaigns.
Competition
Bonfire competes with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions that it provides. Many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than Bonfire’s. Many of these firms operate within a specific geographic territory or are in a narrow product or service niche. Bonfire also competes with national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than Bonfire does, including SAP Ariba. Bonfire also occasionally competes with central internal information service departments of local governments, which requires it to persuade the end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to Bonfire.
Bonfire competes on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation, technological capabilities, and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the customer. Bonfire’s ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments can be a competitive advantage. Local governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective customers use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process.
Suppliers
Substantially all the computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software, office automation software, and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of Bonfire’s SaaS systems and services are currently available from several third-party sources. Hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail. Bonfire has not experienced any significant supply problems.
Research and Development
Bonfire invests substantial resources in research and development to improve its platform and develop new products and features. Bonfire’s research and development team is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of its products.
Intellectual Property, Proprietary Rights and Licenses
Bonfire regards certain features of its internal operations, SaaS, and documentation as confidential and proprietary and relies on a combination of contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other measures to protect its proprietary intellectual property. Bonfire currently does not rely on patents. Bonfire believes that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the SaaS industry, trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability and experience of its employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of support services. Bonfire typically licenses its SaaS products under non-exclusive agreements, which are generally non-transferable.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, Bonfire had 103 full-time employees. Bonfire’s employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and Bonfire has never experienced a work stoppage. Bonfire believes that its relations with its employees are good.

Properties
Bonfire leases and occupies approximately 21,000 square feet of office space in Ontario, Canada. Such lease expires on June 30, 2022.
Government Regulation
Upon reasonable investigation, we are not aware of any current government regulations that negatively impact in a material way Bonfire’s business or ability to compete in its markets.
CityBase Business Overview
CityBase provides dynamic content, digital services, and integrated payments via a SaaS platform that includes functionality accessible via web and mobile, kiosk, point-of-sale, and other channels. CityBase SaaS integrates its platform to underlying systems of record, billing, and other source systems, and configures payments and digital services to meet the requirements of its customers. Its customers include government agencies and utility companies. CityBase, LLC was formed in Delaware on June 9, 2014. On June 21, 2016, CityBase, LLC was converted into a Delaware corporation, CityBase, Inc. To complement and expand CityBase’s technology and customer base, on August 17, 2017, CityBase acquired 100% of the equity interests of Better Technology, a Delaware corporation, in exchange for shares of CityBase common stock.
Industry Background
The government technology industry continues to be composed of many legacy technology vendors (which typically use significant customization for implementation), consulting firms, in-house development, and manual processes that have never been digitized. CityBase anticipates that government will further follow the digital transformation of the private sector as constituents will expect such digitalization, in particular given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ultimately such digitalization is expected to yield cost reductions and improved service to constituents. CityBase also expects a continued momentum amongst government staff and leaders to modernize government services. This future is not defined, but facilitated by, technology and will improve the way that people experience government.
Product and Service Offerings
CityBase provides an enterprise SaaS platform and associated payment kiosks that facilitate government and utility interactions with customers. The key elements of its products and services are digital services and payments.
Digital Services
CityBase’s digital services make it easier for constituents to register, apply, search, and pay for government and utility services — and easier for staff to administer these services. “Digital services” includes solutions that address the common interactions that people have with the government or their utility provider, which often remain paper based. CityBase digital services include configurable digital forms and case management tools that replace manual processes or improve existing online processes for government and utility customers. CityBase’s digital service tools help government and utility staff process constituent requests faster and more effectively.
Payments
The CityBase platform helps local governments and utilities accept, track, and manage payments from their constituents. CityBase facilitates payments that provide a modern user experience, integrate seamlessly with its customers’ existing systems, and are consistent across a large enterprise. The payment technology is available via channels, including web and mobile web, kiosk, and point-of-sale terminals. Its revenue management solution allows customers to manage system-wide payment activity as well as reconcile to individual transactions in one place.
Customers
CityBase’s customers include local and county governments and investor or municipal utility companies. Four of CityBase’s customers accounted for approximately 70% and 75% of CityBase’s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Competition
The market for enterprise payment, data analytics, and communication platforms for local governments and utilities is competitive and evolving. CityBase faces competition from several types of internal approaches and independent providers:

● | Custom software or SaaS solutions developed by outside consultants or through internal efforts to provide partial- or full-suite offerings;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Software or SaaS vendors that have developed agency- or utility-specific systems for individual business cases, such as property tax payments, utility payments, or freedom of information requests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other SaaS solution providers; and
--+-----------------------------------


● | Payment processing solution vendors serving government and utilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive factors in CityBase’s market may include the following:

● | Service
--+--------


● | Price
--+------


● | Speed to implement
--+-------------------


● | Citizen-centric design
--+-----------------------


● | Configurability and flexibility
--+--------------------------------


● | Back-office function for payment and banking reconciliation
--+------------------------------------------------------------

CityBase believes that it compares favorably on the basis of these factors. Some of CityBase’s current competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater resources to devote to research and development, a broader range of products and services, larger marketing budgets, more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships, and/or longer operating histories, greater name recognition and other resources.
Government Regulation
As a contractor to various government agencies, CityBase is subject to certain restrictions in how it operates. Such restrictions may exist at the individual customer level and may include regulations that govern the fees that CityBase collects for its services or the ability of the government counterparty to terminate its contractual obligations.
Privacy and Data Security
In addition, as a facilitator of credit card payments, CityBase is subject to privacy and data protection laws and payment card industry best practices. CityBase is a Payment Card Industry Level-1 compliant service provider hosted in an Amazon Web Services cloud environment. CityBase takes a number of important measures to promote data privacy and data security, including adhering to the standards and requirements, as defined by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, using tokenization, employing 24/7 fraud and tamper detection, real-time alerting, end-to-end encryption technology, and regularly scheduled internal and external penetration testing.
Research and Development
CityBase invests substantial resources in research and development to improve its platform and develop new products and features. CityBase’s research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of its products and platform.

Intellectual Property
The success of CityBase depends, in part, on its ability to protect its brands and technologies against infringement and misappropriation. CityBase relies on a combination of contractual restrictions, confidentiality procedures, trade secret laws and other measures to protect its proprietary intellectual property. CityBase does not currently own any patents or hold other intellectual property registrations to protect its intellectual property.
CityBase uses certain intellectual property licensed from third parties, including software made available to the public under open-source licenses. If any proprietary software does not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, CityBase believes that alternative software would be available, if necessary.
CityBase cannot be certain that its products and services do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent claims against CityBase are successful, it may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue or modify certain products or services that are found to infringe another party’s rights.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, CityBase had 80 full-time employees. CityBase also uses independent contractors to support certain technical and other functions, including implementation engineers, which assist on all phases of the web-based project lifecycle, from project definition through implementation.
CityBase employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement, and CityBase has never experienced a work stoppage. CityBase believes that its relations with its employees are good.
eCivis Business Overview
eCivis provides cloud-based grants management and cost allocation SaaS for state, local and tribal governments and other government entities. eCivis helps thousands of public agencies maximize their grant revenues, track financial and program performance, prepare cost allocation plans and budgets, and distribute federal and state grant aid to local communities. eCivis’s grants management solutions simplify grant pursuance, proposal development, budgeting, program implementation, performance, reporting, compliance and management of direct recipients and subrecipients in one single centralized enterprise system. eCivis was founded in Pasadena, California in 2000 with the help of local government leaders at the International City/County Management Association. 
Industry Background
eCivis has identified a major inefficiency in the flow of government funding between state and federal government and businesses, individuals and various local government entities. The grant funding process is inefficient, with the majority of state, local, and tribal governments lacking essential human and technical resources to pursue and manage the grant process. Instead, staff members without formal training often attempt to fit grants management into their already heavy workload, without access to standardized forms, tools or processes, resulting in inefficient strategy and lost opportunities for funding. Data and information are rarely standardized and is entered into common back-office tools such as spreadsheets and outdated grant management systems without comprehensive tracking and integration functions. Furthermore, currently existing fund management systems may be unable to monitor the proper use of funds, leading to potential mismanagement and even risk of loss and misappropriation of funds. Competitive grants are time sensitive and require immediate attention whereas procurement and internal sources take time to be approved. eCivis provides products and services that can be deployed quickly and with little technical support to address the time sensitive nature of these grant funds. 
eCivis’s Products and Services
The eCivis grants management solution consists of three core cloud-based products including eCivis Grants Network®, a full lifecycle grants management solution consisting of grants acquisition, grantee management, and grantor management SaaS, eCivis AllocateTM, a cost allocation solution, and FundMaxTM, a full-service solution designed to maximize federal and non-federal funds, including maximizing cost reimbursements using a suite of innovative digital tools and expert support. eCivis also offers implementation services including data integration, grants data migration, project management, and change management. Additionally, eCivis provides ongoing grants management training and cost allocation plan development and consulting.

eCivis Grants Network; Grants Acquisition SaaS
eCivis Grants Network; Grantee Acquisition SaaS provides customers with the ability to manage the entire planning and grant pursuance process by integrating each step from project creation to grant award, so that stakeholders can eliminate unnecessary steps and systems required to secure the right funding for their projects. Users can determine grant award eligibility and financial requirements, create and track projects requiring funding, track goals and objectives for funding, and assign various metrics to review and track organizational performance. The platform provides customers with the ability to search for federal, state and foundation grants, all identified, analyzed and summarized by eCivis’s full-time professional research staff. Such grants can be searched with an easy-to-use advanced multi-factor search engine and reviewed via organized standard tabs to effectively identify the most relevant grants. Users can review application files and e-mail grants to internal and external recipients, as well as save or assign grants to internal projects. Built-in compliance tools help determine and confirm whether internal proposals and costs align with applicable federal and non-federal guidelines.
eCivis Grants Network; Grantee Management SaaS
eCivis Grants Network Grantee Management SaaS Solution allows users to manage the entire grant process, from sourcing grant application to closeout as a grantee. Some of the key features of the Grants Management SaaS solution include the ability to organize projects and grants by organizational departments, review an enterprise-wide view of all grant activities, and access advanced workflows and robust management reporting systems. Users can build and save template reports for internal and external reporting, setup required tasks at various post-award stages, integrate project tasks with e-mail calendars, manage the communication and approval of budget amendments, and access a myriad of other features and functions. Users are also able to organize and connect financial data to and from enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) and general ledger against grant budgets using data integration functions — over thirty data integrations with government ERP and general ledger are provided to serve this function. Additionally, eCivis also maps compliance requirements into standard available actions across the entire grant lifecycle, and provides a library of resource that can be accessed at any time to understand 2 CFR 200 guidelines.
eCivis Grants Network; Grantor Management SaaS
eCivis Grants Network; Grantor Management SaaS provides grantors and its applicants and grantees with the opportunity to interact with each other in a modern and scalable platform. Grant portals historically, and to some extent continuing today, have not been built to make the experience great for the grantor and the grantee. A grantor solution will track performance history, organize reimbursement requests, streamline communication, manage reporting requirements to support payments to deliver transparency of all grantee activities across all of your departments and agencies. Some of the key features of this platform include the ability to create and track grant solicitation, score and record decisions on applicants, check eligibility data, track application history, track and share performance metrics for grant goals and objectives, allocate and track multiple funding sources, track pre-award grant activity by department, project, Category of Federal Domestic Assistance, and other categories.
eCivis Allocate; Cost Allocation SaaS
eCivis Allocate tracks and compares expenditures and allocation basis by fiscal years, and provides a concise methodology for budgeting and program delivery planning. The platform allows users to maximize efficiency by minimizing time spent entering and reviewing data and producing cost and plans reports, maximize grant and program funding through cost recovery and allocation, provide a clear and concise methodology to assist in developing budgets and planning program delivery, and determine full, defensible, indirect costs to include in indirect cost rate proposals, hourly rates, user fees, and claims for reimbursement under California Senate Bill 90.
eCivis FundMax; Cost Allocation SaaS
eCivis FundMax is a full-service solution designed to maximize federal and non-federal funds, including maximizing cost reimbursements using a suite of innovative digital tools and expert support. The reimbursements from FundMax can generate the required funding to properly implement and utilize eCivis solutions.

Consulting and Training
eCivis’s team of experienced consultants and support staff provide training to improve planning, acquisition and effective management of federal and non-federal grants. Further, eCivis’s strategic grant development and grant writing service helps stakeholders develop a comprehensive solution leading to sustainable grant success by helping customers, among other things: (i) thoroughly understand key initiatives and internal projects eligible for grant funding, (ii) research grants that align to internal initiatives and organizational priorities to fill existing gaps, (iii) access organizational capacity to apply for grants successfully, (iv) align internal procurement processes and resources to pursue grant opportunities in a more efficient and effective way, and (v) draft grant proposals and provide strategic advice and consulting services to shape priorities per grant funding notices. Finally, the platform also offers a wide array of expert guides and other resources to its users.
Revenues, Sales and Marketing
eCivis derives its revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. No single contract or customer represents a disproportionate percentage of revenue. eCivis’s subscription services revenue primarily consists of fees that provide customers access to either its grant management or cost allocation cloud applications. Such subscriptions are typically one to three years in length, and are priced based on a number of factors, including the number of users having access to the products and the number of products purchased by the customer. eCivis’s professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for data integration with the customer’s systems and the eCivis grant management application, migration of grants, training, and various grant consulting services. 
eCivis focuses its sales and marketing efforts towards local, state and tribal governments and sells its solution to this market primarily through its direct sales force. The length of its sales cycle depends on the size of the potential customer and contract, as well as the type of solution or product being purchased. The sales cycle of its state government customer is generally longer than that of its local government customers. As eCivis has continued to focus on increasing its average contract size and selling more advanced products and, as a result, its sales cycle has lengthened and become less predictable, which could cause variability in results for a particular period. Additionally, the nature, complexity and extent of its implementations also have increased, which has increased and may further increase eCivis’s professional services revenues as a percentage of its overall revenues.
Research and Development
eCivis invests substantial resources in research and development to improve its platform and develop new products and features. eCivis’ research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of its products and platform.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, eCivis had 68 full-time employees. eCivis also employs independent contractors to support grant services, web development, research publishing and editing, fit-gap analysis, change management, implementation services and marketing. eCivis’s employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and eCivis has never experienced a work stoppage. eCivis believes that its relations with its employees are good.
Intellectual Property
eCivis does not own any patents. eCivis owns the registered trademarks: “ECIVIS” and “GRANTS NETWORK” .
Government Regulation
Upon reasonable investigation, we are not aware of any current government regulations that negatively impact in a material way eCivis’s business or ability to compete in its markets.
OpenCounter Business Overview
OpenCounter builds SaaS to streamline municipal permitting and licensing. The company markets permit discovery portals, which help constituents to learn about permit requirements and costs, as well as permit and licensing intake forms, 

12




which allow constituents to apply and pay for permits online. By automating the permit discovery and permit application steps, these tools reduce the need for in-person meetings, and streamline the review and approval process for agency staff. 
OpenCounter’s Products and Services
OpenCounter offers the following permit discovery portals and applications:
●The Business Portal helps entrepreneurs understand the costs and complexity of establishing a business in a particular jurisdiction. The tool aims to provide a comprehensive picture of permitting requirements. 
●The Residential Portal educates homeowners about the rules and regulations regarding residential additions, alterations, and new construction to help plan projects and remain in compliance with city code enforcement.
●The Special Events Portal helps applicants understand the process involved in hosting a special event in a public space by handling site selection, cost estimation, and event scheduling. 
●ZoningCheck shows applicants where a particular project is permitted, conditionally permitted, or prohibited according to the local zoning code.  This helps applicants to understand where their project is allowed and reduces the risk of projects moving forward in areas that are not zoned for the use. ZoningCheck is often paired with the Business, Residential and Special Events Portals, although it is also offered as a stand-alone product. 
●Online Applications allow applicants to apply and pay for permit and license applications online. Incoming applications are routed to agency staff for review and approval. Approved permits are issued electronically through the tool.

As part of the deployment of these products, OpenCounter also offers configuration services to set up and maintain the portals and applications on behalf of municipal customers.
Competition
There are a number of companies that offer permitting and licensing software or SaaS to municipal governments. These include Accela, Infor, and Tyler, among others. These companies built their software with an emphasis on the requirements of city staff users, with a lesser emphasis on the applicant experience.
By focusing on the applicant experience, OpenCounter found a unique niche in the market: enabling an intuitive, user-friendly experience of a complex regulatory process. While competitors allow applicants to submit permit and license applications online, their SaaS typically assumes that the applicant knows which permits and licenses are required, and the costs of those permits and licenses. In contrast, OpenCounter’s SaaS guides the applicant through the permit discovery process by calculating the impact of applicable zoning regulations on the choice of location and planned use, the permits required for the project, and the necessary permit fees. OpenCounter’s SaaS also alerts applicants about the professional licensure requirements for specific permits, such as whether a licensed contractor, electrician or plumber is needed on their project team. By automating these determinations, OpenCounter has addressed an in-person step referred to as a “pre-application meeting,” which is a time-consuming step for both applicants and city staff.
Because OpenCounter is offered as a SaaS solution, its annual pricing is significantly lower than the legacy systems, which have traditionally been on-premise software under perpetual license agreements.
Some of OpenCounter’s competition provide educational products that explain the permitting process in general terms. While helpful, these materials do not provide information tailored to specific project details. For example, a restaurant with outdoor seating, live entertainment, and alcohol service may require a different set of permits (with higher costs), than one without those options. Many cities offer PDF documents with this kind of information. For example, San Francisco and Los Angeles offer detailed “Business Portals,” but they are still based on templates.
By focusing on permit discovery, OpenCounter has remained agnostic to the back-end systems used by cities. This means that we can launch OpenCounter products in cities using Accela, Infor, or Tyler, and other competitors, without coming into direct competition with offerings from those companies.

Questica’s Products and Services
Questica has four primary products: (i) Budget; (ii) Performance; (iii) OpenBook®; and (iv) BudgetBook powered by CaseWare.
Budget
Questica’s Budget is a web-based, multi-user budgeting preparation and management solution that provides all budgeting SaaS requirements in one easy-to-access place. Budget is a comprehensive, streamlined budgeting SaaS product that enables users to improve and shorten an organization’s budgeting cycle by ensuring an accurate and collaborative multi-user budgeting process.

OpenBook
Questica’s OpenBook is a data visualization SaaS that enables the presentation of financial and non-financial data with descriptive text, informational pop-ups, charts and graphs and includes fast information search functionality. OpenBook, which can integrate with Budget, can display capital infrastructure projects on a map, including the budget data, actual spend, funding sources and accompanying documentation, images, video and other multimedia assets. By facilitating the sharing and communication of financials and other data, OpenBook is used by organizations to communicate strategic plans, fundraising and community initiatives, disclose to citizens how tax dollars are spent, and engage with stakeholders regarding plans, projects and issues. Organizations can also link related activities to showcase the depth and scope of capital projects that are happening in a city, region, state, province or country.
Budget Book powered by CaseWare
Questica’s Budget Book powered by CaseWare is a user-friendly and comprehensive document management and financial reporting tool that allows government agencies to create, collaborate, edit, approve and publish annual budget books. Budget Book integrates with Budget and leverages CaseWare's flexible, comprehensive, and automated Public Sector Accounting Board reporting software solution. The budget book standards for the Government Financial Officers Association’s annual Distinguished Budget Presentation Award were used to develop the standard budget book preparation model for Budget Book’s interface, permitting agencies to easily prepare professional and compliant budget books that are often very time and resource intensive to produce.
Competition
The competitive landscape for budgeting SaaS, software, performance management, and transparency and data visualization solutions varies depending on the type of solution, the size of the organizations to be served and the geographical locations in which such organizations operate, but in most cases the solutions with which Questica competes are ERP solutions, Microsoft’s Excel and home-grown solutions designed by the organizations themselves.
Questica believes the principal competitive factors in its markets include:

● | Cost
--+-----


● | Technology
--+-----------


● | User Interface
--+---------------


● | Customer Service
--+-----------------


● | Integration
--+------------


● | Public Sector Focus and Expertise
--+----------------------------------


● | Product Breadth
--+----------------


● | Implementation Track Record
--+----------------------------

Questica believes that it competes favorably based on these factors.
While there are a number of competitors seeking to provide such solutions, the primary competitors include Oracle’s Hyperion Planning, ClearGov, Public Sector Digest Software, MyBudgetFile, Allovue Balance, Adaptive Insights (Workday), Kaufman Hall, OpenGov and Centage’s Budget Maestro, which each competes to differing degrees across the spectrum of organizations, geographical locations and vertical markets in which Questica operates. Questica has emerged as a market leader or strong market participant for each type of solution that it provides among these primary competitors.
Questica has focused on establishing relationships with potential customers as early in the process as possible through cold calling, email campaigns, trade show attendance and sponsorships, web marketing, referrals and Questica-sponsored regional events. Questica leverages existing customer references and its broad knowledge and understanding of the public 

15




sector and the unique budgeting challenges these customers face to compete with its primary competitors. Questica additionally differentiates itself by solely focusing its product development on the public sector and does not sell or market its products into any other types of customers.
Questica has a sales organization that sells its products, sometimes working with companies that sell complimentary solutions and refer customers to Questica. In addition, Questica uses distributors that sell, implement and provide basic support services to customers and has a number of referral arrangements with companies that introduce Questica’s products to their customers and receive referral fees for Questica contracts.
Questica is not dependent on any one customer, and no customer represented more than 10% of total revenues during each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Research and Development
Questica invests substantial resources in research and development to improve its platform and develop new products and features. Questica’s research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of its products and platform.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, Questica had 113 full-time employees. Questica’s employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and Questica has never experienced a work stoppage. Questica believes that its relations with its employees are good.
Intellectual Property
Questica does not hold any patents but has registered trademarks in the U.S. and Canada for “QUESTICA”, “OPENBOOK”, and “WHERE BRILLIANT BEGINS”.
Government Regulation
Upon reasonable investigation, we are not aware of any current government regulations that negatively impact in a material way Questica’s business or Questica’s ability to compete in the markets it pursues. However, there are regulations related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) that are relevant to Questica’s customers that could in the future necessitate changes to Questica’s products to be compliant, and if not addressed, could negatively impact Questica’s ability to compete for new business.
Sherpa Business Overview
Sherpa is a leading provider of public sector budgeting SaaS, perpetual license software and consulting services that help state and local governments create and manage budgets and performance. Customers purchase the right to use Sherpa’s SaaS or perpetual license software and engage Sherpa consulting services to configure the SaaS or software and train customers.  Following the implementation, customers continue to use the SaaS or software while paying maintenance or subscription fees.
Sherpa’s customers benefit from a system that simplifies the budgeting process, encourages collaboration and provides detailed projections on substantial portions of their budgets. Increased access to data, including instant aggregation of the budget requests, means customers can spend more time analyzing data and less time collecting it and formatting outputs. Sherpa’s business consulting provides access to lessons learned from over 150 public sector budgeting implementations and consultants with a median of 22 years of experience in budgeting and performance management.
Sherpa’s contracts are composed of three types: (i) short-term services contracts for software implementation of three to twelve months; and (ii) on-going maintenance of one-to-five year renewable periods; and (iii) optional full service maintenance, which offers clients full system administration functions, renewable annually. Due to the investment made in implementing the SaaS or perpetual license software and the quality of the solution and support, retention rates are very high.

Industry Background
Public sector budgeting has been traditionally performed by either spreadsheet that are compiled by a central office or home-grown systems. Due to the sheer amount of data and publication requirements needed by public sector organizations, using this traditional process can be challenging. Most budget processes experience a significant amount of data re-entry and re-stating, manual compilation and extensive data verification and often rely on a mostly manual preparation of required publications. While products that meet some budgeting software or SaaS requirements exist in the market, many are overly complicated to implement, priced at a point that exceeds the reservation points of most government organizations, or were built for private sector functions. Sherpa’s product is flexible enough to meet complex requirements while also scalable to lower budget customers.
Sherpa’s Products and Services
Sherpa provides public sector SaaS or perpetual license budgeting software to meet the needs of key stakeholders, executive and legislative branches, budget offices and department users. The key elements of Sherpa’s offerings are: (i) a highly configurable SaaS or perpetual license software; (ii) an experienced consulting team; and (iii) a long-term support model.
Highly Configurable SaaS and Software
Sherpa’s SaaS and software were designed to be configured by functional staff with no changes to the underlying code. Implementation teams are comprised of functional experts, not technical experts, who are able to understand business requirements and demonstrate configured SaaS or software immediately after requirements meetings. This means customers see their future solution throughout the process and can make refinements without having to wait for an entire build phase to complete.
Consulting
The members of Sherpa’s consulting team have a median of 22 years of targeted public sector budgeting experience and together have implemented over 150 public sector budgeting projects. This experience is invaluable to customers for several reasons. Customers can quickly explain their processes and Sherpa’s team will understand without multiple iterations, meaning customers dedicate a significantly lower amount of their time to engagements. When customers seek advice, Sherpa can refer them to dozens of relevant examples where other similar customers have faced similar challenges. Sherpa has many innovative customers whose collective thought leadership is channeled through Sherpa’s implementation team. Sherpa’s team has seen what has worked and what has not, so Sherpa can offer counsel on business processes redesign, including recommended timing relative to the SaaS or software project.
Support
Sherpa’s support model is designed to enable customers to use Sherpa’s SaaS or software for the long term, traversing changes in economic conditions, leadership, policy, and staff. As part of Sherpa’s basic maintenance model, customers can reach out to their consulting team at any time to get assistance, answers to questions or support with activities that are rarely done, such as annual rollovers. This results in customers getting answers to questions immediately, without the struggles of reporting issues through a chain of support staff who are not familiar with the customer processes and configuration.
Revenues
Sherpa currently earn revenues from three main sources: (i) consulting services for implementations and business process design; (ii) SaaS and software fees; and (iii) maintenance fees. Consulting services are composed of one-time implementation fees and system administrator services, where Sherpa serves as the customer’s system administrator, typically to provide coverage in stretched budget offices or to cover turnover. Software fees are made up of both perpetual license fees and subscription fees. Maintenance fees are annual fees paid by perpetual license customers to have access to customer support and software upgrades.  Hosting services are also provided but are mostly pass-through to Sherpa’s hosting providers. Sherpa generally relies on approximately 30 customers for each of its three main revenue sources in a given fiscal year, which are mostly comprised of state and local governments.

Sales and Marketing
Sherpa’s primary method of securing sales to date is through responses to requests for proposals.  In addition, Sherpa’s target audience actively communicates with similar public sector organizations, which leads to word-of-mouth sales. To grow sales beyond responses to requests for proposals and word-of-mouth referrals, Sherpa employs the following sales and marketing strategies:

● | Limited conferences where decision-makers attend;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Collaboration with leading ERP vendors;
--+----------------------------------------


● | Pre-sales work to introduce customers to Sherpa’s offering; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Selling via cooperative agreements.
--+------------------------------------

Revenue Growth
Sherpa’s primary focus for revenue growth is to ensure Sherpa’s current customer base maintains a high degree of customer satisfaction.  Sherpa believes that high retention of recurring revenue is critical to create the foundation for revenue growth. Sherpa also believes that high customer satisfaction provides secondary benefits, including strong references and willingness to promote the product and team.
Growing Existing Markets
Sherpa’s goals for growth focus on verticals with which Sherpa has had the most success: cities, counties and states. Sherpa’s targeted market of large, complex customers has a total available market of 450 counties, 300 cities, 49 states and 600 state agencies. There are also a large number of K-12 opportunities, which Sherpa pursues selectively due to their unique requirements.
New Markets
There are additional verticals where Sherpa’s product applies, such as federal government agencies which may be considered for long-term growth.
Technology and Operations
Sherpa’s technology leverages Microsoft’s widely used SQL Server, which is a relational database management system, and .NET software framework.  The power of Sherpa’s application is derived from Sherpa’s investment in on-screen configuration, all of which is stored in the database, meaning code updates do not have customer-specific features. Since each customer has unique requirements which must be met due to statutory requirements or policy, Sherpa’s solution was built to be flexible enough to meet these requirements without code changes or customer customizations. With Sherpa’s experience with multiple other budgeting systems, Sherpa’s product was built from the ground up with the specific focus on how to create outputs in an efficient manner.  Reports are fast and easy to create due to the strong design.
Sherpa’s technology infrastructure for hosted customers is provided by Amazon Web Services and is maintained by Sherpa’s vendor at Smart Panda Labs. We have multiple hosting sites. Approximately one-third of Sherpa’s customer base is serviced on-premises. Sherpa’s objective is to provide uninterrupted service 24 hours per day and seven days a week, and Sherpa’s operations maintain extensive backup, security and disaster recovery procedures.
Sherpa’s solutions are scalable and can be set up quickly for new customers. The average time to stand up a new environment is less than one day. Due to low incidences of system issues, most customers take upgrades only once per year, allowing them to complete their budget cycle uninterrupted.

Competition                             
Nearly every competitive request for proposals in the budget space will have five or more bidders. Historically, very few are truly competitive across all scoring areas. Sherpa believes that the principal factors upon which its businesses compete are:

● | SaaS and Software capabilities — Sherpa’s SaaS and software generally meets over 98% of requirements
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementation team experience — Sherpa’s team members have extensive, targeted experience
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support model — Sherpa’s customers have direct contact with Sherpa’s implementation team without a tiered support model
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | References — References are strong, with surveys resulting in a 9.9/10 average score
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Price — Sherpa is generally in the 50th percentile in pricing among competitors for large to mid-sized customers
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sherpa believes Sherpa competes favorably with respect to all of the above-listed factors. Sherpa’s main competitors are much larger than Sherpa and have an advantage in name recognition.  However, Sherpa believes that in public sector budgeting most decision makers are focused on procuring the best possible product and rarely factor in company size once they are satisfied with the long-term prospects of the offering.
All of Sherpa’s prospective customers have preexisting financial and human resources solutions, meaning that Sherpa also faces competition with legacy product offerings. Companies such as Infor, Workday, SAP and Oracle have a substantial market share of financial and human resources software and SaaS, which means they can up-sell their products, often without formal procurements. Sherpa has found, however, that most customers are not satisfied with enterprise resource planning budget products and are moving to best-in-breed for products such as budgeting, grants and strategic sourcing.
Sherpa’s primary competitors in the market vary by customer size:

● | Large, complex customers with over $10 billion in budget; competitors are larger, established companies such as Questica, Oracle, SAP and CGI. Integrators include Grant Thornton, Deloitte, Accenture, Ernst and Young.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mid-sized customers with between $1 billion to $10 billion in budget; Questica and lower-priced integrators of expensive products such as Oracle or scaled-down offerings of the more expensive products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Smaller customers with less than $1 billion in budget: Sherpa enters this space selectively, but there is more competition at this level due to price sensitivity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development
Sherpa invests substantial resources in research and development to improve its platform and develop new products and features. Sherpa’s research and development organization is primarily responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of its products and platform.

As of December 31, 2021, Sherpa had 15 employees. Sherpa also employs independent contractors to support Sherpa’s hosting environments. Sherpa’s employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and Sherpa has never experienced a work stoppage. Sherpa believes that its relations with its employees are good.
Government Regulation
Upon reasonable investigation, we are not aware of any current government regulations that negatively impact in a material way Sherpa’s business or ability to compete in its markets. However, there are regulations related to HIPAA and the ADA that are relevant to Sherpa’s customers that could in the future necessitate changes to Sherpa’s products to be compliant, and if not addressed, could negatively impact Sherpa’s ability to compete for new business.
