Item 1. Business.
Overview



We intend to capitalize on the approximately 70 years of combined experience of our co-founders, Gary D. Cohn and Clifton S. Robbins, in investing and managing capital across markets and industries, structuring transactions, and building businesses, and on their respective and complementary vast and unique global networks of relationships to source and diligence transaction opportunities and add post-transaction value. Our founders have enjoyed a longstanding personal and professional relationship spanning more than twenty years and share a common vision for investing and building world class businesses. Our founders bring highly complementary capabilities across private equity, public market investing, hedge funds, investment banking and financial services, venture capital and government. Through their respective careers they have worked with founders, boards and management teams of companies operating across a broad range of industries in various stages of their life cycles and with enterprise values ranging from micro-cap to the largest in the Fortune 500, including particular and sustained focus on middle market companies.



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on July 13, 2020. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). We may pursue an initial Business Combination target in any industry or geographic location. Our sponsor is Cohn Robbins Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (our “Sponsor”).



Our registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on September 8, 2020. On September 11, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 82,800,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), including 10,800,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments (the “Over-Allotment Units”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $828.0 million, and incurring offering costs of $46,191,135, inclusive of $28,980,000 in deferred underwriting commissions.



Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 12,373,333 warrants (each a “Private Placement Warrant” and collectively, the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our Sponsor (the “Private Placement”), generating gross proceeds of $18,560,000.



Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, $828.0 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in United States government treasury bills, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by us, until the earliest of: (i) the completion of an initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our shareholders, as described below.



Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted and excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). We will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.

We intend to effectuate a Business Combination using the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. We have not engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we complete a Business Combination, and we have not generated any operating revenue to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. Our entire activity from inception through December 31, 2021 related to our formation, the preparation for the Initial Public Offering, and following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



We will provide the holders of the Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (initially $10.00 per Public Share), including any interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to certain limitations. The per-share amount to be distributed to the Public Shareholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we pay to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants.



We have until September 11, 2022 to consummate a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). However, if we have not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to fund our working capital requirements (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining Public Shareholders and our Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.



Proposed SAZKA Business Combination



On January 20, 2022, we, SAZKA Entertainment AG, a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) (“SAZKA”), Allwyn Entertainment AG, a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) (“Swiss NewCo”), Allwyn US HoldCo LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Swiss NewCo (“US HoldCo”), and Allwyn Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of US HoldCo (“DE Merger Sub”), entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”).



The Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (together, the “SAZKA Business Combination”) were approved by the boards of directors of each of our Company, Swiss NewCo and SAZKA, respectively, and by the members of US HoldCo and DE Merger Sub. The consummation of the proposed SAZKA Business Combination is subject to certain conditions further described in the Business Combination Agreement.

Business Combination Criteria



Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. If the proposed SAZKA Business Combination is not consummated, we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:

● | Have a strong position within their industry with identified competitive advantages, established customer relationships and barriers to entry; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have a strong management team that can benefit from our founders’ expertise and networks to help source additional deal flow, executives, board members, operators, partners and capital providers; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Can benefit from being a public company with access to broader capital markets to help achieve the company’s business strategy and capital structure needs; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are undervalued, with sub-optimal capital structures where our capital and corporate finance expertise can provide a solution to unlock value; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Present unique dynamics and needs under current ownership providing an opportunity for our founders to utilize their structuring expertise and investment experience to negotiate an attractive transaction; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are in the midst of undergoing a change in strategy, adapting to evolving industry dynamics or evaluating other transformational initiatives where we believe our expertise and capital can help accelerate execution and result in an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Illustrate attractive earnings and growth potential and operate in an industry with positive trends and growth dynamics; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Have been able to withstand and adapt to recent economic and market volatility, or have a path to do so. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial Business Combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.



In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.



Additional Disclosures



Our Acquisition Process



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also call upon our founders’ networks of relationships with CEOs, board members and members of executive management teams, to provide specialized insights into their areas of expertise, and utilize our operational and capital planning experience.



Each of our directors and officers directly or indirectly own Founder Shares (as defined in Part II, Item 5) and/or Private Placement Warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.





4







Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, including the proposed SAZKA Business Combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we renounce our interest in any Business Combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.



Initial Business Combination



The rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) require that our initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.



We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our Public Shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target business or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial Business Combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.

Competition



We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for Business Combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant experience with completing Business Combinations. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and sale of the Private Placement Warrants, if the proposed SAZKA Business Combination is not consummated, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we are obligated to pay cash for our Class A ordinary shares, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination.
Human Capital Management



Other than Mr. Robbins who intends to devote substantially all of his business time to our company, we do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on the status of the proposed SAZKA Business Combination and, if the proposed SAZKA Business Combination is not consummated, whether a different target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the current stage of the Business Combination process.
