Item 1. Business
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination.
Provident Acquisition Holdings Ltd., our sponsor, has been formed by seasoned investors, two of whom are affiliated with Provident Growth and Provident Capital (as defined below, collectively with Provident Growth, “Provident Group”). Provident Growth is a leading growth stage fund focused on technology investments in Southeast Asia. Established in 2018, Provident Growth has deep expertise in investing and building high growth technology businesses in Southeast Asia and has one of the largest portfolio of technology unicorns (in terms of the number of investments) among Southeast Asia-focused private equity funds (excluding venture capital funds and sovereign wealth funds). Established in 2004, Provident Capital Indonesia and its affiliates (“Provident Capital”) are a group of Southeast Asia-focused investment firms with a focused investment approach of investing substantial funds in businesses where strong management capabilities have been built within the groups.
Company History
On October 28, 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,750,000 Class B ordinary shares (our “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. Our founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a business combination. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares upon completion of the initial public offering (the “IPO”).
On January 12, 2021, we completed our IPO of 23,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “units”), generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000. Each unit consists of one of the Company’s shares of Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
Substantially concurrently with the completion of the IPO, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 6,600,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $6,600,000 in the aggregate. A total of $230,000,000, comprised of $225,400,000 of the proceeds from the IPO, including $8,050,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount, and $4,600,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
On February 23, 2021, we announced that, commencing March 1, 2021, holders of the 23,000,000 units sold in the IPO may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “PAQCU” and the Class A ordinary shares and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “PAQC” and “PAQCW,” respectively.
On March 3, 2022, we announced entry into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Perfect, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2, pursuant to which, among other transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into Provident (the “First Merger”), with Provident surviving the First Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Perfect, and (ii) immediately after the consummation of the First Merger, Provident (as the surviving company of the First Merger) will merge with and into Merger Sub 2 (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, collectively, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub 2 surviving the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Perfect (the “Business Combination”).
Business Combination
Business Combination Agreement
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and subject to the approval of the Provident shareholders, among other things, (i) immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “First Merger Effective Time”), each Provident Class B Ordinary Share, outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time will be automatically converted into a number of Provident 

1




Class A Ordinary Share in accordance with the articles of association of Provident then effective, and, after giving effect to such automatic conversion, at the First Merger Effective Time and as a result of the First Merger, (a) each issued and outstanding Provident Class A Ordinary Share (other than the Provident Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) will be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive one Perfect Class A Ordinary Share after giving effect to the Recapitalization (as defined below), and (b) each issued and outstanding Provident Class A Ordinary Share that is held by any person who has validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or lost their right to dissent from the First Merger in accordance with Section 238 of the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (“Provident Dissenting Share”) will be cancelled and carry no right other than the right to receive the payment of the fair value of such Provident Dissenting Share determined in accordance with Section 238 of the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, and (ii) each issued and outstanding Provident Warrants will be converted into a corresponding Perfect Warrant.
Immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, (i) the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association of Perfect (“Listing A&R AoA”) will be adopted and become effective, and (ii) Perfect will effect a share combination such that each common share of Perfect, par value $0.10 per share, and each preferred share of Perfect, par value $0.10 per share (collectively, the “Pre-Recapitalization Perfect Shares”) (whether issued and outstanding or authorized but unissued) immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, will be consolidated into a number of shares equal to the Combination Factor (as defined below), and upon such share combination, (a) each resulting share held by any person other than DVDonet.com. Inc., Golden Edge Co., Ltd., World Speed Company Limited and Alice H. Chang (collectively, the “Founder Parties”) will be repurchased and cancelled by Perfect in exchange for the issuance of one Perfect Class A Ordinary Share, and (b) each resulting share that is held by the Founder Parties will be repurchased and cancelled by Perfect in exchange for the issuance of one Class B ordinary share of Perfect, par value $0.10 per share (“Perfect Class B Ordinary Share”, and together with Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares, the “Perfect Ordinary Shares”) (items (i) through (ii), the “Recapitalization”). Pursuant to the Listing A&R AoA, each Perfect Class A Ordinary Share will have one vote and each Perfect Class B Ordinary Share will have ten votes.
The “Combination Factor” is a number resulting from dividing the Per Share Perfect Equity Value by $10.00. The “Per Share Perfect Equity Value” is obtained by dividing (i) the equity value of Perfect (being $1,010,000,000) by (ii) the aggregate number of Pre-Recapitalization Perfect Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Recapitalization. Upon the Recapitalization, each Perfect Ordinary Share will have a value of $10.00.
The Business Combination has been approved by the boards of directors of both Provident and Perfect.
Conditions to Closing
The consummation of the Business Combination is conditioned upon, among other things: (i) receipt of the required approval by the Provident shareholders; (ii) receipt of the required approval by the Perfect shareholders; (iii) after giving effect to the exercise of the redemption rights of the Provident shareholders (the “Provident Shareholder Redemption”), Merger Sub 2 (as the surviving company of the Mergers) having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination; (iv) the absence of any law or governmental order enjoining, prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Business Combination; (v) the approval for listing of Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares and Perfect Warrants to be issued in connection with the Business Combination on the Nasdaq immediately following the Closing (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement); (vi) effectiveness of the Registration Statement (as defined below) in accordance with the Securities Act and the absence of any stop order issued by the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement; and (vii) completion of the Recapitalization in accordance with the terms of the Business Combination Agreement.
The obligations of Perfect, Merger Sub 1 and Merger Sub 2 to consummate the Business Combination are also conditioned upon, among other things: (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Provident (subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Business Combination Agreement); (ii) material compliance by Provident with its pre-closing covenants; (iii) the funds contained in Provident’s trust account (after giving effect to the Provident Shareholder Redemption), together with the aggregate amount of proceeds from the PIPE Financing (as defined below) and from the transactions (the “Forward Purchase Financing”) pursuant to the forward purchase agreements that were entered into in connection with Provident’s initial public offering (the “Forward Purchase Agreements”), equaling or exceeding $125,000,000; and (iv) the absence of any event since the date of the Business Combination Agreement that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of Provident to timely consummate the Business Combination.
The obligations of Provident to consummate the Business Combination is also conditioned upon, among other things: (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Perfect (subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Business Combination Agreement); (ii) material compliance by Perfect with its pre-closing covenants; and (iii) the absence of any event since the date of the Business Combination Agreement that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on

Covenants
The Business Combination Agreement includes customary covenants of the parties thereto with respect to operation of their respective businesses prior to consummation of the Business Combination and efforts to satisfy conditions for the consummation of the Business Combination. The Business Combination Agreement also contains additional covenants of the parties, including, among others, (i) a covenant providing for Provident and Perfect to cooperate in the preparation of the Registration Statement on Form F-4 required to be prepared in connection with the Business Combination (the “Registration Statement”), (ii) covenants requiring Provident to call, convene and hold an extraordinary general meeting of the Provident shareholders (the “Provident Extraordinary General Meeting”) to consider and vote upon the Business Combination and to provide the Provident shareholders with the opportunity to effect a Provident Shareholder Redemption in connection therewith as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date that the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act, (iii) covenants requiring Perfect to obtain the approval of the Business Combination by the Perfect shareholders as expeditiously as possible after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and (iv) covenants prohibiting Provident and Perfect from, among other things, soliciting or negotiating with third parties regarding alternative transactions and agreeing to certain related restrictions.
Representations and Warranties
The Business Combination Agreement contains representations and warranties of Perfect, relating, among other things, to corporate organization; the authorization, performance and enforceability against Perfect of the Business Combination Agreement; required consents and filings; absence of conflicts; Perfect’s subsidiaries; capitalization of Perfect and its subsidiaries; financial statements; absence of undisclosed liabilities; absence of changes; litigation; compliance with laws; material contracts; intellectual property; data privacy and security; employee benefits; labor matters; tax matters; insurance; real property; environmental matters; related party transactions; vendors; customers; anti-corruption; information supplied for inclusion in the Registration Statement; and broker’s fees.

The representations and warranties made in the Business Combination Agreement will not survive the consummation of the Mergers.
Perfect Shareholder Earnout
The Business Combination Agreement provides that, from and after the Closing Date (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) until the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Earnout Period”), promptly (but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) after the occurrence of any Shareholder Earnout Event (as defined below). Perfect will issue up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 Perfect Class A and Perfect Class B Ordinary Shares (the “Shareholder Earnout Shares”) to certain persons who are Perfect’s shareholders immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time (the “Shareholder Earnout Participants”) in accordance with each such Shareholder Earnout Participant’s Pro Rata Portion (as defined below). Subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, 3,000,000, 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 of the Shareholder Earnout Shares are issuable if over any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period during the Earnout Period the daily volume-weighted average price of the Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares is greater than or equal to $11.50, $13.00 and $14.50, respectively (each, a “Shareholder Earnout Event”), provided that such Shareholder Earnout Participant holds more than 1% of Perfect’s fully diluted share capital at the time of the applicable Shareholder Earnout Event. “Pro Rata Portion” means, with respect to each Shareholder Earnout Participant entitled to Shareholder Earnout Shares in connection with a Shareholder Earnout Event, a number of Perfect Ordinary Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the aggregate number of Perfect Ordinary Shares held by such Shareholder Earnout Participant at the time of such Shareholder Earnout Event by (ii) the aggregate number of Perfect Ordinary Shares held by all Shareholder Earnout Participants entitled to Shareholder Earnout Shares in connection with such Shareholder Earnout Event at the time of the occurrence of such Shareholder Earnout Event.

In the event that, during the Earnout Period, there is a Change of Control (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement or a definitive agreement providing for a Change of Control has been entered into prior to the expiration of the Earnout Period and such Change of Control is ultimately consummated) or any liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding of Perfect, then any Shareholder Earnout Shares that have not been previously issued by Perfect (whether or not previously earned) will be deemed earned and will be issued by Perfect to the Shareholder Earnout Participants upon the occurrence of such event, unless, in the case of a Change of Control, the value of the consideration to be received by the holders of Perfect Ordinary Shares in such transaction is less than the share price threshold applicable to the applicable Shareholder Earnout Event.
Equity Incentive Plan
The board of directors of Perfect adopted the Perfect Corp. 2021 Stock Compensation Plan (the “Perfect Equity Incentive Plan”) on December 13, 2021, which will remain in effect after the consummation of the Business Combination, subject to appropriate adjustment in connection with the Recapitalization. Upon the consummation of the Recapitalization, each option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Recapitalization to purchase Pre-Recapitalization Perfect Shares granted under the Perfect Equity Incentive Plan prior to the First Merger Effective Time (each, a “Perfect Option”), whether or not vested or unvested, will be adjusted into an option to purchase Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares (in the case the holder thereof is not a Founder Party) or Perfect Class B Ordinary Shares (in the case the holder thereof is a Founder Party). Each such adjusted option will be exercisable for that number of Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares or Perfect Class B Ordinary Shares, as applicable, determined by multiplying the number of Pre-Recapitalization Perfect Shares subject to such Perfect Option immediately prior to the Recapitalization by the Combination Factor, which product will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, at a per share exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Perfect Option immediately prior to the Recapitalization by the Combination Factor, which quotient will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Termination
The Business Combination Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to Closing, including: (i) by written consent of all parties to the Business Combination Agreement ; (ii) by either Provident or Perfect if the consummation of the Mergers is permanently enjoined, prohibited, deemed illegal or prevented by a final, non-appealable governmental order; (iii) by either Provident or Perfect if the Closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2022 (the “Termination Date”); (iv) by either Provident or Perfect upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Business Combination Agreement by the other party if such breach gives rise to a failure of certain closing conditions to be satisfied and cannot be or has not been cured within thirty days following the receipt of notice from the non-breaching party (or any shorter period of the time that remains between the delivery of such notice and the Termination Date); or (v) by either Provident or Perfect if the Provident shareholder approval is not obtained at the Provident Extraordinary General Meeting (subject to any permitted adjournment or postponement).
Certain Related Agreements
Sponsor Letter Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Perfect, Provident and Sponsor entered into a letter agreement (the “Sponsor Letter Agreement”), pursuant to which Sponsor agreed to, among other things, (i) attend the Provident Extraordinary General Meeting to establish a quorum for the purpose of approving the Business Combination, and (ii) vote the Provident Class B Ordinary Shares and any other Provident securities acquired by Sponsor in favor of approving the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.
Under the Sponsor Letter Agreement, Sponsor, in its capacity as the holder of at least a majority of the Provident Class B Ordinary Shares in issue, has agreed to waive any anti-dilution adjustment to the conversion ratio between Provident Class B Ordinary Shares and Provident Class A Ordinary Shares set forth in Article 17.3 of Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of Provident, adopted by special resolution dated January 5, 2021 and effective on and from January 7, 2021 (the “Provident Governing Document”) that may result from the issuance of Provident Class A Ordinary Shares in connection with the PIPE Financing. However, such waiver does not cover any adjustment to the conversion ratio that may result from the closing of purchase of Provident Class A Ordinary Shares and Provident Warrants pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreements (the “Forward Purchase Financing”). In addition, to the extent that, after giving effect to the adjustment to the conversion ratio under the Provident Governing Document as described in the foregoing sentences, the adjusted conversion ratio is less than the sum of (i) one plus (ii) the quotient of (a) the aggregate number of Provident Class A Ordinary Shares issued in the Forward Purchase Financing divided by (b) 23,000,000 (such sum, the “Target Conversion Ratio”), Perfect will issue, immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time but 

4




after the Recapitalization, to each holder of Provident Class B Ordinary Shares as of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time such number of Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares that would make the total number of Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares held by such holder immediately after the First Merger Effective Time equal to an amount that such holder would hold if the Provident Class B Ordinary Shares had been converted into Provident Class A Ordinary Shares at the Target Conversion Ratio immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time.
The Sponsor Letter Agreement also provides that 25.90333% of the Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares held by Sponsor as of immediately after the First Merger Effective Time (the “Forfeited Shares”) will be forfeited and cancelled for no consideration immediately after, and contingent upon, the Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions contemplated by the Sponsor Letter Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Sponsor Earnout Event (as defined below) during the Earnout Period, Perfect will issue Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares of up to an aggregate number equal to 68.74994% of the amount of the Forfeited Shares (the “Sponsor Earnout Shares”) to Sponsor, with (i) 50% of the Sponsor Earnout Shares issuable if over any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period during the Earnout Period the daily volume-weighted average price of the Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares is greater than or equal to $11.50, and (ii) 50% of the Sponsor Earnout Shares issuable if over any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period during the Earnout Period the daily volume-weighted average price of the Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares is greater than or equal to $13.00 (each, an “Sponsor Earnout Event”). In the event that, during the Earnout Period, there is a Change of Control (as defined in the Sponsor Letter Agreement) (or a definitive agreement providing for a Change of Control has been entered into prior to the expiration of the Earnout Period and such Change of Control is ultimately consummated) or any liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding of Perfect, then any Sponsor Earnout Shares that have not been previously issued by Perfect (whether or not previously earned) will be deemed earned and will be issued by Perfect to Sponsor upon such event, unless in the case of a Change of Control, the value of the consideration to be received by the holders of Perfect Ordinary Shares in such transaction is less than the share price threshold applicable to the applicable Sponsor Earnout Event.
Pursuant to the Sponsor Letter Agreement, Sponsor also agreed not to transfer, during a period of twelve (12) months from and after the Closing Date, any Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares and Perfect Warrants held by it immediately after the First Merger Effective Time, any Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares acquired by Sponsor upon the exercise of such Perfect Warrants, or any Sponsor Earnout Shares issued pursuant to the Sponsor Letter Agreement subject to customary exceptions. The lock-up requirements will cease to apply after the later of (i) the date on which the daily volume-weighted average price of the Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any twenty (20) trading days within any consecutive thirty (30) trading day period after the Closing Date and (ii) the date that is one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date.
Perfect Shareholder Voting Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Perfect, Provident and certain shareholders of Perfect (the “Perfect Voting Shareholders”) entered into a voting agreement (the “Perfect Shareholder Voting Agreement”), pursuant to which each Perfect Voting Shareholder agreed to, among other things, (i) attend any Perfect shareholder meeting to establish a quorum for the purpose of approving the Business Combination, and (ii) vote the Pre-Recapitalization Perfect Shares and any other Perfect securities acquired by such Perfect Voting Shareholder in favor of approving the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.
Perfect Shareholder Lock-Up Agreement
At the Closing, Perfect, Provident and certain Perfect shareholders (the “Perfect Lock-Up Shareholders”) will enter into a Lock-Up Agreement (the “Perfect Shareholder Lock-Up Agreement”), pursuant to which each Perfect Lock-Up Shareholder will agree not to transfer (i) any Perfect Ordinary Shares held by such Perfect Lock-Up Shareholder immediately after the effective time of the Second Merger (the “Second Merger Effective Time”), (ii) any Perfect Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase Perfect Ordinary Shares held by such Perfect Lock-Up Shareholder immediately after the Second Merger Effective Time (along with such options or warrants themselves), (iii) any Perfect Ordinary Shares acquirable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Perfect Ordinary Shares held by such Perfect Lock-Up Shareholder immediately after the Second Merger Effective Time (along with such securities themselves) and (iv) any Shareholder Earnout Shares to the extent issued pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement ((i) through (iv) collectively, the “Perfect Shareholder Locked-Up Shares”) during the applicable lock-up period, subject to customary exceptions. For each Perfect Lock-Up Shareholder who is not CyberLink International Technology Corp., DVDonet.com. Inc., Golden Edge Co., Ltd., World Speed Company Limited, Alice H. Chang, Louis Chen or Johnny Tseng, the applicable lock-up period will be six (6) months from and after the Closing Date. For each of CyberLink International Technology Corp., Alice H. Chang, Louis Chen and Johnny Tseng, the applicable lock-up period will be twelve (12) months from and after the Closing Date.

5




Registration Rights Agreement
At the Closing, Perfect, Sponsor and certain shareholders of Perfect will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) containing customary registration rights for Sponsor and the shareholders of Perfect who are parties thereto.
PIPE Subscription Agreement 
Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”) entered into certain share subscription agreements (each, a “PIPE Subscription Agreement”) pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have committed to subscribe for and purchase Provident Class A Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000,000 (the “PIPE Financing”). Under the PIPE Subscription Agreements, the obligations of the parties to consummate the PIPE Financing are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, among others, (i) the absence of a legal prohibition on consummating the PIPE Financing, (ii) all conditions precedent under the Business Combination Agreement having been satisfied or waived, (iii) the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects and (iv) material compliance with covenants.
At the First Merger Effective Time, each Provident Class A Ordinary Share issued in the PIPE Financing will be treated the same as the other issued and outstanding Provident Class A Ordinary Shares and be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive one Perfect Class A Ordinary Share. Perfect has agreed to register the resale of such Perfect Class A Ordinary Shares pursuant to a registration statement that must be filed on or prior to the Closing Date (but not prior to the date when the Registration Statement is declared effective).
Initial Business Combination
The rules of Nasdaq and our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it likely that our board of directors will be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity securities of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.

Other Acquisition Considerations
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, or our Board of Directors cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or from an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying for a target is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our Board of Directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.
Members of our management team and our independent directors own or will own, directly or indirectly, founders shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering which securities will be worthless if we fail to complete a business combination and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Each of our directors and officers presently has, and in the future may further have, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
There is no restriction in the geographic location of targets we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize Asia as the geographical focus. We will seek to identify targets that are likely to provide attractive financial returns through business combinations. However, we have yet to determine a time frame, an investment amount or any other criteria, which would trigger our search for business opportunities outside of Asia. We believe that we will add value to these businesses primarily by providing them with access to the U.S. capital markets.
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.

As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equalled or exceeded $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equalled or exceeded $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants and the sale of the forward purchase securities, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry, we intend to focus our search on companies in the technology sector. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, 

8




we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the trust account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public shareholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following consummation of our initial public offering. Other than the forward purchase agreements, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our sponsors, officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Annual Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Any such payments prior to our initial business combination will be made from funds held outside the trust account. Other than the foregoing, there will be no finder’s fees, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion and they may not be able to rely upon such opinion.

Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
In evaluating the potential business combination with Perfect, we conducted an extensive due diligence review which encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, as well as review of financial, legal and other information which was made available to us. This due diligence review was conducted by our management.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.
Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest earned on the trust account (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of our initial public offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) without a shareholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer(which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and 

11




articles of association would require shareholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules.
The requirement that we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above will be contained in provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of two thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, so long as we offer redemption in connection with such amendment.
If we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a shareholder meeting, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. A quorum for such meeting will be present if the holders of a majority of issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting are represented in person or by proxy. Our sponsor, officers and directors will count toward this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 8,625,001, or 37.5%, of the 23,000,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreement of our sponsor, officers and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a public shareholder on the record date for the general meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.
If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.

12




We intend to require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their share certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, we intend to require a public shareholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the scheduled vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public shareholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public shareholders who elected to redeem their shares.
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. We may, however, raise funds through the issuance of equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop arrangements we may enter into following consummation of our initial public offering, in order to, among other reasons, satisfy such net tangible assets or minimum cash requirements.
Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), is restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Delivering Share Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights
As described above, we intend to require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their share certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, we intend to require a public shareholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the scheduled vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer 

13




documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period.
Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our sponsor or management team acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period.
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust 

14




account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $1,000,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay income taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and the forward purchase securities, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our initial public offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that

our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $1,000,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.
If we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess similar or greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our issued and outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Facilities
We currently utilize office space at Unit 11C/D, Kimley Commercial Building, 142 — 146 Queen’s Road Central, Hong Kong from our sponsor and the members of our management team as our executive offices. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We may plan to have full time employees other than the executive officers prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.
Legal Proceedings
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
