 Overview 
 Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) is a publicly traded Delaware corporation formed in October 2005. Targa is a leading provider of midstream services and is one of the largest independent midstream infrastructure companies in North America. We own, operate, acquire, and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary domestic midstream infrastructure assets. 
 The following should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. We have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements under GAAP and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our accounting records are maintained in U.S. dollars and all references to dollars in this report are to U.S. dollars, except where stated otherwise. Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation. The address of our principal executive offices is 811 Louisiana Street, Suite 2100, Houston, Texas 77002, and our telephone number at this address is (713) 584-1000.
 Our Operations
 We are engaged primarily in the business of:
  
• | gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting and purchasing and selling natural gas;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transporting, storing, fractionating, treating and purchasing and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | gathering, storing, terminaling and purchasing and selling crude oil.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 To provide these services, we operate in two primary segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, and (ii) Logistics and Transportation (also referred to as the Downstream Business).
 Our Gathering and Processing segment includes assets used in the gathering and/or purchase and sale of natural gas produced from oil and gas wells, removing impurities and processing this raw natural gas into merchantable natural gas by extracting NGLs; and assets used for the gathering and terminaling and/or purchase and sale of crude oil. The Gathering and Processing segment's assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota (including the Bakken and Three Forks plays); and the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Our Logistics and Transportation segment includes the activities and assets necessary to convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services such as transporting, storing, fractionating, terminaling, and marketing of NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters and certain natural gas supply and marketing activities in support of our other businesses. The Logistics and Transportation segment also includes the Grand Prix NGL Pipeline (“Grand Prix”), which connects our gathering and processing positions in the Permian Basin, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas with our downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas, as well as our equity interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline LLC (“GCX”), a natural gas pipeline connecting the Waha hub in West Texas and other receipt points, including many of our Midland Basin processing facilities, to Agua Dulce in South Texas and other delivery points. The associated assets, including these pipelines, are generally connected to and supplied in part by our Gathering and Processing segment and, except for the pipelines and smaller terminals, are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
 
Other contains the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses related to derivative contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges.

Recent Developments
 
Response to Current Market Conditions
 
During 2020, global commodity prices declined due to factors that significantly impacted both supply and demand. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread and travel and other restrictions were implemented globally, the demand for commodities declined substantially. Additionally, certain major oil producing nations significantly increased their oil and gas production late in the first quarter which further contributed to the surplus production of commodities. Despite these nations subsequently agreeing to reduce global commodity supplies and global economies beginning to re-open, commodity prices remained weak relative to historical levels and continued to be volatile. Reduced economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with uncertainty around global commodity supply and demand, contributed to lower commodity prices.
 
Furthermore, the decline in commodity prices led many exploration and production companies to reduce planned capital expenditures for drilling and production activities and also led to some companies shutting in wells primarily in the first half of 2020. Such price and activity declines negatively impacted our operations by (i) reducing investments by third parties in the development of new oil and gas reserves, therefore reducing volumes coming onto our systems in the future, (ii) decreasing volumes processed in our facilities and transported on our pipelines and (iii) reducing the prices we receive from the sale of commodities. While commodity prices remain low relative to historical levels and uncertainties associated with the impacts of COVID-19 continue, production from wells that were previously shut-in during the first half of 2020 across our operating areas has largely resumed and energy demand and commodity prices continued to recover compared to the first half of 2020.

There has been, and likely will continue to be, volatility in commodity prices and in the relationships among NGL, crude oil and natural gas prices. We are uncertain of what pricing and market demand, and the associated impact to demand for our services, will be throughout 2021. Across our operations, particularly in our Downstream Business, we benefit from long-term fee-based arrangements for our services. The significant level of margin we derive from fee-based arrangements, combined with our hedging arrangements, helps to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements. For additional information regarding our hedging activities, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Commodity Price Risk.”
 
In the first quarter of 2020, in a response to market conditions, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a reduction in the Company’s quarterly common dividend to $0.10 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 from $0.91 per share in the previous quarter. This reduction provided for approximately $755 million of additional annual direct cash flow, resulting in significant free cash flow available to reduce debt. We continue to work through numerous internal initiatives to respond to current market conditions, including identifying and implementing cost reduction measures such as reducing or deferring non-essential operating and general and administrative expenses.
 
We believe that our long-term strategy, combined with our high-quality asset portfolio, allows us to generate attractive cash flows across commodity price environments. Geographic, business and customer diversity enhances our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our requirements. Our assets are positioned in strategic oil and gas producing areas across multiple basins and provide services under attractive contract terms to a diverse mix of customers across our operational areas. Our contract portfolio has attractive rates and term characteristics, including a significant fee-based component, especially in our Downstream Business. Our Gathering and Processing segment contract mix also has components of fee-based margin, such as fee floors and other fee-based services which mitigate against low commodity prices. 
 
We are currently experiencing no material issues with potential workforce disruptions, and we remain focused on safeguarding employee health and safety and ensuring safe and reliable operations in response to COVID-19. Additionally, we are currently experiencing no material supply chain disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our relationships with our major customers continue to be strong. However, if any of these circumstances change, our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, although significant progress has been made towards the development, distribution and administration of various COVID-19 vaccines, their potential safety and efficacy and timing around when they will become widely available is uncertain at this point. Further, as there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of the disruptions to global energy markets related to the aforementioned current events, we are unable to determine the extent that these events could materially impact our future financial position, operations and/or cash flows.
 
Gathering and Processing Segment Expansions
 
Permian Midland Processing Expansion
 
In November 2020, we announced the transfer of an existing cryogenic natural gas processing plant from our North Texas system (the “Longhorn Plant”), to our Permian Midland system. The plant will be relocated to, and installed in Reagan County, Texas, in 2021 as a new 200 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant (the “Heim Plant”). The Heim Plant will process natural gas production from the Permian Basin and is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
In August 2019, we announced that we began construction of a new 250 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in the Midland Basin (the “Gateway Plant”), which commenced operations in the third quarter of 2020.
 Permian Delaware Processing Expansions
 
In March 2018, we announced that we entered into long-term fee-based agreements with an investment grade energy company for natural gas gathering and processing services in the Delaware Basin and for downstream transportation, fractionation and other related services. The agreements are underpinned by the customer’s dedication of significant acreage within a large, well-defined area in the Delaware Basin. In addition to high-pressure rich gas gathering pipelines and a natural gas processing plant (the “Falcon Plant”), which were placed into service in 2019, we commenced operations of a second 250 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant (the “Peregrine Plant”), in the second quarter of 2020.
 
We provide NGL transportation services on Grand Prix and fractionation services at our Mont Belvieu complex for a majority of the NGLs from the Falcon and Peregrine plants.

Logistics and Transportation Segment Expansion
 
Grand Prix NGL Pipeline Extension

In February 2019, we announced an extension of Grand Prix (the “Central Oklahoma Extension”), extending from Southern Oklahoma to the STACK region of Central Oklahoma where it connects with The Williams Companies, Inc. (“Williams”) Bluestem Pipeline, linking the Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, NGL markets. In connection with this project, Williams has committed significant volumes to us that we will transport on Grand Prix and fractionate at our Mont Belvieu facilities. The Central Oklahoma Extension began operations late in the fourth quarter of 2020. Transportation volumes on the Central Oklahoma Extension accrue solely to Targa’s benefit and are not included in Grand Prix Pipeline LLC (“Grand Prix Joint Venture”), a consolidated subsidiary of which Targa owns a 56% interest.
Fractionation Expansions
 
In November 2018, we announced plans to construct two new 110 MBbl/d fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu, Texas (“Train 7” and “Train 8”). Train 7 commenced operations in the first quarter of 2020 and Train 8 commenced operations in the third quarter of 2020. In January 2019, Williams committed significant volumes which Targa will transport on Grand Prix and fractionate at Targa’s Mont Belvieu facilities (including Train 7). Williams was also granted an option to purchase a 20% equity interest in the fractionation train, which was originally wholly owned by Targa. Williams exercised its initial option and executed a joint venture agreement with us with respect to Train 7 in the second quarter of 2019. Certain fractionation-related infrastructure for Train 7, such as storage caverns and brine handling, was funded and is owned 100% by Targa. Train 8 is owned 100% by Targa.
LPG Export Expansion
 
In February 2019, we announced plans to further expand our LPG export capabilities of propane and butanes at our Galena Park Marine Terminal by increasing refrigeration capacity and associated load rates. The expansion was complete and began operation in the third quarter of 2020. With the additional infrastructure, we increased our effective export capacity up to 15 MMBbl per month in the third quarter of 2020, but given the mix of propane and butane demand, vessel size and availability of supply, and a variety of other factors, our effective working capacity is estimated to be approximately 12.5 MMBbl per month.
Asset Sales
 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we closed on the sale of assets in Channelview, Texas for approximately $58 million.
 
In the first quarter of 2020, we closed on the sale of the Delaware crude system, which was effective December 1, 2019, for approximately $134 million.
 
Financing Activities
 
In February 2021, the Partnership issued $1.0 billion of 4% Senior Notes due 2032, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $992 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer and subsequent redemption payment for the Partnership’s 5⅛% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “5⅛% Notes”), with the remainder used for repayment of borrowings under the Partnership’s senior secured revolving credit facility (the “TRP Revolver”) and our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “TRC Revolver”).
 
Additionally, Targa Pipeline Partners LP (“TPL”) issued notices of redemption for all of the outstanding TPL 4¾% Senior Notes due 2021 and TPL 5⅞% Senior Notes due 2023. These notes will be redeemed on February 22, 2021 with available liquidity under the TRP Revolver.
 
In December 2020, we repurchased 45,800 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share (the “Liquidation Preference”), plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends through the repurchase date. The repurchase was executed at a discount relative to the redemption price of $1,100 per share (the Liquidation Preference multiplied by 110%), which becomes effective March 16, 2021. The difference between the consideration paid (including unpaid dividends of $1.1 million) and the net carrying value of the shares repurchased was $2.7 million, which was recorded as an addition to preferred stock dividends for the year ended December 31, 2020. The partial repurchase is consistent with our ongoing efforts to opportunistically simplify our capital structure and to identify opportunities to generate additional cash flow by enabling us to realize annual cash savings associated with the reduction of preferred stock dividends.

In December 2020, the Partnership redeemed all of its 5,000,000 issued and outstanding 9.00% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the “Preferred Units”) at a redemption price of $25.00 per unit, plus an amount equal to all unpaid distributions up to the date of redemption. The difference between the consideration paid (including unpaid distributions of $0.5 million) and the net carrying value of the units redeemed was $4.9 million, which was recorded as an increase to Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2020. The redemption of the Preferred Units is consistent with our ongoing efforts to simplify our capital structure and to identify opportunities to generate additional cash flow by enabling us to realize annual cash savings associated with the elimination of Preferred Unit distributions. 
 
In August 2020, the Partnership issued $1.0 billion of 4⅞% Senior Notes due 2031, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $991 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund the concurrent cash tender offer (the “August Tender Offer”) and redemption payments for the Partnership’s 6¾% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “6¾% Notes”), with the remainder used for repayment of borrowings under the TRP Revolver.
 
We accepted for purchase all the 6¾% Notes that were validly tendered as of the early tender date, which totaled $262.1 million and redeemed the remaining aggregate principal amount of the 6¾% Notes, which totaled $318.0 million. We recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $13.7 million comprised of $11.1 million premiums paid and a write-off of $2.6 million of debt issuance costs. In November 2020, the Partnership redeemed the $559.6 million remaining balance of its 5¼% Senior Notes due 2023 with available liquidity under the TRP Revolver. We recorded a loss due to debt extinguishment of $1.8 million comprised of a write-off of debt issuance costs.
 
Additionally, during the first half of 2020, the Partnership repurchased a portion of its outstanding senior notes on the open market, paying $239.8 million plus accrued interest to repurchase $303.3 million of the notes. The repurchases resulted in a $61.1 million net gain, which included the write-off of $2.4 million in related debt issuance costs.
 
We or the Partnership may retire or purchase various series of our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.
 
In the second quarter of 2020, we amended the Partnership’s accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Securitization Facility”) to decrease the facility size from $400.0 million to $250.0 million and extended the facility termination date to April 21, 2021. Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we amended the Partnership’s Securitization Facility to increase the facility size to $350 million to more closely align with the borrowing base availability under the Securitization Facility.
 
Share Repurchase Program
 
In October 2020, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”) for the repurchase of up to $500 million of our outstanding common stock. As of February 12, 2021, we have repurchased 5,485,874 shares at a weighted average price of $16.68 for a total net cost of $91.5 million. There is approximately $408.5 million remaining under the Share Repurchase Program. We may discontinue the Share Repurchase Program at any time and are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares.
Corporation Tax Matters
 
On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provides corporate taxpayers an expanded five-year net operating loss carryback period for losses earned in tax years 2018 through 2020. Additionally, the CARES Act allows corporate taxpayers to request an immediate refund of alternative minimum tax credits. We requested a cash refund from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) of approximately $44 million related to the CARES Act provisions and received the refund in the second quarter of 2020.
 
The IRS notified us on April 3, 2019 that it will examine Targa’s federal income tax returns (Form 1120) for 2014, 2015 and 2016. We are cooperating with the IRS in the audit process and do not anticipate material changes in prior year taxable income.

Organization Structure
 The diagram below shows our corporate structure as of February 12, 2021:

 
(1) | Common shares outstanding as of February 12, 2021.
----+---------------------------------------------------

Growth Drivers
 We believe that our near-term growth will be driven by organic projects being placed into service, as well as the level of producer activity in the basins where our gathering and processing infrastructure is located and the level of demand for services provided by our logistics and transportation assets. We believe our assets are not easily replicated, are located in many attractive and active areas of exploration and production activity and are near key markets and logistics centers. Grand Prix connects our gathering and processing positions in the Permian Basin, Southern Oklahoma and North Texas with our downstream facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas and further increases our competitive capabilities to provide reliable, integrated midstream services to customers. Over the longer term, we expect our growth will continue to be driven by our integrated midstream service offering and the strong position of our quality assets which will benefit from production from shale plays and by the deployment of shale exploration and production technologies in both liquids-rich natural gas and crude oil resource plays that will also provide additional opportunities for our Downstream Business. We expect that organic growth and third-party acquisitions will continue to be a part of our long-term growth strategy.
Attractive Asset Positions
 We believe that our position in some of the most attractive basins will allow us to capture increased natural gas supplies for gathering, processing and/or purchase and sale, increased NGLs for transportation and fractionation and increased crude oil supplies for gathering, terminaling and/or purchase and sale. Producers continue to focus drilling activity on their most attractive acreage, especially in the Permian Basin where we have a large and well-positioned interconnected footprint and are benefiting from rig activity in and around our systems.
 The continued development of shale and unconventional resource plays has resulted in increasing NGL supplies that continue to generate demand for our transportation services on Grand Prix, fractionation services at the Mont Belvieu market hub and for LPG export services at our Galena Park Marine Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. In response to increasing demand, we added 320 MBbl/d of additional fractionation capacity with the recent completions of Trains 6, 7 and 8, which began operations in the second quarter of 2019, first quarter of 2020 and third quarter of 2020. We believe that the higher volumes of fractionated NGLs will also result in increased demand for other related fee-based services provided by our logistics and transportation assets. Additionally, we added LPG export infrastructure in the third quarter of 2020, which increased our effective export capacity up to 15 MMBbl per month, but given the mix of propane and butane demand, vessel size and availability of supply, and a variety of other factors, our effective working capacity is estimated to be approximately 12.5 MMBbl per month. Continued demand for fractionation and export capacity is expected to lead to other future growth opportunities.

As domestic producers have focused their drilling in crude oil and liquids-rich areas, new gas processing facilities are being built to accommodate liquids-rich gas, which contributes to the increasing supply of NGLs produced domestically. As drilling in these areas continues, the supply of NGLs requiring transportation and fractionation to market hubs is expected to continue to grow. As the supply of NGLs increases, our integrated Mont Belvieu and Galena Park Marine Terminal assets allow us to provide the raw product, fractionation, storage, interconnected terminaling, refrigeration and ship loading capabilities to support exports by third-party customers. 
 
Drilling and production activity from liquids-rich natural gas shale plays and similar crude oil resource plays
 
We are actively pursuing natural gas gathering and processing and NGL transportation and fractionation opportunities associated with liquids-rich natural gas from shale and other resource plays and are actively pursuing crude gathering and/or purchases and sales, natural gas gathering, processing and/or purchases and sales and NGL transportation and fractionation opportunities from active crude oil resource plays. We believe that our leadership position in the Downstream Business, which includes our transportation, fractionation and export services, provides us with a competitive advantage relative to other midstream companies without these capabilities.
 
Organic growth and third-party acquisitions
 We have a demonstrated track record of completing organic growth and third-party acquisitions and expect to continue to invest capital in our businesses to enhance our competitive advantage as an integrated midstream infrastructure company. We invested approximately $617 million in growth capital expenditures in 2020, or approximately $598 million, net of contributions from noncontrolling interests and including net contributions to investments in unconsolidated affiliates. These expansion investments are distributed across our businesses, with 39% to Gathering and Processing and 61% related to Logistics and Transportation. We currently estimate that we will invest approximately $350 to $450 million in net organic growth capital expenditures in 2021.
 
Competitive Strengths and Strategies
 We believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies due to the following competitive strengths:
 
Strategically located gathering and processing asset base
 
Our gathering and processing businesses are strategically located in attractive oil and gas producing basins and are well positioned within each of those basins. Activity in the shale resource plays underlying our gathering assets is driven by the economics of oil, condensate, gas and NGL production from the particular reservoirs in each play. Activity levels for most of our gathering and processing assets are driven by commodity prices, primarily crude oil prices. Activity levels can impact the volumes of natural gas and crude oil available to us for gathering, processing and/or purchase and sale on our systems. Despite volatile and low commodity prices relative to historical levels, producers continue to focus drilling activity on their most attractive acreage, especially in the Permian Basin, where we have a large and well-positioned integrated footprint and are benefiting from rig activity in and around our systems.
 
Leading fractionation, LPG export and NGL infrastructure position
 
We are one of the largest fractionators of NGLs in the Gulf Coast. Our fractionation assets are primarily located in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and to a lesser extent Lake Charles, Louisiana, which are key market centers for NGLs. Our logistics operations at Mont Belvieu, the major U.S. hub of NGL infrastructure, include connections to a number of mixed NGL (“mixed NGLs” or “Y-grade”) supply pipelines, storage, interconnection and takeaway pipelines and other transportation infrastructure. Our logistics assets, including fractionation facilities, storage wells, low ethane propane de-ethanizer, and our Galena Park Marine Terminal and related pipeline systems and interconnects, are also located near and connected to key consumers of NGL products including the petrochemical and industrial markets. Grand Prix is one of the Y-grade supply pipelines that connects the very active Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu. The location and interconnectivity of these assets are not easily replicated, and we have additional capability to expand their capacity. We have extensive experience in operating these assets and developing, permitting and constructing new assets.
 
10



Comprehensive package of midstream services
 
We provide a comprehensive package of services to natural gas and crude oil producers. These services are essential to gather, process, treat, purchase and sell and transport wellhead gas to meet pipeline standards; extract, transport and fractionate NGLs for sale into petrochemical, industrial, commercial and export markets; and gather and/or purchase and sell crude oil. We believe that our ability to offer these integrated services provides us with an advantage in competing for new supplies because we can provide substantially all of the services that producers, marketers and others require for moving natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from wellhead to market on a cost-effective basis. Both Grand Prix and GCX further enhance our position to offer an integrated midstream service across the NGL and natural gas value chain by linking supply to key markets. Additionally, we believe that the significant investment we have made to construct and acquire assets in key strategic positions and the expertise we have in operating such assets make us well-positioned to remain a leading provider of comprehensive services in the midstream sector.
 
High quality and efficient assets
 
Our gathering and processing systems and logistics and transportation assets consist of high-quality, well-maintained facilities, resulting in low-cost, efficient operations. Advanced technologies have been implemented for processing plants (primarily cryogenic units utilizing centralized control systems), measurement systems (essentially all electronic and electronically linked to a central data-base) and operations and maintenance management systems to manage work orders and implement preventative maintenance schedules (computerized maintenance management systems). These applications have allowed proactive management of our operations resulting in lower costs and minimal downtime. We have established a reputation in the midstream industry as a reliable and cost-effective supplier of services to our customers and have a track record of safe, efficient and reliable operation of our facilities. We will continue to pursue new contracts, cost efficiencies and operating improvements of our assets. Such improvements in the past have included new production and acreage commitments, reducing fuel gas and flare volumes and improving facility capacity and NGL recoveries. We will also continue to optimize existing plant assets to improve and maximize capacity and throughput. 
 
In addition to routine annual maintenance expenses, our maintenance capital expenditures have averaged approximately $129 million per year over the last three years. We believe that our assets are well-maintained, and we are focused on continuing to operate both our existing and new assets in a prudent, safe and cost-effective manner.
 
Large, diverse business mix with favorable contracts and increasing fee-based business
 
We maintain gas gathering and processing positions in strategic oil and gas producing areas across multiple basins and provide these and other services under attractive contract terms, predominantly fee-based, to a diverse mix of producers across our areas of operation. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one oil and gas basin or counterparty. Our Logistics and Transportation assets are typically located near key market hubs and near most of our NGL customers. They also serve must-run portions of the natural gas and natural gas liquids value chain, are predominantly fee-based and have a diverse mix of customers.
 
Our contract portfolio has attractive rate and term characteristics including a significant fee-based component, especially in our Downstream Business. Our expected continued growth of the fee-based Downstream Business may result in increasing fee-based cash flow. Our Gathering and Processing segment contract mix also has significant components of fee-based margin, such as fee floors and other fee-based services which help mitigate against low commodity prices and may increase fee-based cash flow. Additionally, the long-term agreements with the investment grade energy company in the Delaware Basin for natural gas gathering and processing services and logistics and transportation services is fee-based. We continue to advance our initiative to reduce our commodity price exposure across our gathering and processing business by amending contracts or entering into new contracts with predominantly fee-based components and/or protections.
 
Financial flexibility
 
We have historically maintained sufficient liquidity and have funded our growth investments with a mix of equity, debt, asset sales and joint ventures over time in order to manage our leverage ratio. Disciplined management of liquidity, leverage and commodity price volatility allow us to be flexible in our long-term growth strategy, as well as allocating our free cash flow after dividends in a manner that strengthens our credit profile and progresses our long-term goal of achieving investment grade ratings.
 
Experienced and long-term focused management team
 
Our current executive management team possesses breadth and depth of experience working in the midstream energy business. Many members of our executive management team have managed our businesses prior to acquisition by Targa or joined shortly thereafter. Other officers and key employees have significant experience in the industry and with our assets and businesses.
 
11



Attractive cash flow characteristics
 
We believe that our strategy, combined with our high-quality asset portfolio, allows us to generate attractive cash flows. Geographic, business and customer diversity enhances our cash flow profile. Our Gathering and Processing segment contract mix has increasing components of fee-based margin driven by: (i) fees added to percent-of-proceeds contracts for natural gas treating and compression, (ii) new/amended contracts with a combination of percent-of-proceeds and fee-based components, including fee floors, and (iii) fee-based gas gathering and processing and crude oil gathering contracts. Contracts in our Coastal Gathering and Processing segment are primarily hybrid contracts (percent-of-liquids with a fee floor) or percent-of-liquids contracts (whereby we receive an agreed upon percentage of the actual proceeds of the NGLs). Contracts in the Downstream Business are predominantly fee-based (based on volumes and contracted rates), with a large take-or-pay component. Our contract mix, along with our commodity hedging program, serves to mitigate the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow. 
 
We have hedged the commodity price risk associated with a portion of our expected natural gas, NGL and condensate equity volumes, future commodity purchases and sales, and transportation basis risk by entering into financially settled derivative transactions. These transactions include swaps, futures, purchased puts (or floors) and costless collars. The primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to price risk and to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on cash flow. We have intentionally tailored our hedges to approximate specific NGL products and to approximate our actual NGL and residue natural gas delivery points. Although the degree of hedging will vary, we intend to continue to manage some of our exposure to commodity prices by entering into similar hedge transactions. We also monitor and manage our inventory levels with a view to mitigate losses related to downward price exposure.
 
Asset base well-positioned for organic growth
 
We believe that our asset platform and strategic locations allow us to maintain and potentially grow our volumes and related cash flows as our supply areas benefit from continued exploration and development over time. Technology advances have resulted in increased domestic oil and liquids-rich gas drilling and production activity. The location of our assets provides us with access to natural gas and crude oil supplies and proximity to end-user markets and liquid market hubs while positioning us to capitalize on drilling and production activity in those areas. We believe that as global supply and demand for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, and services for each grows over the long term, our infrastructure will increase in value as such infrastructure takes on increasing importance in meeting that growing supply and demand.
 
While we have set forth our strategies and competitive strengths above, our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties which may prevent us from executing our strategies. These risks include the adverse impact of changes in natural gas, NGL and condensate/crude oil prices, the supply of or demand for these commodities, and our inability to access sufficient additional production to replace natural declines in production. For a more complete description of the risks associated with an investment in us, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 
Our Business Operations
 Our operations are reported in two segments: (i) Gathering and Processing, and (ii) Logistics and Transportation (also referred to as the Downstream Business). 
 Gathering and Processing Segment
 Our Gathering and Processing segment consists of gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting and purchasing and selling natural gas and gathering, storing, terminaling and purchasing and selling crude oil. The gathering or purchase of natural gas consists of aggregating natural gas produced from various wells through varying diameter gathering lines to processing plants. Natural gas has a widely varying composition depending on the field, the formation and the reservoir from which it is produced. The processing of natural gas consists of the extraction of imbedded NGLs and the removal of water vapor and other contaminants to form (i) a stream of marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as residue gas, and (ii) a stream of mixed NGLs. Once processed, the residue gas is transported to markets through residue gas pipelines. End-users of residue gas include large commercial and industrial customers, as well as natural gas and electric utilities serving individual consumers. We sell our residue gas either directly to such end-users or to marketers into intrastate or interstate pipelines, which are typically located in close proximity or with ready access to our facilities. The gathering or purchase of crude oil consists of aggregating crude oil production through our pipeline gathering systems, which deliver crude oil to a combination of other pipelines, rail and truck.
 12


We continually seek new supplies of natural gas and crude oil, both to offset the natural decline in production from connected wells and to increase throughput volumes. We obtain additional natural gas and crude oil supply in our operating areas by contracting for production from new wells or by capturing existing production currently gathered by others. Competition for new natural gas and crude oil supplies is based primarily on location of assets, commercial terms including pre-existing contracts, service levels and access to markets. The commercial terms of natural gas gathering and processing arrangements and crude oil gathering are driven, in part, by capital costs, which are impacted by the proximity of systems to the supply source and by operating costs, which are impacted by operational efficiencies, facility design and economies of scale. 
 The Gathering and Processing segment’s assets are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico (including the Midland, Central and Delaware Basins); the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas; the Barnett Shale in North Texas; the Anadarko, Ardmore, and Arkoma Basins in Oklahoma (including the SCOOP and STACK) and South Central Kansas; the Williston Basin in North Dakota (including the Bakken and Three Forks plays) and in the onshore and near offshore regions of the Louisiana Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. 
 The natural gas processed in this segment is supplied through our gathering systems which, in aggregate, consist of approximately 28,700 miles of natural gas pipelines and include 42 owned and operated processing plants. During 2020, we processed an average of 4,398.3 MMcf/d of natural gas and produced an average of 528.9 MBbl/d of NGLs. In addition to our natural gas gathering and processing, the Badlands operations include a crude oil gathering system and four terminals with crude oil operational storage capacity of 205 MBbl, and our Permian operations include a crude oil gathering system and one terminal with crude oil operational storage capacity of 10 MBbl. In January 2020, we closed on the sale of the Delaware crude system, see “—Recent Developments—Asset Sales” above. During 2020, we purchased or gathered an aggregate average of 199.8 MBbl/d of crude oil in the Badlands and Permian.
 The Gathering and Processing segment’s operations consist of (i) Permian Midland and Permian Delaware (also referred to as “Permian”), (ii) SouthTX, North Texas, SouthOK, WestOK (also referred to as “Central”), (iii) Coastal and (iv) Badlands each as described below:
 Permian Midland
 The Permian Midland system consists of approximately 7,000 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and fifteen processing plants with an aggregate nameplate capacity of 2,399 MMcf/d, all located within the Permian Basin in West Texas. Ten of these plants and 4,900 miles of gathering pipelines belong to a joint venture (“WestTX”), in which we have an approximate 72.8% ownership. Pioneer, a major producer in the Permian Basin, owns the remaining interest in the WestTX system. 
 In addition, we are constructing the Heim Plant, a 200 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which was relocated from our North Texas system to our Permian Midland system. The Heim Plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 Permian Delaware
 The Permian Delaware system consists of approximately 6,100 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and eight processing plants with an aggregate capacity of 1,240 MMcf/d, all within the Delaware Basin in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. 
 The Permian Midland and Permian Delaware systems are interconnected and volumes may flow from one system to the other providing increased operational flexibility and redundancy.
 SouthTX
 The South Texas system contains approximately 870 miles of high-pressure and low-pressure gathering and transmission pipelines and three natural gas processing plants in the Eagle Ford Shale. The South Texas system processes natural gas through the Silver Oak I, Silver Oak II and Raptor gas processing plants. The Silver Oak I and II Plants (the “Silver Oak Plants”) are each 200 MMcf/d cryogenic plants. The Raptor Plant is a 260 MMcf/d cryogenic plant. 
 We participate in, and serve as operator for, two joint ventures in South Texas with a subsidiary of Southcross Energy Partners LLC, which consist of our 75% share in T2 LaSalle Gathering Company LLC (“T2 LaSalle”) and our 50% share in T2 Eagle Ford Gathering Company LLC (“T2 Eagle Ford”). T2 LaSalle owns approximately 60 miles of high-pressure gathering pipeline and T2 Eagle Ford owns approximately 120 miles of high-pressure gathering pipelines. Together, these two pipelines gather and transport gas to the Silver Oak Plants. T2 Eagle Ford also owns the residue gas delivery pipelines downstream of the Silver Oak Plants. 
 13


We also participate in a third joint venture in South Texas with Sanchez Midstream Partners LP (“Sanchez Midstream”). We own a 50% interest in the Carnero Joint Venture (“Carnero”) and Sanchez Midstream owns the remaining 50% interest. Carnero owns and Targa operates the Silver Oak II Plant, the Raptor Plant and approximately 45 miles of high-pressure gathering pipeline located in La Salle, Dimmitt and Webb Counties, Texas which connects Mesquite Energy’s Catarina Ranch gathering system and Comanche Ranch acreage to the Raptor Plant. 
 
North Texas
 North Texas includes the Chico gathering system in the Fort Worth Basin, which gathers gas from the Barnett Shale and Marble Falls plays for the Chico plant. The system consists of approximately 4,700 miles of pipelines gathering wellhead natural gas. The Chico plant has an aggregate processing capacity of 265 MMcf/d and an integrated fractionation capacity of 15 MBbl/d. 
 SouthOK
 The SouthOK gathering system is located in the Ardmore and Anadarko Basins and includes the Golden Trend, SCOOP, and Woodford Shale areas of southern Oklahoma. The gathering system has approximately 2,000 miles of pipelines.
 The SouthOK system includes six separate operational processing plants with a total nameplate capacity of 710 MMcf/d, including: the Coalgate, Stonewall, Hickory Hills and Tupelo facilities, which are owned by our Centrahoma Joint Venture, and our wholly-owned Velma and Velma V-60 plants. We have a 60% ownership interest in Centrahoma. The remaining 40% ownership interest in Centrahoma is held by MPLX, LP (“MPLX”).
 WestOK
 The WestOK gathering system is located in north central Oklahoma and southern Kansas’ Anadarko Basin and includes the Woodford shale and the STACK. The gathering system expands into 14 counties with approximately 6,600 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines.
 The WestOK system has a total nameplate capacity of 400 MMcf/d with two separate cryogenic natural gas processing plants known as the Waynoka I and Waynoka II facilities.
 Coastal
 Our Coastal assets, located in and offshore South Louisiana, gather and process natural gas produced from shallow-water central and western Gulf of Mexico natural gas wells and from deep shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico production via connections to third-party pipelines or through pipelines owned by us. Coastal consists of approximately 2,075 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity, 11 MBbl/d of integrated fractionation capacity, 1,000 miles of onshore gathering system pipelines, and 170 miles of offshore gathering system pipelines. The processing plants are comprised of three wholly-owned and operated plants, one partially owned and operated plant, and one partially owned plant which is non-operated. Our Coastal plants have access to markets across the U.S. through the interstate natural gas pipelines to which they are interconnected. The industry continues to rationalize gas processing capacity along the western Louisiana Gulf Coast with most of the producer volumes going to more efficient plants, such as our Lowry and Gillis plants.
Badlands
 The Badlands operations are located in the Bakken and Three Forks Shale plays of the Williston Basin in North Dakota and include approximately 510 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines, 120 MBbl of operational crude oil storage capacity at the Johnsons Corner Terminal, 30 MBbl of operational crude oil storage capacity at the Alexander Terminal, 30 MBbl of operational crude oil storage at New Town and 25 MBbl of operational crude oil storage at Stanley. The Badlands assets also include approximately 280 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and the Little Missouri I-III natural gas processing plants, which have a gross processing capacity of approximately 90 MMcf/d. Additionally, Targa operates the 200 MMcf/d Little Missouri 4 plant (“LM4 Plant”), in which Targa Badlands and Hess Midstream Partners LP each own a 50% interest. Targa owns 55% of Targa Badlands through a joint venture with GSO Capital Partners and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities (collectively, “GSO”). The joint venture is a consolidated subsidiary and its financial results and related statistics are presented on a gross basis. Targa Badlands pays a minimum quarterly distribution (“MQD”) to GSO and Targa, with GSO having a priority right to the MQDs. Additionally, GSO’s capital contributions have a liquidation preference upon a sale of Targa Badlands. Targa Badlands is a discrete entity and the assets and credit of Targa Badlands are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of Targa or its other subsidiaries.

Logistics and Transportation Segment
 
Our Logistics and Transportation segment is also referred to as our Downstream Business. Our Downstream Business includes the activities and assets necessary to transport and convert mixed NGLs into NGL products and also includes other assets and value-added services described below. The Logistics and Transportation segment includes Grand Prix, as well as our equity interest in GCX. The associated assets, including these pipelines, are generally connected to and supplied in part by our Gathering and Processing segment and, except for the pipelines and smaller terminals, are located predominantly in Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas, and in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Our fractionation, pipeline transportation, storage and terminaling businesses include approximately 2,100 miles of company-owned pipelines to transport mixed NGLs and specification products.
 
The Logistics and Transportation segment also transports, distributes, purchases and sells and markets NGLs via terminals and transportation assets across the U.S. We own or market products at terminal facilities in a number of states, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas. The geographic diversity of our assets provides direct access to many NGL customers as well as markets via trucks, barges, ships, rail cars and open-access regulated NGL pipelines owned by third parties. 
 
Additional description of the Logistics and Transportation segment assets and business activities associated with Pipelines, Fractionation, NGL Storage and Terminaling, NGL Distribution and Marketing, Wholesale Domestic Marketing, Refinery Services, Commercial Transportation and Natural Gas Marketing follows below.
 
Pipelines
 
Our primary pipeline assets are Grand Prix and our equity interest in GCX.
 
Grand Prix connects our gathering and processing positions throughout the Permian Basin, North Texas, and Southern Oklahoma (as well as third-party positions) to our fractionation and storage complex in the NGL market hub at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Grand Prix transports NGLs from the Permian Basin on a 24-inch diameter pipeline with a capacity of 410 MMBbl/d, expandable to 550 MMBbl/d, and from North Texas and Southern Oklahoma via pipeline of varying capacity, which both connect to a 30-inch diameter segment into Mont Belvieu. The final segment has a 450 MMBbl/d capacity, which is expandable to 950 MMBbl/d. We own a 56% interest in the Permian and Mont Belvieu segments of Grand Prix through the Grand Prix Joint Venture. Volumes flowing on the pipeline from the Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu accrue to the Grand Prix Joint Venture, while the volumes flowing from North Texas and Oklahoma to Mont Belvieu accrue solely to Targa’s benefit.
 
GCX connects the Waha hub in West Texas and other receipt points, including many of our Midland Basin processing facilities, to Agua Dulce in South Texas and other delivery points, and has a capacity of 2.0 Bcf/d. GCX DevCo JV, of which we own a 20% interest, owns a 25% interest in GCX, which is operated by Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC.
 
Additionally, through our 50% ownership interest in Cayenne Pipeline, LLC, we operate the Cayenne pipeline, which transports mixed NGLs from VESCO in Venice, Louisiana, to an interconnection with a third-party NGL pipeline in Toca, Louisiana.
 16


Fractionation
 
After being extracted in the field, mixed NGLs are typically transported to a centralized facility for fractionation where the mixed NGLs are separated into discrete NGL products: ethane, ethane-propane mix, propane, normal butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline. 
 Contracts for our NGL fractionation services are fee-based arrangements. These fees are subject to adjustment for changes in certain fractionation expenses, including energy costs. The operating results of our NGL fractionation business are dependent upon the volume of mixed NGLs fractionated, the level of fractionation fees charged and product gains/losses from fractionation.
 We believe that sufficient volumes of mixed NGLs will be available for fractionation in commercially viable quantities for the foreseeable future due to historical increases in NGL production from shale plays and other shale-technology-driven resource plays in areas of the U.S. that include Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and the Rockies and certain other basins accessed by pipelines to Mont Belvieu, as well as from conventional production of NGLs in areas such as the Permian Basin, Mid-Continent, East Texas, South Louisiana and shelf and deep-water Gulf of Mexico.
 Although competition for NGL fractionation services is primarily based on the fractionation fee, the ability of an NGL fractionator to obtain mixed NGLs and distribute NGL products is also an important competitive factor. This ability is a function of the existence of storage infrastructure and supply and market connectivity necessary to conduct such operations. We believe that the location, scope and capability of our logistics assets, including our transportation and distribution systems, give us access to both substantial sources of mixed NGLs and a large number of end-use markets.
 
At our Mont Belvieu operated facility, we have eight fractionation trains, representing a gross capacity of 813.0 MBbl/d, including: (1) five fractionation trains with an aggregate capacity of 493.0 MBbl/d that are part of our 88%-owned Cedar Bayou Fractionators, (2) Train 6, a 100 MBbl/d fractionation train (“Train 6”), a joint venture between Targa and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners (“Stonepeak”), in which Targa owns a 20% interest, (3) Train 7, a 110 MBbl/d fractionation train, a joint venture between Targa and Williams which began operations in the first quarter 2020, in which Targa owns an 80% equity interest, and (4) Train 8, a 110 MBbl/d fractionation train, which began operations late in the third quarter 2020 and is wholly-owned by Targa. Certain fractionation-related infrastructure for Train 6 and Train 7, such as storage caverns and brine handling, were funded and are owned 100% by Targa. Our fractionation trains are fully integrated with our existing Gulf Coast NGL storage, terminaling and delivery infrastructure, which includes an extensive network of connections to key petrochemical and industrial customers as well as our LPG export terminal at Galena Park on the Houston Ship Channel. 
 
We additionally have a wholly-owned and operated fractionation facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana, representing a gross capacity of 55.0 MBbl/d.
 
In addition to our operated facilities, we hold an equity investment in, Gulf Coast Fractionators LP (“GCF”), also located at Mont Belvieu. In January 2021, the GCF facility was temporarily idled, but is available for reactivation, subject to prevailing market conditions and agreement with our partners. We will assume operatorship of GCF in the first half of 2021. 
 
We also own fractionation assets at Chico, Monument and Gillis, which are included in our Gathering and Processing segment. In addition, we have a natural gasoline hydrotreater at Mont Belvieu, Texas that removes sulfur from natural gasoline, allowing customers to meet stringent fuel content standards. The facility has a capacity of 35 MBbl/d and is supported by long-term fee-based contracts that have certain guaranteed volume commitments and/or provisions for deficiency payments.

 NGL Storage and Terminaling
 In general, our NGL storage assets provide warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in underground wells, which allows for the injection and withdrawal of such products at various times in order to meet supply and demand cycles. Similarly, our terminaling operations provide the inbound/outbound logistics and warehousing of mixed NGLs, NGL products and petrochemical products in above-ground storage tanks. Our NGL underground storage and terminaling facilities serve single markets, such as propane, as well as multiple products and markets. For example, the Mont Belvieu and Galena Park facilities have extensive pipeline connections for mixed NGL supply and delivery of component NGLs, including Grand Prix. In addition, some of our facilities are connected to marine, rail and truck loading and unloading facilities that provide services and products to our customers. We provide long and short-term storage and terminaling services and throughput capability to third-party customers for a fee.
 Across the Logistics and Transportation segment, we own 34 storage wells at our facilities with a gross NGL storage capacity of approximately 75 MMBbl, and operate 7 non-owned wells, the usage of which may be limited by brine handling capacity, which is utilized to displace NGLs from storage.
 We operate our storage and terminaling facilities to support our key fractionation facilities at Mont Belvieu and Lake Charles for receipt of mixed NGLs and storage of fractionated NGLs to service the petrochemical, refinery, export and heating customers/markets as well as our wholesale domestic terminals that focus on logistics to service the heating market customer base. Our international export assets include our facilities at both Mont Belvieu and the Galena Park Marine Terminal near Houston, Texas, which have the capability to load propane, butanes and international grade low ethane propane. The facilities have an effective export capacity of up to 15 MMBbl per month, but given the mix of propane and butane demand, vessel size and availability of supply, and a variety of other factors, our effective working capacity is estimated to be approximately 12.5 MMBbl per month. We have the capability to load VLGC vessels, alongside small and medium sized export vessels. We continue to experience demand growth for U.S.-based NGLs (both propane and butane) for export into international markets and are in the process of enhancing our loading capabilities.
 
The following table details the Logistics and Transportation segment’s NGL storage and terminaling facilities:

NGL Distribution and Marketing
 We market our own NGL production and also purchase component NGL products from other NGL producers and marketers for resale. Additionally, we also purchase product for resale in our Logistics and Transportation segment, including exports. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our distribution and marketing services business sold an average of 752.5 MBbl/d of NGLs.
 
We generally purchase mixed NGLs at a monthly pricing index less applicable fractionation, transportation and marketing fees and resell these component products to petrochemical manufacturers, refineries and other marketing and retail companies. This is primarily a physical settlement business in which we earn margins from purchasing and selling NGL products from customers under contract. We also earn margins by purchasing and reselling NGL products in the spot and forward physical markets. To effectively serve our distribution and marketing customers, we contract for and use many of the assets included in our Logistics and Transportation segment.
 
Wholesale Domestic Marketing
 
Our wholesale domestic propane marketing operations primarily sell propane and related logistics services to major multi-state retailers, independent retailers and other end-users. Our propane supply primarily originates from both our refinery/gas supply contracts and our other owned or managed Logistics and Transportation assets. We sell propane at a fixed posted price or at a market index basis at the time of delivery and in some circumstances, we earn margin on a netback basis.
 
The wholesale domestic propane marketing business is significantly impacted by seasonal and weather-driven demand, particularly in the winter, which can impact the price and volume of propane sold in the markets we serve.
 
Refinery Services
 
In our refinery services business, we typically provide NGL balancing services through contractual arrangements with refiners to purchase and/or market propane and to supply butanes. We use our commercial transportation assets (discussed below) and contract for and use the storage, transportation and distribution assets included in our Logistics and Transportation segment to assist refinery customers in managing their NGL product demand and production schedules. This includes both feedstocks consumed in refinery processes and the excess NGLs produced by other refining processes. Under typical netback purchase contracts, we generally retain a portion of the resale price of NGL sales or receive a fixed minimum fee per gallon on products sold. Under netback sales contracts, fees are earned for locating and supplying NGL feedstocks to the refineries based on a percentage of the cost to obtain such supply or a minimum fee per gallon.
 Key factors impacting the results of our refinery services business include production volumes, prices of propane and butanes, as well as our ability to perform receipt, delivery and transportation services in order to meet refinery demand.
 Commercial Transportation
 Our NGL transportation and distribution infrastructure includes a wide range of assets supporting both third-party customers and the delivery requirements of our marketing and asset management business. We provide fee-based transportation services to refineries and petrochemical companies throughout the Gulf Coast area. Our assets are also deployed to serve our wholesale domestic distribution terminals, fractionation facilities, underground storage facilities and pipeline injection terminals. These distribution assets provide a variety of ways to transport products to and from our customers.
 Our transportation assets, as of December 31, 2020, include 694 railcars that we lease and manage, 124 leased and managed transport tractors and 2 company-owned pressurized NGL barges.

Natural Gas Marketing
 We also market natural gas available to us from the Gathering and Processing segment, purchase and resell natural gas in selected U.S. markets and manage the scheduling and logistics for these activities.
Seasonality
 
Overall, parts of our business are impacted by seasonality. Our downstream marketing business can be significantly impacted by seasonal and weather-driven demand, which can impact the price and volume of product sold in the markets we serve, as well as the level of inventory we hold in order to meet anticipated demand. See further discussion of the extent to which our business is affected by seasonality in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Operational Risks and Insurance
 We are subject to all risks inherent in the midstream natural gas, NGLs and crude oil businesses. These risks include, but are not limited to, explosions, fires, mechanical failure, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, product spillage, weather, nature and inadequate maintenance of rights of way. These risks could result in damage to or destruction of operating assets and other property, or could result in personal injury, loss of life or environmental pollution, as well as curtailment or suspension of operations at the affected facility. We maintain, on behalf of ourselves and our subsidiaries, including the Partnership, general public liability, property, boiler and machinery and business interruption insurance in amounts that we consider to be appropriate for such risks. Such insurance is subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions that we consider reasonable and not excessive given the current insurance market environment. 
 The occurrence of a significant loss that is not insured, fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations, could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. While we currently maintain levels and types of insurance that we believe to be prudent under current insurance industry market conditions, our inability to secure these levels and types of insurance in the future could negatively impact our business operations and financial stability, particularly if an uninsured loss were to occur. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain these levels of insurance in the future at rates considered commercially reasonable, particularly named windstorm coverage and contingent business interruption coverage for our onshore operations, and potentially excess liability insurance given the current insurance market environment.

Competition
 We face strong competition in acquiring new natural gas or crude oil supplies. Competition for natural gas and crude oil supplies is primarily based on the location of gathering and processing facilities, pricing arrangements, reputation, efficiency, flexibility, treating capabilities (as applicable), reliability and access to end-use markets or liquid marketing hubs. Competitors to our gathering and processing operations include other natural gas gatherers and processors, such as major interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, master limited partnerships and oil and gas producers. Our major competitors for natural gas supplies in our current Permian and Central operating regions include DCP Midstream Partners (“DCP”), Enable Midstream Partners, L.P., Energy Transfer, L.P. (“Energy Transfer”), Enlink Midstream, LLC, Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (“Enterprise”), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (“Kinder Morgan”), MPLX, ONEOK, Inc. (“ONEOK”), WTG Gas Processing, L.P, Western Midstream Partners, L.P., and several other pipeline companies. Our competitors for the gathering and/or purchase and sale of crude oil in North Dakota include Crestwood Equity Partners L.P., Kinder Morgan, MPLX, Hess Midstream, L.P., Summit Midstream Partners, L.P., Paradigm Energy Partners LLC, and Oasis Midstream Partners L.P.  
 We also compete for NGL supplies for Grand Prix. Competition for NGL supplies is primarily based on the proximity of gathering and processing facilities in relation to one or more NGL pipelines, their connectivity to NGL pipeline takeaway options, access to end-use markets or liquid marketing hubs, pricing and contractual arrangements, reputation, efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. Competitors to our NGL pipeline include other midstream providers with NGL transportation capabilities, such as major interstate and intrastate pipeline companies, master limited partnerships and midstream natural gas and NGL companies. Our major competitors for NGL supplies in our current operating regions include DCP, Energy Transfer, Enterprise, ONEOK and EPIC Midstream Holdings, L.P.
 Additionally, we face competition for mixed NGLs supplies at our fractionation facilities. The fractionators in which we own an interest in the Mont Belvieu region compete for volumes of mixed NGLs with other fractionators also located at Mont Belvieu, Texas. Among the primary competitors are Enterprise, Energy Transfer and ONEOK. In addition, certain producers fractionate mixed NGLs for their own account in captive facilities. The Mont Belvieu fractionators also compete on a more limited basis with fractionators in Conway, Kansas and a number of decentralized, smaller fractionation facilities in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Our other fractionation facilities compete for mixed NGLs with the fractionators at Mont Belvieu as well as other fractionation facilities located in Louisiana. Our customers who are significant producers of mixed NGLs and NGL products or consumers of NGL products may develop their own fractionation facilities in lieu of using our services. Our primary competitors in providing export services to our customers are Enterprise, LoneStar and Phillips 66.
 We also compete for NGL products to market through our Logistics and Transportation segment. Our competitors include major oil and gas producers who market NGL products for their own account and for others. Additionally, we compete with several other NGL marketing companies, including BP p.l.c., DCP, Energy Transfer, Enterprise and ONEOK.
 Human Capital 
 
We believe that our employees are the foundation to fostering the safe operation of our assets and delivery of services to our customers. We foster a collaborative, inclusive, and safety-minded work environment, focused on working safely every day. We seek to identify qualified internal and external talent for our organization, enabling us to execute on our strategic objectives.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,372 people that primarily support our operations through a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be good. 
 
Employee Health and Safety
 
Safety is a core value of ours and begins with the protection and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where we operate. We value people above all else and remain committed to making safety and health our top priority. We believe that “Zero is Achievable”, and our goal is to operate and deliver our products without any injuries. We continually seek to maintain and deepen our safety culture by providing a safe working environment that encourages active employee engagement, including implementing safety programs to achieve improvements in our safety culture. 
 
To protect our employees, contractors, and surrounding community from workplace hazards and risks, we implement and maintain an integrated system of policies, practices, and controls, including requirements to complete regular detailed safety and regulatory compliance training for all applicable individuals. 
 
21



In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we moved early and quickly to protect the health and safety of our employees and are continuing to proactively manage our response to an evolving national and global situation. We took several strategic and proactive measures in response to information from the Centers for Disease Control and the local, state and national authorities to try to minimize the risk of business disruption and to protect our ability to deliver reliable services to our customers. Some of these actions include forming a COVID-19 task force of senior management to collaborate, review and execute our business response to the pandemic by instituting various safety protocols including tracking and managing the impact of COVID-19 positive employees and COVID-19 exposed employees, providing and requiring personal protective equipment at all facility locations, social distancing practices, work place build-out modifications, routine cleaning protocols at all facility locations to reduce virus contagion risk, protecting our workforce by providing our non-field employees with technology and equipment to perform their work duties remotely, where applicable, and implementing plans for safely returning to our offices over time.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We are committed to fostering a work environment in which all employees treat each other with dignity and respect. This commitment extends to providing equal employment and advancement opportunities based on merit and experience. We believe this to be a fundamental principle and is defined in our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy and our Code of Conduct. We continually strive to attract a diverse workforce by partnering with local organizations to identify potential candidates to advance and strengthen our human capital management program. 
 
Our employee demographic profile allows us to promote inclusion of thought, skill, knowledge, and culture across our operations to attract and maintain a high-quality workforce.
 
Talent Development and Retention
 
As a midstream infrastructure operator, we understand the importance of developing and fostering talent to ensure a skilled and talented diverse workforce both now and in the future. We value and provide opportunities for cross training and increased responsibilities, including leadership learning. These efforts allow us to recruit from within our organization for future vocational and occupational opportunities.
 
Our management promotes formal and informal learning and development throughout the organization. Candid feedback is provided to employees through our annual performance review process as well as informal meetings throughout the year. 
 We offer developmental programs focused on building the skills of our employees and to help advance employee careers, knowledge, and skillsets through training and related programs. 
 To help plan and predict succession needs, we perform annual succession plans, which are discussed and reviewed with management and, for certain levels and positions, with the board of directors. We additionally monitor employee turnover rates and conduct exit interviews with employees who voluntarily leave the company to better understand their reasons for leaving the company. 
 Regulation of Operations
 Regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas, NGL and crude oil sales, and transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services.
Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Regulation
 Our natural gas gathering operations are typically subject to open access ratable take and/or common purchaser statutes (and implementing rules) in the states in which we operate. The common purchaser statutes generally require gathering pipelines to purchase or take without undue discrimination, while open access gathering requirements generally give producers access to gathering services on terms that are not unduly discriminatory. In one instance, the governing law prohibits undue discrimination with respect to purchase or processing of natural gas. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering and processing facilities to decide with whom (and on what terms) we contract to gather or process natural gas with similarly situated customers (subject, in each case, to the limitations and requirements of each jurisdiction). The states in which we operate have adopted complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. 
 22


Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation as a natural gas company by FERC under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline’s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company. However, to the extent our gathering systems buy and sell natural gas, such gatherers, in their capacity as buyers and sellers of natural gas, are now subject to Order No. 704. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.”
 Our natural gas gathering and processing operations are not presently subject to FERC regulation. However, since May 2009, we have been required to report to FERC information regarding natural gas sale and purchase transactions for some of our operations depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.” 
 Sales of Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil
 The price at which we buy and sell natural gas, NGLs and crude oil is currently not subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state rate regulation. However, with regard to our physical purchases and sales of these energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by FERC and/or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). See “—Regulation of Operations—EP Act of 2005.” Since May 2009, we have been required to report to FERC information regarding natural gas sale and purchase transactions for some of our operations depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.” Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, market participants, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Interstate Natural Gas 
 We own (in conjunction with Pioneer) and operate the Driver Residue Pipeline, a gas transmission pipeline extending from our Driver processing plant in West Texas approximately ten miles to points of interconnection with intrastate and interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. We have obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC waiving certain of the Commission’s tariff and rate regulations. If, however, we receive a bona fide request for firm service on the Driver Residue Pipeline from a third party, FERC would reexamine the waivers it has granted us and would require us to file for authorization to offer “open access” transportation under its regulations, which would impose additional costs upon us.
Interstate Liquids 
 Targa NGL Pipeline Company LLC (“Targa NGL”), Targa Gulf Coast NGL Pipeline LLC (“Targa Gulf Coast”), and the Grand Prix Joint Venture have interstate NGL pipelines that are considered common carrier pipelines subject to regulation by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (the “ICA”). Targa Gulf Coast leases from Targa NGL certain pipelines that run between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Galena Park, Texas and between Mont Belvieu, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Each of these pipelines is part of an extensive mixed NGL and purity NGL pipeline receipt and delivery system that provides services to domestic and foreign import and export customers. 
 In 2019, Targa NGL began operating portions of Grand Prix that transports NGLs from Oklahoma to Mont Belvieu, Texas. On July 27, 2018, Targa NGL submitted a petition for declaratory order to FERC on a proposed rate structure and terms of service for such portions of Grand Prix. The Commission granted Targa NGL’s petition for declaratory order subject to certain conditions on March 11, 2019. Targa NGL requested rehearing on April 10, 2019, which is pending at FERC. On August 6, 2020, Targa NGL submitted a petition for declaratory order to FERC on a proposed rate structure and terms of service related to the Central Oklahoma Extension of Grand Prix, and on October 1, 2020, FERC issued an order granting Targa NGL’s petition in full. Additionally, Grand Prix entered full service during the third quarter of 2019, providing transportation for mixed NGLs from the Permian Basin, including points in New Mexico, to Mont Belvieu, Texas. 
 Unless covered by a waiver, as described below, the ICA requires that we maintain tariffs on file with FERC for interstate movements of liquids on our pipelines. Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing these services. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and non-discriminatory. 
 Targa has multiple NGL pipelines that have qualified for a waiver of applicable FERC regulatory requirements under the ICA based on current circumstances. Additionally, the crude oil pipeline system that is part of the Badlands assets also qualifies for such a waiver. 
 23


All such waivers are subject to revocation, however, should a particular pipeline’s circumstances change. FERC could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that some or all of these pipelines no longer qualify for a waiver. In the event that FERC were to determine that one more of these pipelines no longer qualified for waiver, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC for the applicable pipeline(s) and delivery point(s), provide a cost justification for the transportation charge, and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination.
 Tribal Lands
 Our intrastate natural gas pipelines in North Dakota are subject to the various regulations of the State of North Dakota. In addition, various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”), Office of Natural Resources Revenue (formerly the Minerals Management Service) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as the Three Affiliated Tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Please see “Other State and Local Regulation of Operations” below.
Intrastate Natural Gas
 Though our natural gas intrastate pipelines are not subject to regulation by FERC as natural gas companies under the NGA, our intrastate pipelines may be subject to certain FERC-imposed reporting requirements depending on the volume of natural gas purchased or sold in a given year. See “—Regulation of Operations—FERC Market Transparency Rules.”
 Our intrastate pipelines located in Texas are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “RRC”) and are required to have tariffs on file with the RRC.  Some of these Texas intrastate pipelines also transport natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”).  Under Sections 311 and 601 of the NGPA, an intrastate pipeline may transport natural gas in interstate commerce without becoming subject to FERC regulation as a “natural-gas company” under the NGA, but must file the terms and conditions of transportation of natural gas under authority of Section 311 with FERC, and these terms and conditions must be “fair and equitable.” Specifically, TPL SouthTex Transmission Company LP (“TPL SouthTex Transmission”) and Targa Midland Gas Pipeline LLC (“Targa Midland”) provide NGPA Section 311 service. 
 Our Louisiana intrastate pipeline, Targa Louisiana Intrastate LLC, and the rates and terms of service on the pipeline are subject to regulation by the Office of Conservation of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (“DNR”). 
 We also operate natural gas pipelines that extend from the tailgate of our processing plants to interconnections with both intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. We believe these pipelines are exempt from FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act under FERC’s “stub” line exemption. Texas and Louisiana have adopted complaint-based regulation of intrastate natural gas transportation activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to pipeline access and rate discrimination. The rates we charge for intrastate transportation are deemed just and reasonable unless challenged in a complaint. A complaint also can be filed with FERC regarding the rates, terms, and conditions of service on our pipelines providing service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA.  We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state or FERC regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
 Intrastate Liquids
 
Our intrastate NGL pipelines in Texas transport mixed and purity NGL streams between Targa’s Mont Belvieu and Galena Park, Texas facilities. Grand Prix went into service during the third quarter of 2019, and provides transportation of mixed NGLs from the Permian Basin to Mont Belvieu, Texas. Further, we operate crude gathering pipelines in the Permian Basin. With respect to intrastate movements, these pipelines are not subject to FERC regulation, but are subject to rate regulation by the RRC. 
 
Our intrastate NGL pipelines in Louisiana gather mixed NGLs streams that we own from processing plants in Louisiana and deliver such streams to the Gillis and Lake Charles fractionators in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We deliver mixed and purity NGL streams out of our fractionator to and from Targa-owned storage, to other third-party facilities and pipelines in Louisiana. Additionally, through our 50% ownership interest in Cayenne Pipeline, LLC, we operate the Cayenne pipeline, which transports mixed NGLs from the Venice gas plant in Venice, Louisiana, to an interconnection with a third-party NGL pipeline in Toca, Louisiana. These pipelines are not subject to FERC regulation or rate regulation by the DNR. On May 9, 2019, the Louisiana Public Service Commission (“LPSC”) approved applications to register certain pipelines of Cayenne Pipeline, LLC and Targa Downstream LLC in accordance with the LPSC 2015 General Order, Docket No. R-33390.

EP Act of 2005
 The EP Act of 2005 is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives, authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans, and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry. Among other matters, the EP Act of 2005 amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by FERC, and furthermore provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EP Act of 2005 provides FERC with the power to assess civil penalties up to a maximum amount that is adjusted annually for inflation, which for 2021 equals approximately $1.3 million per violation per day for violations of the NGA and approximately $1.3 million per violation per day for violations of the NGPA. The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce as well as entities that are otherwise subject to the NGA or NGPA. In 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the EP Act of 2005. Order No. 670 does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (Order No. 704), and the quarterly reporting requirement under Order No. 735. The anti-market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of FERC’s NGA enforcement authority.
 FERC Market Transparency Rules
 Beginning in 2007, FERC has issued a number of rules intended to provide for greater marketing transparency in the natural gas industry, including Order Nos. 704, 720, and 735. Under Order No. 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 Bcf of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers, are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.
 Under Order No. 720, certain non-interstate pipelines delivering, on an annual basis, more than an average of 50 million MMBtu of gas over the previous three calendar years, are required to post on a daily basis certain information regarding the pipeline’s capacity and scheduled flows for each receipt and delivery point that has a design capacity equal to or greater than 15,000 MMBtu/d and interstate pipelines are required to post information regarding the provision of no-notice service. In October 2011, Order No. 720 as clarified was vacated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. We take the position that, at this time, all of our entities are exempt from Order No. 720 as currently effective.
 Under Order No. 735, intrastate pipelines providing transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA and Hinshaw pipelines operating under Section 1(c) of the NGA are required to report on a quarterly basis more detailed transportation and storage transaction information, including: rates charged by the pipeline under each contract; receipt and delivery points and zones or segments covered by each contract; the quantity of natural gas the shipper is entitled to transport, store, or deliver; the duration of the contract; and whether there is an affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper. Order No. 735 also extends FERC’s periodic review of the rates charged by the subject pipelines from three years to five years. On rehearing, FERC reaffirmed Order No. 735 with some modifications. As currently written, this rule does not apply to our Hinshaw pipelines.
 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such FERC action materially differently than other midstream natural gas companies with whom we compete.
 Other State and Local Regulation of Operations
 Our business activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies pursuant thereto, governing a wide variety of matters, including operations, marketing, production, pricing, community right-to-know, protection of the environment, safety, marine traffic and other matters. In addition, the Three Affiliated Tribes promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to operations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, on which we operate a significant portion of our Badlands gathering and processing assets. The Three Affiliated Tribes is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. For additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal or local regulatory measures on our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters
 Our business operations are subject to numerous environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may be imposed at the federal, regional, state, tribal and local levels. The activities that we conduct in connection with (i) gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting and purchasing and selling natural gas; (ii) storing, fractionating, treating, transporting and selling NGLs and NGL products, including services to LPG exporters; and (iii) gathering, storing, terminaling and purchasing and selling crude oil are subject to or may become subject to stringent environmental regulation. We have implemented programs and policies designed to monitor and pursue operation of our pipelines, plants and other facilities in a manner consistent with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, and have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with these laws and regulations. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results.
 
The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of onshore facilities, pipelines and other facilities, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, that are the site of an oil spill in waters of the United States, to liability for removal costs and damages;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of environmental assessments and more detailed environmental impact statements that may be made available for public review and comment; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures.

These environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations generally restrict the level of substances generated as a result of our operations that may be emitted to ambient air, discharged to surface water, and disposed or released to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Additionally, there exist tribal, state and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Certain environmental laws also provide for citizen suits, which allow individuals or organizations to act in place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as existing standards are subject to change and new standards continue to evolve.
 
We own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for crude oil and natural gas midstream services for many years. Additionally, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. Under environmental laws such as CERCLA and RCRA, we could incur strict joint and several liability due to damages to natural resources as well as for remediating hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes disposed of or released by us or prior owners or operators. We also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal or to which we sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at or from such third-party sites.
 Over time, the trend in environmental and occupational health and safety regulation is to typically place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment or expose workers to injury and thus, any changes in environmental or occupational health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of enforcement policies that may arise in the future and result in more stringent or costly waste management or disposal, pollution control, remediation or occupational health and safety-related requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. We may not have insurance or be fully covered by insurance against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and we may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs arising out of such risks to our customers. We review regulatory and environmental issues as they pertain to us and we consider regulatory and environmental issues as part of our general risk management approach. For more information on environmental and occupational health and safety matters, see the following Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K: “Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and a failure to comply or an accidental release into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities,” “We could incur significant costs in complying with more stringent occupational safety and health requirements,” “Laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could result in restrictions, delays or cancellations in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells by our customers, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the volumes of natural gas, NGLs or crude oil through our facilities and reducing the utilization of our assets,” and “Our and our customers’ operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change (including legislation or regulation to address climate change) that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide.”

Pipeline Safety Matters
 Many of our natural gas, NGL and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation  (“DOT”), under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (“NGPSA”), with respect to natural gas, and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (“HLPSA”), with respect to crude oil, NGLs and condensates. The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate pipeline facilities. Pursuant to these acts, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing, among other things, pipeline design, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, public awareness, operation and maintenance procedures, operator qualification, minimum depth requirements and emergency procedures, as well as other matters intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. Additionally, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain relatively higher risk areas, known as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) and moderate consequence areas (“MCAs”) along pipelines and take additional safety measures to protect people and property in these areas. The HCAs for natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate pipelines impose increasing safety-related requirements as the population density or ecological sensitivity increases. An MCA is defined in relation to natural gas pipelines and is based on high-population areas as well as certain principal, high-capacity roadways, though it does not meet the definition of a natural gas pipeline HCA. Various states have also adopted regulations, similar to existing PHMSA regulations for, and may have established agencies analogous to PHMSA to regulate, intrastate gathering and transmission lines. Historically, our pipeline safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Risk Factors “We may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from performance of pipeline integrity programs and related repairs” and “Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on pipeline safety standards, including integrity management requirements. 
 
Title to Properties and Rights of Way
 Our real property falls into two categories: (1) parcels that we own in fee and (2) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights of way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our plants and other major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which our plant sites and major facilities are located are held by us pursuant to ground leases or easements between us, as lessee or grantee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors or grantors. We and our predecessors have leased or held easements on these lands for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold or easement estates to such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, rights of way, permit, lease or license, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights of way, permits, leases and licenses.
