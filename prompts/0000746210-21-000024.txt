Item 1. Business
Overview
Oblong, Inc. (“Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000 and is a provider of patented multi-stream collaboration technologies and managed services for video collaboration and network applications. Prior to March 6, 2020, Oblong, Inc. was named Glowpoint, Inc. (“Glowpoint”). 
On October 1, 2019, the Company closed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of Oblong Industries, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation founded in 2006 (“Oblong Industries”), pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Oblong Industries became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). See further discussion of the Merger in Note 3 - Oblong Industries Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto. On March 6, 2020, Glowpoint changed its name to Oblong, Inc. In this Report, we use the terms “Oblong” or “we” or “us” or the “Company” to refer to (i) Oblong (formerly Glowpoint), for periods prior to the closing of the Merger, and (ii) the “combined organization” of Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) and Oblong Industries for periods after the closing of the Merger. For purposes of segment reporting, we refer to the Oblong (former Glowpoint) business as “Glowpoint” herein, and to the Oblong Industries business as “Oblong Industries” herein.
We believe there is a substantial market opportunity for Oblong Industries’ product offerings and services. Therefore, we expect to focus our future investments in product development and sales and marketing on our efforts to grow revenue from Oblong Industries’ products and service offerings. Glowpoint’s business has experienced revenue declines in recent years which we expect to continue. We plan to seek opportunities in the future to divest some or all of Glowpoint’s business. 
Recent Developments
On February 1, 2021, we determined to voluntarily withdraw the listing of the Company’s common stock from the NYSE American Stock Exchange (the “NYSE American”) and transfer such listing to The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). The listing and trading of our common stock on the NYSE American ended on February 11, 2021, and began trading on Nasdaq on February 12, 2021.
The terms of the Company’s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (together, the “Series D and E Preferred Stock”), provided that such shares were automatically convertible into a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the accrued value of the preferred shares (initially $28.50), plus any accrued dividends thereon, divided by the conversion price (initially $2.85 per share, subject to specified adjustments) upon the completion of both (i) approval of such conversion by the Company’s stockholders entitled to vote thereon (which occurred on December 19, 2019); and (ii) the receipt of all required authorizations and approval of a new listing application for the combined organization following the Company’s October 2019 acquisition of Oblong Industries from the NYSE American or any such other exchange upon which the Company’s securities are then listed for trading. This conversion condition was completed in its entirety, and the Series D and E Preferred Stock automatically converted to shares of common stock pursuant to their terms, effective upon the commencement of trading of the common stock on Nasdaq in February 2021 as described above.
Following the conversion of the Series D and E Preferred Stock during February 2021, the Company had issued and outstanding no shares of Preferred Stock.

Managed Services for Video Collaboration
Our services are designed to provide a comprehensive suite of automated and concierge applications to simplify the user experience and expedite the adoption of video as the primary means of collaboration. Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises in a variety of industries. We market our services globally through a multi-channel sales approach that includes direct sales and channel partners.
We provide a range of video collaboration services, from automated to orchestrated, to address the spectrum of user experience and business applications, in an effort to drive adoption of video throughout the enterprise. We deliver our services through a hybrid service platform or as a service layer on top of our customers’ video infrastructure. We provide our customers with the following services to meet their videoconferencing needs:
•Managed Videoconferencing is a “high-touch” concierge-based offering where we set up and manage customer videoconferences. Our managed videoconferencing services are offered to our customers on either a usage basis or on a monthly subscription. These services include call scheduling and launching, and videoconference monitoring, support and reporting.
•Remote Service Management provides an overlay to enterprise information technology (“IT”) and channel partner support organizations and provides 24/7 support and management of customer video environments. Our services are designed to align with a globally recognized set of best practices, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (“ITIL”), to standardize processes and communicate through a consistent set of terms with our customers and partners. We leverage an IT service management (“ITSM”) provider, ServiceNow, Inc., to systematically provide Remote Service Management, as well as enable us to integrate with an enterprise’s systems and workflows. We offer, on a monthly subscription basis, three tiers of Remote Service Management options, ranging from remote proactive automated monitoring to end-to-end management to complement the needs of IT support organizations (including 24x7 support desk, incident/problem/change management, site certifications, and service level agreements).
Network Services
Our network services provide our customers around the world with network solutions that ensure reliable, high-quality and secure traffic of video, data and internet. Network services are offered to our customers on a subscription basis. Our network services business carries variable costs associated with the purchasing and reselling of this connectivity. We offer our customers the following networking solutions that can be tailored to each customer’s needs: 
•Cloud Connect: Video™: Allows our customers to outsource the management of their video traffic to us and provides the customer’s office locations with a secure, dedicated video network connection to the Oblong Cloud for video communications. 
•Cloud Connect: Converge™: Provides customized Multiprotocol Label Switching (“MPLS”) solutions for customers who require a converged network. A converged network is an efficient network solution that combines the customer’s voice, video, data, and Internet traffic over one or more common access circuits. We fully manage and prioritize traffic to ensure that video and other business critical applications run smoothly. 
•Cloud Connect: Cross Connect™: Allows the customer to leverage their existing carrier for the extension of a Layer 2 private line to our data center.

Professional and Other Services
Our professional services include onsite support, or dispatch, as well as configuration or customization of equipment or software on behalf of a customer. On a limited basis, we also resell video equipment to our customers. 
Sales and Marketing
Oblong Industries has sold its product offerings through both direct customer sales and channel partners. Oblong Industries had six employees engaged in sales and marketing activities at December 31, 2020. In June 2019, Oblong Industries entered into a sales channel partner agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc. As a result, the family of Mezzanine™ product offerings became available globally on the Cisco Global Price List as a part of the Cisco SolutionsPlus Program. This program allows Cisco’s customers and channel partners to purchase Mezzanine™ through Cisco’s Global Price List to streamline the ordering process. We anticipate our investments in sales and marketing throughout 2021 will primarily focus on further developing our core channel partner relationships.
Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) has sold its services through both direct customer sales and indirect sales channels. Oblong reduced sales and marketing expenses in recent years in order to reduce expenses and improve cash flow from operations. At December 31, 2020, Oblong had one employee engaged in sales and marketing. 
Market Need
Oblong Industries
Today, ideation and content collaboration are gaining growing importance in both physical and virtual meeting environments to support collective brainstorming and expedite decision making. Visualization of ideas can happen more naturally when people expand the collaborative canvas from sharing a single content stream among many participants to empowering an entire team, such as through our Mezzanine™ multistream solutions. While historically focused on in-room collaboration, the need for next-generation virtual collaboration solutions is on the rise, attributed to the confluence of several key trends that influence the way individuals collaborate. Key capabilities and features of our Mezzanine Series include:
•Share Work With Others. Easily present work by plugging in or sharing wirelessly with the Mezzanine app. Share up to 10 connected devices including laptops, in-room PCs, and digital media players. Upload images and slides to present and explore content alongside live video streams. 
•Capture Ideas Instantly. Save snapshots of on-screen content to make sure good ideas don’t get lost. Annotate content in the Mezzanine app and share thoughts with others. Download meeting materials to reference or share after the meeting.
•Visualize Options and Outcomes. Mezzanine content spans multiple displays so the information needed is in sight and on hand. Share more content, see more detail, and improve visual storytelling. Arrange content for side-by-side comparisons and cross-referencing.
•Unite Distributed Teams. Connect teams and get everyone on the same page. Meeting participants share the same visual workspace so they can perform like they are in the same room. Everyone in every location can add content and steer the conversation, increasing opportunity and motivation to participate.
•Connect with Ease. Mezzanine works seamlessly with existing video conferencing and collaboration solutions so teams can join meetings with the tools they use every day. Integration with Cisco and Polycom systems simplify connecting rooms with voice, video, and content.
•Orchestrate Content. Place content anywhere in the room from anywhere in the room with Mezzanine’s award-winning wands. Gestural interaction makes it easy to move and highlight content to focus the attention of the team.
We believe key drivers for demand include:
•rapid growth of cloud-based unified communications (UC) services adoption and continuously increasing collaborative intensity in workplaces;
-4-


•accelerating demand for low-cost video conferencing options such as USB conference room cameras and audio/video soundbars;
•rising appetite among end-user organizations for content sharing as well as content collaboration capabilities including ideation, annotation, illustration, and coediting;
•convergence of audio, video and content collaboration (as opposed to siloed applications and platforms) to improve employee productivity;
•significant growth in the number of huddle rooms and flexible meeting spaces worldwide;
•preference for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) screen share in meeting spaces; and
•growing number of distributed and remote workers.
Today’s knowledge workers are seeking optimal meeting spaces - both in and out of the office - that foster creativity, agility, innovation, and engagement. The trend towards ad-hoc and small group meetings has led to the creation of the huddle room concept, where workers can meet in a disruption-free setting. Globally, there are over 90 million meeting spaces, 33 million of which are huddle spaces. However, it is estimated that fewer than 5 percent of these spaces are truly ‘full spectrum’ collaboration enabled. Further, the penetration of stand-alone content sharing applications is significantly less than video penetration in large and huddle-sized meeting rooms. While pre-pandemic momentum suggested end-users were beginning to embrace simple, easy to install, intuitive, and affordable collaboration solutions that integrate with cloud-based collaboration software services, we believe as businesses begin to reopen there will be significant demand for higher forms of engagement that combines robust video conferencing with enhanced content sharing as users adapt to more flexible workplace alternatives. This combination focuses on allaying customer apprehension with regards to how to cost-effectively pursue an expanded collaboration strategy without replacing their existing investments. 
Transforming our Business Model 
We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. As part of the transformation of our business, we are evolving certain aspects of our model by designing and developing software to include subscription-based offerings. Historically, our technology products and services have been developed and consumed in conventional commercial real estate spaces such as conference rooms. As our core collaboration products evolve, we expect to add more contemporary software features along with expanded accessibility beyond commercial spaces through both hybrid and SaaS offerings. These initiatives will require significant investment in technology development and sales and marketing. For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results may suffer.”
Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)
Revenue attributable to the former Glowpoint services has declined in recent years primarily due to loss of customers to competition. We expect this trend to continue in the future for the Glowpoint business. As a result of a growing market trend around cloud consumption preferences, more customers are exploring cost-effective software-based services for procuring technology. Many enterprises have become dependent on video communications for increased productivity and reduced operating costs, thus making video communications part of their core business practices. With the technology advancements over the past few years, including browser-based and mobile video, the options for video collaboration solutions and services are greater than ever before. 
Competition
Oblong Industries
The market for communication and collaboration technology services is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain features of our current Mezzanine™ series compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products offered by Cisco Webex, Zoom, LogMeIn, GoToMeeting, along with bundled productivity solutions providers who offer limited content sharing capabilities such as Microsoft Teams, and Google G Suite. In the rapidly evolving “Ideation” market, certain elements of our application compete with Microsoft, Google, InFocus, Bluescape, Mersive, Barco, Nureva and Prysm.

Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)
With respect to our video collaboration services, we primarily compete with managed services companies, videoconferencing equipment resellers and telecommunication providers, including BT Conferencing, AT&T, Verizon, LogMeIn, Yorktel, ConvergeOne, Whitlock and AVI-SPL. We also compete with companies that offer hosted videoconference bridging solutions, including Blue Jeans Networks, Vidyo and Zoom. Lastly, the technology and software providers, including Cisco, LifeSize, Microsoft, and Polycom, are delivering competitive cloud-based videoconferencing and calling services. With respect to our network services, we primarily compete with telecommunications carriers, including British Telecom, AT&T, Verizon and Telus. Our competitors offer services similar to ours both on a bundled and un-bundled basis, creating a highly competitive environment with pressure on pricing of such services. Competitor solutions also create opportunities for integration and support services for Oblong. We believe we differentiate ourselves based on our full suite of cloud and managed video collaboration services in combination with the ITSM platform for support automation. We believe our services are unique based on our intellectual property, user interfaces and capabilities that we have built over the years. 
Customers

Customers and Markets 
Many factors influence the collaboration requirements of our customers. These include the size of the organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. Our customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, commercial, and public sector.
Enterprise
Enterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1,000 or more employees. Many enterprise businesses have unique collaboration needs within a multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages and sell these products primarily through a network of third-party application, technology vendors and channel partners.
Commercial
We define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1,000 employees. We sell to the larger, or midmarket, customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. 
Public Sector
Public sector entities include federal governments, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector entities have specialized access requirements for collaboration services within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector entities primarily through a network of third-party application, technology vendors, and channel partners.
Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)
Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises across a wide range of industries including consulting, executive search, broadcast media, legal, finance, insurance and technology. Major customers are defined as direct customers or channel partners that account for more than 10% of the Company’s total consolidated revenue. 
Customer Concentration
For the year ended December 31, 2020, two major customers each accounted for approximately 17%, of the Company’s total consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, two major customers accounted for approximately 20% and 18%, respectively, of the Company’s total consolidated revenue. Any reduction in the use of our services or the business failure

by one of our major customers and/or wholesale channel partners could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Intellectual Property
Oblong Industries
Oblong Industries’ core technology platform is called g-speak. It enables applications to be developed that run across multiple screens and multiple devices. Our customers use the platform to solve big data problems, to collaborate more effectively, and to go from viewing pixels on a single screen to interacting with pixels on every screen. Oblong Industries invested significant resources in developing intellectual property surrounding this technology, resulting in 69 issued patents (56 in the United States and 13 across Europe, China, Japan, Korea and India) and 8 pending patents (including 7 in the United States). These patents are mainly related to spatial computing, distributed applications and 3D input devices. We expect our issued patents to expire between 2027 and 2038.
Oblong (formerly Glowpoint)
We have invested in research and development, engineering and application development in the process of building our managed service and cloud platforms. Some of this development has led to issued patents, as described below, along with ongoing recognition in the industry as having unique tools and applications to enable our video applications.
Oblong Cloud Conferencing 
The Oblong (formerly Glowpoint) Cloud is based on a Service Oriented Architecture framework that enables us to create unique unified communication service offerings. Our cloud-based-video services can be delivered as a software and infrastructure service in a hosted environment or can support a hybrid mix of public and private clouds.
Videoconferencing has traditionally presented challenges for the user by presenting a complex maze of systems and networks that must be navigated and closely managed. Although most of the business-quality video systems today are “standards-based,” there are inherent interoperability problems between different vendors’ video equipment, resulting in communication islands. Our suite of cloud and managed video services can be accessed and utilized by customers regardless of their technology or network. Customers who purchase a Cisco, Polycom, Avaya, or LifeSize (Logitech) system, or use certain other third-party video communications software such as Microsoft, WebEx or WebRTC, may all take advantage of the Oblong Cloud regardless of their choice of network. We have built the Oblong Cloud to support all standard video signaling protocols, including SIP, H.323 and Integrated Services Digital Network (“ISDN”) using infrastructure from a variety of manufacturers.
The Oblong Cloud combines years of best practices, experience and technology development into a video collaboration platform that provides instant connectivity, self-serve and managed help desk resources, and the ease of use that makes video collaboration seamless and effortless. Beyond the technology and applications, the Oblong Cloud is built around security protocols to enable enterprises and organizations of any size to communicate with other desired video users in a secure, high-quality and reliable fashion.
Video Service Platform
Our Video Service Platform provides enterprise customers with a cloud-based system for managing video collaboration.  The Video Service Platform, which leverages technology from an industry leading ITSM provider, ServiceNow, Inc., is available to our channel partners and enterprise customers. The Video Service Platform’s scalability and multi-tenant design allows us and our channel partners to seamlessly activate existing and new enterprise customers. It is completely web-based and accessible from any web-enabled device. The Video Service Platform automates and streamlines critical functions and workflows needed by IT organizations for managing enterprise video collaboration environments, including incident management, change management, and reporting/analytics for continuous improvement. Other benefits provided to enterprise IT organizations include: (i) better transparency into the performance of the enterprise collaboration environment via business intelligence metrics, reporting and management dashboards; (ii) greater scale with self-service support, giving end users an easy interface for submitting/tracking tickets; (iii) deeper expertise for managing video collaboration with access to our Remote Service Management services and knowledge base; (iv) more efficiencies gained by automating manual tasks and workflows including escalations, updates/notifications, and provisioning; and (v) access to ITIL.

Patents 
The development of our “video as a service” applications and network architecture has resulted in a significant amount of proprietary information and technology. We currently hold 6 patents issued in the U.S. related to real-time metering and billing for video calls, intelligent call routing, and a live video operator assistance feature, which we expect to expire between 2024 and 2031. 
Research and Development
The Company incurred research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $3.7 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to the development of features and enhancements to our products and services. The increase was attributable to the inclusion of research and development expenses for the full calendar year during 2020 for Oblong Industries as compared to inclusion of expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019, during calendar year 2019. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 42 full-time employees. Of these employees, 11 are involved in customer support and operations, 12 in engineering and development, 7 in sales and marketing, and 12 in corporate functions. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. Our compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees and executives and is comprised of a mix of competitive base salary, bonus and equity compensation awards, as well as other employee benefits. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We are committed to diversity and inclusion as well as equitable pay within our workforce. In addition, the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities are of primary concern to us. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant steps to protect our workforce, including but not limited to, working remotely, and implementing social distancing protocols consistent with guidelines issued by federal, state, and local law.
