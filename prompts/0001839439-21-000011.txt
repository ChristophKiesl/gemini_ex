People management has evolved significantly over the last 30 years from an administrative, payroll-centric cost center to a highly strategic function focused on talent management and employee engagement. To be competitive in today’s environment, organizations are increasingly reliant on this function as they seek to leverage people analytics to identify trends and track performance across their workforce. However, most existing HCM solutions lack the comprehensive functionality, ease-of-use, and integration capabilities needed to facilitate effective people management. These limitations are particularly problematic for SMBs which often lack the technical, financial, and people resources of larger organizations.
Our unified, cloud-native platform is purpose-built to provide business leaders with the tools they need to optimize all aspects of people management. See “Our Solution and Key Strengths” section below, within Item 1. Business, for key strengths of our platform.
Our easy-to-use platform incorporates intuitive analytics functionality, enabling SMBs to automate and simplify mission-critical people management processes and enhance visibility into their business operations. Our platform is architected for extensibility and features an open API led interoperability engine that allows customers to easily connect their people data with third-party applications to create a seamlessly integrated digital ecosystem. Our products are supported by a differentiated implementation process and vibrant community of users, which together ensure customers can take full advantage of our platform.
We market and sell our solutions through direct sales teams, leveraging our strong demand generation engine and broker partnerships. We primarily target companies with 10 to 1,000 employees, with such segment of the SMB market accounting for 80% of our recurring billing for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. We intend to grow our customer base by accelerating the expansion of our sales coverage and broker networks in both new and existing markets, with a focus on the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States (“Tier 1 markets”), where we see substantial opportunity. We also intend to grow our customer base through our industry focused product and go-to-market strategy. We market our products via a bundled pricing strategy where we charge customers on a per-employee-per-month (“PEPM”) basis and have demonstrated success at driving growth through the expansion of our Core HCM and Payroll product bundle. We intend to continue to expand our product suite and further cross-sell products into our existing customer base.
Industry Background
Human capital management is an evolving necessity for organizations, with several key trends that have shaped today’s environment.
The Evolution of People Management
Over the last 30 years, the demands of business leaders, employees, and people management strategies have significantly evolved in response to shifting demographics, employee expectations, and technological capabilities. As a result, the importance of people management has been elevated from a payroll-centric cost center to a highly strategic function focused on talent management as a critical component of business competitiveness. The novel coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19 pandemic”) has further reinforced this strategic shift. The HR function has been pivotal as companies strive to maintain morale and productivity for remote workforces. Considering these evolving demands, HCM technology has been forced to transform to replace manual processes with strategic platforms that surface business insights, enabling leaders to make data-driven decisions.
In the late 2000s, the emergence of SaaS brought about two key developments: HCM solutions shifting to focus on digitizing old processes and organizations increasingly using point solutions. This led to more system fragmentation, an overcomplicated user experience, and increased total costs. At the same time, the separation between work and life began to blur, driving an increased need for employee engagement tools. A 2018 study conducted by Gallup highlighted this need persists today, noting that 66% of employees in the U.S. were either not engaged or were actively disengaged.
To address this lack of engagement, many HCM solution providers targeted their product development efforts at enhancing the employee experience. Such providers did this by developing employee portals to drive engagement, similar to social media platforms, but found that employees were not seeking this from their employers. Other unsuccessful attempts to drive engagement included adding gamification attributes to influence behavior, such as encouraging employees to complete compliance training. These product features overlooked the importance of business leaders as the primary users of HCM platforms and as the people most influential in achieving positive employee engagement. A Gallup study reported that managers account for at least 70% of the variance in employee engagement scores across business units. In addition, a 2019 Gartner study showed employee engagement to be the need least met by existing HCM solutions. Business leaders need tools to effectively strengthen engagement, manage career development, and enhance the employee experience.
Complex Regulatory Environment
The ever-evolving regulatory landscape continues to place a burden on small businesses. For example, the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) has required small businesses to quickly adapt to complex requirements. In addition, businesses are forced to navigate thousands of state and local tax codes and industry-specific labor laws. As a result, businesses continue to demand HCM platforms that enable them to maintain a robust compliance framework and abstract the complexity of regulatory changes, such as responding to special employee leave provisions.
Growing Importance of People Analytics
In recent years, businesses have begun to appreciate the value they could derive from stronger data analytics capabilities. SMB leaders are increasingly willing to invest in data-driven decision-making tools to improve their business performance. An IDC survey found that analyzing data and employee engagement had the highest level of third-party investment. In addition, a survey by Gartner showed that 64% of participants ranked improvement of reporting quality and people analytics as their main HR objective when evaluating HCM solutions. SMBs have a particular need for all-in-one solutions considering their unique capacity constraints, such as single person HR departments and limited in-house legal and information technology (“IT”) support.
Unique Needs of SMBs
SMBs demand solutions that have the following key characteristics:
•    Ease of Implementation. The ability to get mission critical solutions up and running seamlessly and successfully without overburdening company resources.
•    Ease of Use. Intuitive design and simple workflows for leaders and their teams.
•    Full Suite of Solutions. Fully integrated platform to serve as a single system of record for all HCM functions with built-in critical capabilities such as compliance, mobility, analytics, and security.
•    Highly Scalable Cloud-based Platform. Flexible solutions built to meet the needs of organizations as they grow in size and complexity.
•    Industry-specific Focus. Solutions, integrations, and support tailored to unique industry needs.
Limitations of Existing Solutions
The vast majority of SMBs still rely on legacy solutions to fulfill their HCM technology requirements. These offerings are typically provided by national and regional payroll service bureaus or in-house solutions built on top of generic enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems. In addition to these legacy solutions, advancements in cloud technology have led to the emergence of other competing SaaS-based HCM offerings. Both legacy and other competing SaaS offerings possess significant limitations in addressing the full HCM needs of SMBs. These limitations include:
•    Incomplete HCM Solutions Lacking in Product Breadth and Depth. Many existing HCM platforms offer incomplete product suites that deliver only a portion of the capabilities required by SMBs or offer ‘full suites’ comprised of products with limited functionality, capable of addressing only the most basic use cases. Often these solutions rely on archaic technologies such as batch processing engines and lack robust compliance and security features. Users of these incomplete platforms are often forced to use multiple products from multiple vendors or continue to manage processes manually outside of their HCM solution.
•    Lack a Unified Approach. Many existing HCM ‘suites’ are comprised of a patchwork of stand-alone applications with limited integration. This lack of unification inhibits the real-time synchronization of data across multiple HCM applications and makes it difficult for SMBs to maintain a single, uniform system of record for employee data. As a result, SMBs are forced to rely on manual, redundant, and error-prone processes to manage and track employee data, which can often lead to untimely payroll, poor employee engagement, and significant compliance issues such as incomplete reporting, and inadequate data security.
•    Difficult to Integrate with Third-Party Systems. Most existing HCM solutions are built on inflexible, closed technology architectures, and are not designed to communicate with external applications. These rigid systems make it difficult for SMBs to integrate HCM tools with other key systems of record such as ERP and POS applications and often require significant manual work to extract and port data to execute routine functions. This inhibits organizations’ ability to establish flexible digital ecosystems capable of addressing the evolving needs of a growing business.
•    Lack Robust Analytics Capabilities. Existing SMB solutions lack tools which are both sophisticated and easy-to-use to access, aggregate, analyze, and act on employee data in real-time. As a result, SMBs are unable to efficiently derive actionable workforce insights and make critical, informed decisions to improve the way they hire, manage, and develop people, such as uncovering turnover trends based on demographics, location, and tenure.
•    ‘One Size Fits All’ Approach. Certain industry verticals have unique people management requirements, such as job costing for manufacturing companies and blended overtime calculations for healthcare employees who work shifts at different pay rates. However, most existing HCM solutions provide generic out-of-the-box functionality and limited configurability, with professional service teams that often lack vertical expertise. As a result, SMBs struggle to address evolving industry-specific people management needs and reporting requirements with existing HCM solutions.
•    Difficult to Use. Many existing solutions have arcane, inflexible user interfaces that lack the intuitive, consumer-like feel of modern SaaS applications. These solutions are often difficult for both employees and leaders to use effectively without significant training. Additionally, many existing HCM suites typically lack consistent functionality and user experience across different devices, and typically require multiple logins to traverse between applications. As a result, people leaders are often forced to revert to time-consuming manual processes to execute simple HR tasks and assist with tedious employee troubleshooting.
•    Not Designed for Business Leaders. Many existing HCM solutions were built with engagement functionality specifically designed for employees, not business leaders who have the most influence over employee engagement. These solutions often lack the end-to-end functionality and powerful analytics required by business leaders for effective people management. As a result, business leaders are incapable of fully leveraging their HCM solution to hire and retain the right talent, optimize routine functions, and transform people management into a strategic driver of business performance.

Our Market Opportunity
We estimate our current annual recurring market opportunity is $29 billion in the U.S. and we expect the opportunity to grow as the number of SMBs increase and we continue to expand our product portfolio. To estimate our market opportunity, we identified the number of companies in the U.S. with an employee count between 10 and 1,000. Based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of January 27, 2021, there were over 1.3 million businesses with between 10 to 1,000 employees, totaling 61.2 million employees within our target demographic. We then applied our $39 total list PEPM rate as of June 30, 2021 for our full suite of products including Core HCM and Payroll, Workforce Management, Benefits Administration and Talent Management to derive our current total addressable market opportunity of $29 billion.
Growth Strategy
We intend to capitalize on our market opportunity with the following key growth strategies:
•    Expand Sales Coverage. We believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to broaden our customer base. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 28,000 customers, which represent a small percentage of the U.S. market for HCM and payroll solutions. Our sales coverage in Tier 1 markets, which encompass 33% of the U.S. population, is 20%, compared to 29% and 48% in the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States other than Tier 1 markets (“Tier 2 markets”) and the 20 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States other than Tier 1 markets and Tier 2 markets (“Tier 3 markets”), respectively. There is a substantial opportunity to continue to grow our sales coverage and customer base in Tier 1 markets. As a result of our historical footprint, a significant majority of our revenue is derived from the Great Lakes and Southeast regions of the United States. We intend to drive new customer additions by expanding our sales coverage in the markets where we have a sales presence and into new markets over the next two years. We believe that our go-to-market engine positions us well to scale our business efficiently and effectively into these markets.
•    Accelerate Broker Channel Partnerships. Benefits brokers are trusted advisors to SMBs and are influential in the HCM selection process. We will continue to work with our existing broker partners and intend to expand our broker network through regional and national partnerships to drive customer acquisition.
•    Expand Industry-specific Functionality and Leadership. SMBs in certain industries require unique functionality for their people management needs. We designed our platform to be easily configurable for industry-specific applications in key verticals such as manufacturing, healthcare, and restaurants. We will continue to expand our solutions and expertise in both existing and new key industries.
•    Expand Product Penetration within Existing Customer Base. Our PEPM is increasing as we continue to grow our HCM product bundle. Our customers typically start with our core HR and payroll solution, eventually expanding their usage of our platform over time. We intend to accelerate this trend going forward and have a significant opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base.
•    Continue to Innovate and Add New Solutions. Given our customer centric approach, we collaborate with our customers in expanding our product offerings. We have a robust product roadmap that is specifically focused on enhancing our ability to address the unmet needs of our customers and prospective customers. We intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development, particularly regarding the functionality of our platform, to sustain and advance our product leadership.
•    Pursue Strategic M&A. We have successfully acquired and integrated several businesses that complement and enhance our software and technology capabilities. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions, ensuring we pursue strategies that expand the depth of our product portfolio and drive revenue synergies through cross sale opportunities. Our focused M&A strategy will help us to continue to drive growth and expand our market footprint and product leadership.

Our technology is powered by a hybrid cloud configuration leveraging geographically dispersed co-located data centers hosted through Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Our platform is designed to be flexible, scalable, and highly configurable and is built on a layer of cloud-native micro services, which supports the platform’s ability to easily integrate with other technologies in our customers’ digital ecosystems. In addition, customer data is stored in a modern database layer and accessed through a unified reporting system.
The platform is designed with security as a top consideration and employs a defense-in-depth strategy through administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the protection, confidentiality, and integrity of our customers’ data. Paycor is NACHA certified, a voluntary accreditation program from the National Automated Clearing House Association which governs the nations automated clearing house (“ACH”) network and payment system. We also routinely complete SOC 1 and SOC 2 examinations. Service Organization Controls (“SOC”) are standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for reporting on internal control environments implemented within an organization. We 
continuously monitor our network and endpoint-based security threats along with antivirus software to guard against trojans, worms, viruses, and other malware.
Our Customers
As of June 30, 2021, Paycor serves over 44,000 clients from approximately 28,000 parent customers. Our target customers are companies with 10 to 1,000 employees and we specialize in the key industries of manufacturing, healthcare, and food and beverage. We currently have more than 2.0 million active employees on our platform.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through a direct sales team, comprised of field sales, insides sales and client sales, each organized by customer size, geography, and industry. Our field sales team focuses on generating new sales to prospects with more than 50 employees, while our inside sales team drives new sales to organizations with less than 50 employees. Our client sales team cross-sells additional bundles to existing customers. Our sales professionals are trained to take a consultative approach to uncover the specific challenges and industry-specific nuances faced by customers and ensure the right solutions are provided. Our sales footprint has historically been concentrated in Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets. We believe there is an attractive opportunity to grow our sales teams in Tier 1 markets.
A core component of our sales and marketing strategy is our partnerships with key centers of influence (“COIs”), which include benefits brokers, financial advisors, financial institutions, and HR consultants. These partnerships enhance our sales motion by generating high quality referrals and providing credibility to our offerings.
We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our direct marketing programs and robust network of COIs. We believe that our sales success is attributable to our differentiated unified platform, our ability to generate high customer return on investment, and our reputation for superior customer service.

Additionally, our HR Center of Excellence is an award-winning resource hub that provides existing and prospective customers with white papers, webinars, and industry research to help organizations optimize human capital management.
As of June 30, 2021, our sales and marketing organization included approximately 290 mid-market field sales professionals.
Research and Development
We invest significantly in research and development to continuously introduce new applications, technologies, features, and functionality. We are organized in small product-centric teams that utilize an agile development methodology. We focus our efforts on developing new applications and core technologies as well as further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of existing applications.
We expensed research and development costs through our consolidated statements of operations of $36.0 million and $45.9 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we capitalized research and development costs on our consolidated balance sheets of $21.2 million and $18.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our research and development personnel are principally located in Ohio and Texas, although many of our associates operate virtually. We seek to hire highly experienced personnel wherever they are located.
Our Service Model
GUIDE Implementation Model
•    GUIDE is Paycor’s differentiated implementation methodology, where we work to Gather, Understand, Import, Deliver, and Evaluate (“GUIDE”), ensuring a successful and seamless transition to our products.
•    GUIDE Elite is a service that offers our larger prospective customers and all clients of broker partners a project manager who serves as the single point of contact and go-to implementation expert throughout the process. With GUIDE Elite, customers are offered extended implementation support of between six weeks to six months following product activation with a focus on training, utilization, and adoption to maximize the value of Paycor’s technology and expertise.
Personalized Support Model
•    Paycor’s personalized support model is based on matching customers with the specialist that has the skillset needed to answer their inquiry. Our customer experience team is based in the United States and delivers a responsive, consultative customer service experience. Our larger customers are assigned a dedicated Customer Success Manager who is focused on driving the value of existing solutions, conducting Executive Business Reviews for strategic planning, and serving as a trusted advisor.
Seasonality
Our revenues are seasonal in nature. Recurring revenues include revenues relating to the annual processing of payroll forms, such as Form W-2, Form 1099, and Form 1095 and revenues from processing unscheduled payroll runs (such as bonuses) for our clients. Because payroll forms are typically processed in the third quarter of our fiscal year, third quarter revenue and margins are generally higher than in subsequent quarters. These seasonal fluctuations in revenues can also have an impact on gross profits. Historical results impacted by these seasonal trends should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future results of operations.
Intellectual Property

Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of laws and intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We require our associates and other employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. In addition, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are also essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position in our industry.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate our rights or to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult and costly, and we may not be successful in detecting or preventing unauthorized activities.
We expect that providers of HCM and payroll solutions such as ours may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the market and the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of our competitors or other third parties might make a claim of infringement against us, which would require us to defend ourselves regardless of the merits of such claim, and could divert the attention of management and cause us to incur costs.
Segment Information
We operate in a single operating segment and a single reporting segment. Since we operate as one segment, all required financial information is presented at the consolidated financial statement level.
Competition
The market for HCM and payroll solutions is fragmented, highly competitive, and rapidly changing. Our competitors vary for each of our solutions and include both enterprise and micro-focused software providers, such as legacy payroll service bureaus (ADP, Paychex), cloud HCM software providers (Paycom, Paylocity, Ultimate Software), and other regional service bureaus and ERP software providers that offer limited functionality.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•    Benefits of a cloud-based technology platform.
•    Breadth and depth of product functionality.
•    Configurability and ease of use of our solutions.
•    Modern, intuitive user experience. 
•    Ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly.
•    Domain expertise in HCM and payroll.
•    Ease of implementation.
•    Quality of implementation and customer service.
•    Real-time web-based payroll processing.
•    Integration with a wide variety of third-party applications and systems.
We believe that we compete favorably on these factors within the SMB market. We believe our ability to remain competitive will depend on the success of our continued investment in sales and marketing, research and development, and implementation and customer services.
Regulation
As a provider of payroll and HCM solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. Data privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in other countries. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal and state government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations affecting or regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. These include, for example, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Affordable Care Act, state breach notification laws and state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. Further, because some of our clients have international operations, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other foreign data privacy laws may impact our processing of certain client and employee information.
In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that apply to them. As such, our products and services may become subject to increasing and/or changing regulatory requirements, including changes in tax, benefit and other laws, and as these requirements proliferate, we may be required to change or adapt our products and services to comply. Changing regulatory requirements might reduce or eliminate the need for some of our products and services, block us from developing new products and services or have an adverse effect on the functionality and acceptance of our solution. This might in turn impose additional costs upon us to comply, modify or further develop our products and services. It might also make introduction of new products and services more costly or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate or prevent introduction of such new products and services. For example, the adoption of new money transmitter or money services business statutes in jurisdictions or changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, could subject us to registration or licensing or limit business activities until we are appropriately licensed.
Our ability to comply with and address the continuously evolving requirements and regulations applicable to our business depends on a variety of factors, including the functionality and design of our solutions and the manner in which our clients and their employees utilize them. We have implemented operating policies and procedures to protect the accuracy, privacy and security of our clients’ and their employees’ information and voluntarily undergo certain periodic audits and examinations and maintain certain certifications to demonstrate our commitment to regulatory compliance.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in Item 1.A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
Associates
As of June 30, 2021, we had a total of 2,067 associates, with women representing 49% of our associates and 37% of our leaders (manager and above); Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”) representing 8% of our associates and 4% of our leaders, and Hispanic/Latinx representing 4% of our associates and 4% of leaders. Approximately 5% of our associates self-identify as LGBTQ+.
Our associates are primarily located in the United States, with the majority working virtually. We add temporary workers for business peaks and engage consultants for specialized functions. Our associates are not represented by labor unions, nor have we experienced a work stoppage.
We are a winner of the 2021 Top Workplace USA award by Energage, LLC. We encourage associates to have a strong, active voice in shaping our work environment, and in problem solving for customers. We believe the whole person comes to work, so we strive for an environment of belonging and inclusivity. At our core, we believe when associates know we care, they push for their personal and professional bests and delight our customers.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are actively committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”). We embrace the diverse mosaic of our associates and build high-performing teams dedicated to success and belonging. In fiscal 2021, we hired a leader of DE&I to create and execute a strategic plan for DE&I, and our CEO signed the CEO Action Pledge for Diversity & InclusionTM, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. 
Our DE&I strategy is guided by four pillars: 
1.Strategic Education and Awareness
2.Transparency in our Data
3.Equity of Pay, Hiring and Treatment of Targeted Populations
4.Purpose and Perspective
These pillars outline the foundation of our action steps as they relate to the goals of the entire organization. We established corporate goals to increase the inclusion and belonging of, and the number of associates and leaders from underrepresented groups and will continue to evolve these goals over time to improve representation. In developing these goals, we conducted a needs assessment and concluded that our opportunities are to focus on universal education of associates, customers, clients and partners, being transparent to our stakeholders, and recruiting, retaining and promoting diverse leadership and perspectives across the Company. In partnership with McKinsey, in fiscal 2021, we offered leadership development opportunities through the Black Leadership Academy to 8.7% of our Black/African American population.
We have incorporated our DE&I strategy and learning into associate onboarding and leader trainings as our associates play a key role in embedding a culture of inclusion into their daily work. Additionally, our commitment to DE&I is reflected through our employee resource groups (“ERG”). The Company maintains various ERGs including Colorful Connections, PRISM (Pride, Raising Awareness, Involvement, Support and Mentoring Alliance), VALOR (Veterans & Loved Ones Resource), Women’s Inspiration Network (WIN), Young Professionals, Toastmasters and Mental Health Awareness Project. We believe our ERGs create a community of inclusion and belonging, and create a safe space for learning and dialogue around the celebrations and challenges that diverse communities face. Each ERG has an executive sponsor and is supported by senior leaders across the Company. 
Community Giving
Giving back is in our DNA. We empower our associates to make a difference in a way that we believe is meaningful to them. Our Community Partners program is a grassroots organization funded by associates who choose to give their own time and resources to serve. To date, our associates have raised nearly $2 million for our community with over 1,400 events and over 37,000 associate volunteer opportunities. We dedicate several days each year for Paycor It Forward, where our associates give back to the communities where we live and work. We established the Paycor Community Impact Fund (“PCIF”) in 2019, which provides project grants to local philanthropic organizations. To date, we have granted over $250,000 to over 35 organizations since the inception of PCIF.
Our Guiding Principles
At Paycor, our culture is built on 30 years of valuing the power of relationships. Our culture is driven by performance, service, and growth. We believe in a spirit of service and humanity that includes every community and everyone our business touches. We grow and perform together. We learn about each other and our customers. We innovate together so that we can succeed together.

•    Take Care of Customers First. Our customers are our heroes. When they win, we win.
