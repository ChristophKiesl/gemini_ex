Business Overview
 
Global Seed Corporation was incorporated in the State of Texas on July 13, 2010. On October 30, 2019, we closed certain share exchange agreement dated October 1, 2019 (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) and acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Well Benefit International Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Well Benefit”), in exchange for the issuance to the shareholders of Well Benefit (the “Shareholders”) an aggregate of 252,874,025 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (the transaction, the “Reverse Merger”).
 
Dongguan Zhenghao Industrial Investment Company Limited (“Zhenghao”), a company formed under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Well Benenfit. Zhenghao provides healthy coffee and beverage products to customers in China. As a result of the Reverse Merger, Zhenghao became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and we transitioned our business focus to providing healthy coffee and beverage products to customers in China through Zhenghao under its established brand, “Ka Su Le”. Our business used to comprise of three segments: (i) wholesale business, including wholesaling coffee and healthy drinks capsules, coffee brewing machines and health supplements and skin care products; (ii) retail selling coffee products and (iii) retail selling of coffee brewing machines. Starting from February 1, 2020, in an effort to control our cost and maximize our interest, we have shifted our business focus to the wholesale business only. As a result, we are no longer involved in the retailing business of selling coffee products and coffee brew machines. We have also stopped selling health supplements and skin care products.
 
Corporate History
 
Since the Company was incorporated in 2010, we had been engaged principally in the distribution of a monthly journal prior to our change in control consummated on June 2, 2018.

Corporate Structure
 
The following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:
 

Industry Overview
 
China’s rising urbanization and disposable income have been and are expected to continue to be the main growth engines of its coffee industry, and more and more people in China have begun to consume more coffee in their daily lives. However, compared to the developed countries, including other East Asian countries and regions, China’s coffee market is still highly underdeveloped. The average coffee consumption has been relatively low and mostly dominated by non-freshly brewed coffee. Despite the increased demand from Chinese consumers, inconsistent qualities, high prices and inconvenience are the key pain points that hamper the growth of China’s coffee consumption. With these pain points being gradually addressed, we expect coffee consumption to accelerate in China.

The capsule beverage market in China, including the capsule coffee market, is far from being saturated and offers tremendous business opportunity due in part to the growth potential of coffee machine sales and the evolving tastes of Chinese customers towards more regular and sophisticated coffee consumption. According to the Statista Report, China ranked number ten with 19.8 billion US dollars, where the top three countries, which is the United States, Brazil and Japan, that has 125.1 billion, 84.1 billion and 80.6 billion US dollars. According to the United Nations Population Division, in 2015 China had 14 billion people where the population of the United States is 0.3 billion. We would love to see people enjoying coffee in this tremendous market.
 
Although a giant brand of instant coffee is dominating the market in China, based on the report of the Euromonitor International, Hot Drinks, 2016 Research Edition, the market size of instant coffee in China has shown declination. According to International Coffee Organization (ICO), although the instant coffee market in China is still taking the lead, the rate of coffee bean import to China was constantly rising at an annual rate of 15% from 2004-2014. An article written by Jesse W. Mattingly from University of Kentucky concludes that coffee market in China is new, however Chinese are getting more knowledgeable in coffee. Producers and retailers should focus on quality in order to bring the traditional culture of coffee to a developing market.
 
Our Products and Services
 
We provide a variety of coffee products and healthy beverages. We use capsules to keep the freshness and tastiness and to standardize the quality of our products. Healthiness, convenience, high quality and affordability are the core values of our product. Our goal is to allow our customers to make coffee or other healthy beverages at home through several simple brewing steps. Our business used to comprises of three segments: (i) wholesale business, including wholesaling coffee and healthy drinks capsules, coffee brewing machines and health supplements and skin care products; (ii) retail selling coffee products and (iii) retail selling of coffee brewing machines. Starting from February 1, 2020, in an effort to control our cost and maximize our interest, we have shifted our business focus to the wholesale business only. As a result, we are no longer involved in the retailing business of selling coffee products and coffee brew machines. We have also stopped selling health supplements and skin care products.
a. Wholesale of Coffee and Healthy Drinks Capsules
 
Coffee and healthy drinks capsules are our major products. We offer a wide variety of high-quality coffee and beverage items, mainly capsules of coffee and non-coffee drinks, that have strong demand and can be produced in bulk with standardized process and consistent quality. Although coffee products have a big market in China, China remains predominantly a tea-consuming nation and the coffee market is significantly unsaturated. With a deep understanding of the Chinese drinking culture that has a history of thousands of years, we give particular attention to selecting the premium raw materials to ensure the high quality of our products.
 
From the initial research and development of products, selecting and purchasing raw materials, testing products and delivering the final products to our customers, our management team strictly monitor each of these procedures. For our coffee products, we are in cooperation with KUBE Development Ltd. (KUBE), our sole coffee beans supplier. For our health drink products, we endeavor to procure genuine and healthy raw materials in capsules, such as non-GMO (non-genetically modified organism) soy milk, Italian cocoa, golden flower dark tea, momordica grosvenori and dendrobium among others. All of our suppliers have relevant certificates from the governments, such as business license and food selling permissions, to show their respective manufacturing capability. Afterwards, the materials will be put into a capsule as a final product which will be tested again by Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS), a world’s leading company of inspection, verification, testing and certification to ensure that the quality of the final product meets our standards.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sold our capsules through our brand stores (each a “Brand Store”, collectively the “Brand Stores”). To join us as a Brand Store, we will charge a one-time brand authorization fee. After becoming our Brand Store, we will grant it the rights to use our brand, Ka Su Le, and provided it with all of the materials (including different kinds of capsules) and equipment that are necessary to make our coffee and other healthy beverages (collectively, the “Initiation Package”). In addition, we provide our Brand Stores with staff training and help them with the designing and decoration of their stores, setting up the equipment and other matters such as developing and shipping products. After paying the brand authorization fee, our Brand Stores will receive certain amount of coffee and healthy drinks capsules, included in their Initiation Package, enabling them to start their business. After that, if the Brand Stores need more supplies of capsules, they will need to purchase them from our retail stores or online store. Each of our Brand Stores is independent from us. Other than providing the Initiation Package and supplying our capsule products, we do not share interests with or take responsibility for the loss of our Brand Stores.
 
In addition, in an effort to better promote our products and enhance our brand recognition, we used to work with and place our coffee machines free of charge in our cooperation stores before the pandemic (each a “Cooperation Store”, collectively the “Cooperation Stores”), including grocery stores, bakeries, super markets, shopping malls and other places with significant customer volume and high demand of coffee. The Cooperation Stores can use our coffee machines free of charge with proper care and a commitment of selling a certain amount of brewed coffee and healthy drinks each month. Similar to our Brand Stores, the Cooperation Stores can purchase our capsules products from our retail stores or online store if they need additional supplies.
 
The global pandemic has posted significant challenges to us. Due to the lockdown policy and the economic downturn in China, many smaller businesses have ceased their operations, including those stores that used to work with us. As of the date of this report, all of our Brand Stores and approximately two thirds of our Cooperation Stores are closed. We are now shifting our business focus to wholesale business only and continue to provide our products to our clients that remain in operations. The management will continue to adjust our operating strategies to better fit the current economy situations and we believe our current priority is to seek new development opportunities while maintaining a low cost of operations.
 
Our customers can purchase our capsules products from our online store through WeChat, one of the most popular messaging, social media and mobile payment apps in China. We are currently in the process of designing a Wechat Mini Program and we plan to launch it at the beginning of 2021. This program is designed to function to serve the purpose of E-mall and customer services. We also plan to develop our own app, hoping to provide with our customers with more options and convenience of online shopping. See below “Our Mobile Apps”.
 
b. Wholesale of Coffee Brewing Machines
 
We provide two types of coffee brewing machines with our customers – one for domestic use and the other is for commercial use. We procure our brewing machines directly from Cino Technology (Shenzhen) Ltd. (“Cino”). Furthermore, we have agreed to use Cino’s fully automatic capsule vending machine (under development) to expand our business distributions to areas with high demand for coffee, such as office buildings, commercial areas and school campuses. Cino provides one to two years of warranties of its brewing machines depending on the type of machine. It also provides training of installation and maintenance to our customer service division.
 
The commercial brewing machine can be installed at our Brand Stores, restaurants and offices. This machine is designed to be user-friendly, enabling users to learn how to operate the machine in a few hours, and then make a drink in our standardized recipe.

Our brewing machines are included in the Initiation Package for our Brand Stores and we are also providing them to our Cooperation Stores free of charge.
 
c. Health Supplements and Skin Care Products
 
Prior to the pandemic, we offered several health supplements and skin care products made from Chinese traditional herbs on our online store. We offer our online customers opportunities to join us as a “health product agent” if they purchase an aggregate of RMB358 (approximately $51) worth of health products from our online store. Each of our health product agent will sign an agent agreement with us and then they will receive their own unique ID codes. Our health product agents have special discounts when they purchase our health products. In addition, each time they develop a new health product agent with their ID codes, they will receive awards points from us which can be then used to purchase health products in our online store. As of the date of this report, we no longer sell health supplements and skin care products.
Our Strategies 
 
The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:
 

● | Enhance our ability to attract, incentivize and retain talented professionals. We believe our success greatly depends on our ability to attract, incentivize and retain talented professionals. With a view to maintaining and improving our competitive advantage in the market, we plan to implement a series of initiatives to attract additional and retain mid- to high-level personnel, including formulating a market-oriented employee compensation structure and implementing a standardized multi-level performance review mechanism.

Our Mobile Apps
 
We are currently in the process of designing a Wechat Mini Program and we plan to launch it at the beginning of 2021. This program is designed to function to serve the purpose of E-mall and customer services. In particular, this program will be designed to cover the entire customer purchase process with user-friendly interfaces. Through this program, our customers can easily view various choice of beverage capsules, health product and accessories, place orders, make payment, check the shipping status and receive notifications of our promotions. We plan to create our own mobile apps with English, simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese versions in 2021.

Procurement
 
We source a variety of high-quality raw materials, including coffee beans and coffee condiments, as well as beverage items, from selected suppliers.

Due to our significant scale, we are able to procure high-quality products from our suppliers at favorable prices. We maintain good relationships with our suppliers.

Coffee Beans
 
As discussed above, we source premium coffee beans from renowned plantations in Colombia, Ethiopia and Indonesia through our supplier, KUBE
 
We set detailed specifications for the raw coffee beans procured by our roasted coffee bean supplier, including size, taste and moisture based on their origin and grades. Together with KUBE, we screen for defected beans in each batch of raw coffee beans through sampling to ensure that they meet our specifications before admitting them to roasting.
 
We set the quality control standards for the testing process of roasted coffee beans. We work with KUBE and a third party inspection agency (SGS) in testing the roasted coffee beans. KUBE conducts the first round of physical and chemical properties testing on the roasted coffee beans, and delivers the batches that passed the test to us. Upon receipt, we will conduct another round of similar testing together with a third-party inspection agency, and return any batch with high defect rate.
 
With the support of KUBE, we have developed our own and unique coffee recipe and we believe the taste of our products is favored by most coffee consumers in China.
 
Health Products Ingredients
 
We also procure many health products ingredients, such as, non-GMO soy milk, Italian cocoa, golden flower dark tea, momordica grosvenori and dendrobium, from reputable suppliers throughout China.

Packaging Materials and Other Consumables
 
In addition to coffee and beverage items, we procure a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups, straws and cutlery, from a number of suppliers. We inspect the categories, specifications and qualities of our packaging materials and other consumables supplies against our standards set out in the respective supply agreements and quality guarantee agreement.

Competition 
 
We integrated many components to create our unique business model which enables us to quickly spread out our coffee and healthy drinks to the market. For those that choose to join us as our Brand Stores, we offer them not only the authorization to use our brand, but also support them with all materials, equipment and even staff training and store decoration guidance to start their business.
