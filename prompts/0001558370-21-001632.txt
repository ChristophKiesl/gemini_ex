ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
Our Company
​
Ingredion Incorporated (“Ingredion”) is a leading global ingredients solutions provider. We turn corn, tapioca, potatoes, plant-based stevia, grains, fruits, and vegetables into value-added ingredients and biomaterials for the food, beverage, brewing and other industries. Ingredion’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “INGR.”
​
We are principally engaged in the production and sale of starches and sweeteners for a wide range of industries, and are managed geographically on a regional basis. Our operations are classified into four reportable business segments: North America, South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Our North America segment includes businesses in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Our South America segment includes businesses in Brazil, the Southern Cone of South America (which includes Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Uruguay), Colombia, and Ecuador. Our Asia-Pacific segment includes businesses in South Korea, Thailand, China, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, India, and Vietnam. Our EMEA segment includes businesses in Pakistan, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa.
​
We supply a broad range of customers in many diverse industries around the world, including the food, beverage, brewing and other industries, as well as the global animal feed markets.
​
Our product lines include starches and sweeteners, animal feed products and edible corn oil. Our starch-based products include both food-grade and industrial starches, and biomaterials. Our sweetener products include glucose syrups, high maltose syrups, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, dextrose, polyols, maltodextrins, and glucose and syrup solids. Our products are derived primarily from the processing of corn and other starch-based materials, such as tapioca, potato, and rice. 
​
We continue to expand our product portfolio through capital investments and acquisitions. We are making investments through our plant-based protein product lines, including pulse-based concentrates, flours and isolates. Capital investment commitments for 2021 are anticipated to be between $330 million and $350 million.
​
On July 1, 2020, we completed our acquisition of 75% ownership of PureCircle Limited (“PureCircle”), the remaining 25% of which is owned by former PureCircle shareholders. PureCircle is one of the leading producers and innovators of plant-based stevia sweeteners and flavors for the food and beverage industry. The acquisition brought global innovation and manufacturing expertise, which we are leveraging with our global go-to-market model, formulation capabilities and broad ingredient portfolio. PureCircle is consolidated by Ingredion for financial reporting purposes.
​
On November 3, 2020, we acquired the remaining 80% of the outstanding shares of Verdient Foods, Inc (“Verdient”). We had previously acquired a 20% equity method investment in Verdient in 2018. Verdient is a Canada-based producer of pulse-based protein concentrates and flours from peas, lentils, and fava beans for human food applications. 
​
Our manufacturing process is based on a capital-intensive, two-step process that involves the wet-milling and processing of starch-based materials, primarily corn. During the front-end process, the starch-based materials are steeped in a water-based solution and separated into starch and co-products such as animal feed and corn oil. The starch is then either dried for sale or further processed to make starches, sweeteners and other ingredients that serve the particular needs of various industries.

​
We utilize our global network of manufacturing facilities to support key global product lines.
​
Products
​
Our portfolio of products is generally classified into the following categories: Starch Products, Sweetener Products, and Co-products and others. Within these categories, a portion of our products are considered specialty ingredients. We refer to the remainder as core products. We describe these three general product categories in more detail below, along with a broader discussion of specialty ingredients within the product portfolio. 
​
Starch Products: Our starch products represented approximately 46 percent of our net sales for each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. Starches are an important component in a wide range of processed foods, where they are used for adhesion, clouding, dusting, expansion, fat replacement, freshness, gelling, glazing, mouthfeel, stabilization, and texture. Cornstarch is sold to cornstarch packers for sale to consumers. Starches are also used in paper production to create a smooth surface for printed communications and to improve strength in recycled papers. Specialty starches are used for enhanced drainage, fiber retention, oil and grease resistance, improved printability, and biochemical oxygen demand control. The textile industry uses starches and specialty starches for sizing (abrasion resistance) to provide size and finishes for manufactured products. Industrial starches are used in the production of construction materials, textiles, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, as well as in mining, water filtration, and oil and gas drilling. Specialty starches are used for biomaterial applications including biodegradable plastics, fabric softeners and detergents, hair and skin care applications, dusting powders for surgical gloves, and in the production of glass fiber and insulation.

4



​
Sweetener Products: Our sweetener products represented approximately 35 percent, 36 percent, and 36 percent of our net sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sweeteners include products such as glucose syrups, high maltose syrup, high fructose corn syrup, dextrose, polyols, maltodextrin, glucose syrup solids, and non-GMO (genetically modified organism) syrups. Our sweeteners are used in a wide variety of food and beverage products, such as baked goods, snack foods, canned fruits, condiments, candy and other sweets, dairy products, ice cream, jams and jellies, prepared mixes, table syrups, soft drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, beer, and many others. These sweetener products also offer functionality in addition to sweetness, such as texture, body and viscosity; help control freezing points, crystallization, and browning; add humectancy (ability to add moisture) and flavor; and act as binders. Our high maltose syrups speed the fermentation process, allowing brewers to increase capacity without adding capital. Dextrose has a wide range of applications in the food and confection industries, in solutions for intravenous (“IV”) and other pharmaceutical applications, and numerous industrial applications like wallboard, biodegradable surface agents, and moisture control agents. Our specialty sweeteners provide affordable, natural, reduced calorie and sugar-free solutions for our customers. 
​
Co-products and others: Co-products and others accounted for approximately 19 percent, 18 percent, and 18 percent of our net sales for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Refined corn oil (from germ) is sold to packers of cooking oil and to producers of margarine, salad dressings, shortening, mayonnaise, and other foods. Corn gluten feed is sold as animal feed. Corn gluten meal is sold as high-protein feed for chickens, pet food, and aquaculture. Our other products include fruit and vegetable products, such as concentrates, purees, and essences, as well as pulse proteins and hydrocolloids systems and blends.
​
Specialty Ingredients within the product portfolio: We consider certain of our products to be specialty ingredients. Specialty ingredients accounted for approximately 32 percent of our net sales for 2020, up from 30 percent and 29 percent in 2019 and 2018, respectively. These ingredients deliver more functionality than our other products and add additional customer value. Our specialty ingredients are aligned with growing market and consumer trends such as health and wellness, clean-label, simple ingredients, affordability, indulgence, and sustainability. 
​
We drive growth for our specialty ingredients portfolio by leveraging the following five growth platforms: Starch-based Texturizers, Clean and Simple Ingredients, Sugar Reduction and Specialty Sweeteners, Food Systems, and Plant-based Proteins.
​
Starch-based Texturizers: These ingredients support the structure and texture behind great eating experiences.  Products are made from corn, potato, rice, and tapioca and offer a multitude of textures, functionalities, and stability during processing and shelf life to a broad range of food products. 
​
Clean and Simple Ingredients: These functional ingredients address the clean label trend for finished products made with shorter lists of food ingredients that have achieved broad consumer acceptance. From food and beverages to pet food and personal care, consumers are looking for clean, simple, natural, and authentic products that they can identify and trust.  The broad portfolio of clean label ingredients includes: starches, sweeteners, flours, nutrition ingredients, emulsifiers and fruit and vegetable concentrates. 
​
Sugar Reduction and Specialty Sweeteners: These solutions provide sweetness and functional replacement for sugar in reduced-calorie and sugar-free foods and beverages without sacrificing quality and consistency. These specialty ingredients are made from a variety of GMO and non-GMO raw material bases and include such ingredients as plant-based stevia sweeteners, polyols, dextrose, and allulose, a rare sugar. 
 ​
Food Systems: These systems deliver proven ingredient combinations to accelerate product development that enable customers to get to market faster.  A food system can address an array of functional challenges, including: mouthfeel/texture for dairy and alternative dairy products, thickening of sauces, stabilization in high-protein drinks, gelling for fruit fillings, film formers for candy shells, foaming and frothing, adding soluble fibers and nutritional ingredients, adhering particles to breads, and emulsification of flavors.
​

5



Plant-based Proteins: These specialty pulse-based protein ingredients bring solutions made from lentils, chickpeas, fava beans, and peas.  They add protein, dietary fiber, micronutrients and texture to food and beverages. 
​
​
Competition
​
The starch and sweetener industry is highly competitive. Competition within our markets is largely based on product functionality, price, and quality. Many of our products are viewed as basic ingredients that compete with virtually identical products and derivatives manufactured by other companies in the industry. The U.S. is a highly competitive market with operations by other starch processors, several of which are divisions of larger enterprises. Some of these competitors, unlike us, have vertically integrated their starch processing and other operations. Competitors include ADM’s Starches and Sweeteners business within its Carbohydrates Solutions business segment (“ADM,” a division of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company), Cargill, Inc. (“Cargill”), Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. (“Tate & Lyle”), and several others. Our operations in Mexico and Canada face competition from U.S. imports and local producers including ALMEX, a Mexican joint venture between ADM and Tate & Lyle. In South America, Cargill has starch processing operations in Brazil and Argentina. We also face competition from Roquette Frères S.A. (“Roquette”) primarily in our North America region. Many smaller local corn and tapioca processors also operate in many of our markets.
​
Several of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn. High fructose corn syrup and monohydrate dextrose compete principally with cane and beet sugar products. Co-products such as corn oil and gluten meal compete with products of the corn dry milling industry and with soybean oil, soybean meal, and other products. Fluctuations in prices of these competing products may affect prices of, and profits derived from, our products.
​
Customers
​
We supply a broad range of customers in over 60 industries worldwide. The following table provides the approximate percentage of total net sales by industry for each of our industries served in 2020:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

​
No customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in 2020, 2019, or 2018.
​
Raw Materials
​
Corn (primarily yellow dent) is the primary basic raw material we use to produce starches and sweeteners. The supply of corn in the U.S. has been, and is anticipated to continue to be, adequate for our domestic needs. The price of corn, which is determined by reference to prices on the Chicago Board of Trade, fluctuates as a result of various factors including: farmers’ planting decisions, climate, domestic and foreign government policies (including those related to the production of ethanol), livestock feeding, shortages or surpluses of world grain supplies, and trade agreements. We use starch from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture ingredients derived from potato-based starches. We also use tapioca, gum, rice, plant-based stevia, peas, and sugar as raw materials.
​

6



Corn is also grown in other areas of the world, including China, Brazil, Europe, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Canada and Pakistan. Our subsidiaries outside the U.S. utilize both local supplies of corn and corn imported from other geographic areas, including the U.S. The supply of corn for these subsidiaries is also generally expected to be adequate for our needs. Corn prices for our non-U.S. affiliates generally fluctuate as a result of the same factors that affect U.S. corn prices.
​
We also utilize specialty grains such as waxy and high amylose corn in our operations. In general, the planning cycle for our specialty grain sourcing begins three years in advance of the anticipated delivery of the specialty corn since the necessary seed must be grown in the season prior to grain contracting. In order to secure these specialty grains at the time of our anticipated needs, we contract with certain farmers to grow the specialty corn approximately two years in advance of delivery. These specialty grains have a higher cost due to their more limited supply and require longer planning cycles to mitigate the risk of supply shortages.
​
Due to the competitive nature of our industry and the availability of substitute products not produced from corn, such as sugar from cane or beets, end-product prices may not necessarily fluctuate in a manner that correlates to raw material costs of corn.
​
We follow a policy of hedging our exposure to commodity price fluctuations with commodities futures and options contracts primarily for certain of our North American corn purchases. We use derivative hedging contracts to protect the gross margin of our firm-priced business primarily in North America. Other operations may or may not be hedged at any given time based on management’s judgment as to the need to fix the costs of our raw materials to protect our profitability. Outside of North America, we generally enter into short-term commercial sales contracts and adjust our selling prices based upon the local raw material costs. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in the section entitled “Commodity Costs” for additional information.
​
Other raw materials used in our manufacturing processes include starch from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture ingredients derived from potato-based starches. In addition, we use tapioca, particularly in certain of our production processes in the Asia-Pacific region. While the price of tapioca fluctuates from time-to-time as a result of growing conditions, the supply of tapioca has been, and is anticipated to continue to be, adequate for our production needs in the various markets in which we operate. In addition to corn, potato, and tapioca, we use pulses, gums, rice, plant-based stevia, peas, and sugar as raw materials, among others.
​
Research and Development
​
We have a global network of more than 500 scientists working in 32 Ingredion Idea Labs® innovation centers with headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey. Activities at Bridgewater include plant science and physical, chemical and biochemical modifications to food formulations, food sensory evaluation, and development of non-food applications such as starch-based biopolymers. In addition, we have product application technology centers that direct our product development teams worldwide to create product application solutions to better serve the ingredient needs of our customers. Product development activity is focused on developing product applications for identified customer and market needs. Through this approach, we have developed value-added products for use by customers in various industries. We usually collaborate with customers to develop the desired product application either in the customers’ facilities, our technical service laboratories, or on a contract basis. These efforts are supported by our marketing, product technology, and technology support staff. R&D expense was approximately $43 million in 2020, $44 million in 2019, and $46 million in 2018. Our R&D expense represents investment in new product development and innovation. Our R&D is further supplemented by technical support services to assist our customers with application development and co-creation.
​

Sales and Distribution
​
Our salaried sales personnel, who are generally dedicated to customers in a geographic region, sell our products directly to manufacturers and distributors. In addition, we have staff that provide technical support to our sales personnel on an industry basis. We generally contract with trucking companies to deliver our bulk products to customer destinations. In North America, we generally use trucks to ship to nearby customers. For those customers located considerable distances from our manufacturing facilities, we use either rail or a combination of railcars and trucks to deliver our products. We generally lease railcars for terms of three to ten years.
​
Patents, Trademarks, and Technical License Agreements
​
We owned more than 1,750 and 750 patents and patents pending as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which relate to a variety of products and processes, and a number of established trademarks under which we market our products. We also have the right to use other patents and trademarks pursuant to patent and trademark licenses. We do not believe that any individual patent or trademark is material to our business. There is no currently pending challenge to the use or registration of any of our patents or trademarks that would have a material negative impact on our business or our results of operations if decided in a manner adverse to us.
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 12,000 employees, of whom approximately 2,600 were located in the U.S. As of the same date, approximately 31 percent of our U.S. employees and 32 percent of our total Company employees were unionized.
​
The following table provides additional information about our employees as of December 31, 2020.

​
We believe that our future growth and innovation depend on a company culture that values and promotes diversity and inclusion. Our diverse and inclusive workforce fuels our high-performance culture and attracts and helps us to retain top talent and sustain our competitive advantage. 
​
We leverage the diverse experience and skills of our Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) to help inform our business strategy. Our BRGs, such as Alliance of Black Employees, Women of Ingredion Network, and PRIDE for our LGBTQ+ cohorts, are integral in maintaining and improving a culture of inclusion and belonging at Ingredion. We have implemented BRGs across our global operations. Our BRGs play an essential role in connecting employees across regions and providing them with opportunities to enhance cultural awareness and enable collaboration.
​
In addition, we have joined the Paradigm for Parity® coalition, pledging our commitment to achieving gender parity in corporate leadership roles by 2030. Currently, both the Company’s Board of Directors and its Executive Leadership team are comprised of more than 25% women. The Paradigm for Parity Action Plan is to significantly increase the number of women in senior operating roles.
​

To continue to attract, develop, and retain top talent, the Company employs a variety of tools and strategies to assess capabilities, identify skills gaps and provide growth and advancement opportunities based on the needs of the business and our employees. Our total approach to compensation and benefits rewards our employees based on the overall contribution to the business. In addition, we regularly assess employee engagement levels and proactively seek continuous improvement in the workplace.
​
Government Regulation
​
As a manufacturer and marketer of food items and items for use in the pharmaceutical industry, our operations and the use of many of our products are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local statutes and regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act. We and many of our products are also subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Among other things, applicable regulations prescribe requirements and establish standards for product quality, purity, and labeling. Failure to comply with one or more regulatory requirements can result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines. No such fines of a material nature were imposed on us in 2020. We may also be required to comply with federal, state, foreign, and local laws regulating food handling and storage. We believe these laws and regulations have not negatively affected our competitive position.
​
Our operations are also subject to various federal, state, foreign, and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air and water quality, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. We operate industrial boilers that fire natural gas, coal, or biofuels to operate our manufacturing facilities and they, along with product dryers, are our primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. In Argentina, we are in discussions with local regulators addressing our possible undertaking to conduct studies of possible environmental remediation programs at our Chacabuco manufacturing facility. We are unable to predict the outcome of these discussions, but do not believe that the ultimate cost of remediation will be material. 
​
During 2020, we spent approximately $12 million for environmental control and wastewater treatment equipment to be incorporated into existing facilities and in planned construction projects. We currently anticipate that we will invest approximately $26 million for environmental facilities and programs in 2021.
​
Based on current laws and regulations and the enforcement and interpretations thereof, we do not expect that the costs of future environmental compliance will be a material expense, although there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance or that the costs of remaining in compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.
