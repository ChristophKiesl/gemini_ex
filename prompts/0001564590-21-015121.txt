Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We have developed our WattUp® wireless power technology, consisting of proprietary semiconductor chipsets, software controls, hardware designs and antennas, that enables radio frequency (“RF”) based charging for electronic devices. The WattUp technology has a broad spectrum of capabilities, including near field wireless charging and at-a-distance wireless charging at various distances. In November 2016 we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Dialog Semiconductor plc (“Dialog”), an industry leader in Bluetooth low energy semiconductors and power management semiconductors. In conjunction with the Strategic Alliance Agreement, Dialog manufactures and is the exclusive distributor of integrated circuit (“IC”) products that incorporate our designs and provides sales and logistic support to customers on a global basis. We believe our proprietary WattUp technologies are well suited for many applications, including home automation, surface and implanted medical devices, electronic shelf labels, industrial IoT sensors, tracking devices, hearables, wearables, consumer electronics, public safety and military applications. Potential future applications include smartphones, commercial and industrial robotics, as well as automotive solutions and other devices with charging requirements that would otherwise require battery replacement or a wired power connection.
 We believe our technology is innovative in its approach, in that we are developing solutions that charge electronic devices with an RF energy zone. We are developing solutions that deliver wire-free energy for near field charging applications and are also developing at-a-distance charging at distances up to approximately three feet, as well as low-power charging for distances up to 15 feet and beyond, some of which involve mobility charging. 
 To-date, we have developed multiple transmitters and receivers, including prototypes as well as partner production designs. The transmitters vary based on form factor, power specifications and frequencies, while the receivers are designed for applications including Bluetooth tracking tags, IoT sensors, hearing aids, electronic shelf

labels, fitness bands, health sensors and devices, smartwatches, smartphones, smartglasses, industrial applications, keyboards, mice, headsets, earbuds, headphones, and more. 
 We have engagements with companies in the consumer electronics (CE), industrial, military and medical device markets that are in the both evaluation and product cycle pre-production stages of integrating WattUp-technology into devices being developed for the end-user. The first end product featuring our technology entered the market in 2019 and we expect additional WattUp enabled products to be announced and launched in 2021. We are also in discussions with potential customers in the consumer and industrial spaces that are considering our solutions to supply low power distance charging for products that could enter the market in 2022.
 In December 2017, we announced Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) certification of our first-generation WattUp Mid Field transmitter, which simultaneously powers multiple devices at a distance of up to three feet. This transmitter underwent rigorous, multi-month testing to verify that it met consumer safety and regulatory requirements. We believe this was the first certification of a Part 18 FCC-approved non-contact wireless charging transmitter, and that it establishes engineering design precedents that can streamline future regulatory approvals for our technology and for our customers’ end-products that employ our technology. 
 Our technology solution consists principally of transmitter controller ICs, power amplifier ICs and receiver ICs, as well as novel antenna designs, application prototypes and proprietary software algorithms. We submitted our first IC design for wafer fabrication in 2013 and since then have developed subsequent generations of transmitter and receiver ICs, antenna designs, and software algorithms.  We have endeavored to optimize our technology by reducing size and cost, while at the same time increasing performance which enables our designs to be integrated into a broad range of devices. We have developed a “building block” approach that allows us to scale our product implementations by combining multiple transmitter building blocks or multiple receiver building blocks to meet the power, distance, size and cost requirements of customer applications requirements. Our technology is readily scalable because the same ICs that are used for contact-based charging can be used for distance-based charging solutions. We have developed two classes of chip solutions, a CMOS-based technology focused on low cost, small footprint and low power (less than 5 watts) and a GaAs/GaN-based technology capable of delivering higher power with greater efficiency. We intend to continue to invest in research and development with high power capabilities of 20 watts and beyond at high levels of efficiency. We also intend to continue to invest in improving product performance, efficiency, cost-performance, integration and miniaturization as required to reach multiple markets and expand the power-at-a-distance ecosystem, while maintaining a technology lead on potential competitors. 
 We sell evaluation kits to potential customers of our technology, to allow their respective engineering and product management departments to test and evaluate the technology. Our customers’ product development, technology integration and product introduction cycles occur over multiple quarters and generally more than a year to two years can elapse before first evaluation and final shipment of the customer’s product. Once our customers begin to sell products to end customers that incorporate our technology, we would expect the commercialization cycle to shorten over time as the technology matures and market acceptance grows.
 We maintain exclusive rights to all intellectual property in our technology. We have implemented an aggressive intellectual property strategy and are continuing to pursue patent protection for new innovations. As of March 1, 2021, the Energous IP portfolio contained 231 awarded patents organized along five (5) critical paths to implementation that we believe a competitor may have to navigate to commercialize WPT technology. The paths are: Processing Algorithms, Antenna Designs, Transmitter and Receiver ASICs, Other Software Controls (e.g., Bluetoothâ Management and Hardware (e.g., Board Layout). Further, the company has more than 65 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. In addition to the inventions covered by these patents, we have also identified specific inventions that we believe are novel and patentable. We intend to file for patent protection for the most valuable of these, and for other inventions that we expect to develop. This is a significant annual expense and we continually monitor the costs and benefits of each patent application and pursue those that we believe are most protective for our business and expand the core value of the Company.
 Our seasoned management team has both private and public company experience, as well as relevant industry experience. In addition, we have identified and hired key engineering resources in the areas of IC development, antenna development, hardware, software and firmware engineering as well as integration and testing, which will allow us to continue to expand our technology and intellectual property and to meet our customers’ support requirements.

Our common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “WATT”. As of February 28, 2021, we had 54 full-time employees, 43 of whom were engineers. We were incorporated in Delaware in 2012. Our corporate headquarters is located at 3590 North First Street, Suite 210, San Jose, CA 95134. Our website can be accessed at www.energous.com. The information contained on, or that may be obtained from our website, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Technology 
 The wire-free charging technology we are developing employs transmitter technology that creates an RF energy zone around a fixed or mobile receiving device.
 Figure 1 below shows a basic conceptual design of a mid-field wireless charging solution based on our technology. Today this technology is able to send RF energy from the transmitter to single receiving device, or to multiple receiving devices.
Figure 1: Concept of a Mid Field Wire-Free Charging Solution    
 

First, our proprietary transmitter technology locates the target receiver(s) using standard Bluetooth® communications and our proprietary technology. Our software controls then cause the transmitter to generate a controlled RF-waveform. Receivers equipped with our antennas and ICs, and controlled by our software, are able to harvest power from the RF energy zone. We believe that our receiver technology will be incorporated into devices such as Bluetooth tracking tags, IoT sensors, hearing aids, electronic shelf labels, fitness bands, health sensors and devices, smartwatches, smartphones, smartglasses, industrial applications, keyboards, mice, headsets, earbuds, headphones, and other small electronics that contain embedded batteries or super capicators.

Our small form factor antennas and one transmitter to many receivers capabilities  represent significant advantages over larger, costly coils required for first generation inductive based, contact WPT implementations. The one to many capabilities of the WattUp technology can be of significant benefit to OEM’s with broad product lines like hearing aid manufacturers where a single transmitter can support multiple SKUs for behind the ear, in the ear and in the canal devices substantially reducing development, manufacturing and support costs. 
 

Our current generation ICs have significantly reduced the size and cost of both transmitter technology and our receiver technology, and products under development are designed to further reduce size and cost.  In addition, our ICs are designed for both lower-power and higher-power applications, efficiency and faster synchronization, while working within the constraints of multiple international regulatory environments. 
 In 2016, we introduced our WattUp Near Field Transmitter Technology and a small form factor receiver, which were developed as a result of our efforts to reduce cost and size. This contact-based charging solution, for which we have received FCC approval, allowed for low power charging at up to five millimeters. In 2017, we announced a higher-power version of our WattUp Near Field Transmitter technology, with the ability to charge on contact at levels of up to 10 watts. In February 2019, we announced that our latest WattUp Near Field High Power transmitter technology supports up to 20 watts of charging power. Due to its low cost and small size, the miniature transmitter can be bundled in-box with WattUp-enabled receiver devices, replacing alternative charging solutions like power adapters and charging cables. We expect adoption of our low cost, portable charging solution for receiver devices to continue to advance.
 Our Competition 
 Competing methods for charging battery-powered devices include wall plug-in charging, inductive charging, magnetic resonance charging, charging stations and more. To our knowledge, almost all consumer electronics equipped with a rechargeable battery come bundled with a charging method, such as a power cord. Studies indicate that consumers prefer wire-free, or untethered, charging solutions such as our WattUp technology. We believe the advantages of our WattUp technology including size, cost, mobility, foreign object detection and portability coupled with the unique capability to charge devices both on contact as well as at-a-distance in a fully compatible ecosystem will foster broad adoption of the technology over time. 
 A variety of wireless charging technologies are on the market or under development today. These competitive technologies fall into the following categories: 
 Magnetic Induction. Magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance, which can transmit energy over very short distances. Essentially this is a contact technology whereby the transmitter and receiver need to be closely aligned to charge. Power is delivered as a function of coil size (the larger the coil, the more power), and coils must be directly paired (one receiver coil to one transmitter coil = directly coupled pair).  Products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for 10+ years in products such as rechargeable electronic toothbrushes.

Magnetic Resonance. Magnetic resonance is similar to magnetic induction, as it uses magnetic coils to transmit energy. This technology uses coils that range in size depending on the power levels being transmitted. It has the ability to transmit power at distances up to ~11 inches (30cm) which can be increased with the use of resonance repeaters. 
 Conductive. Conductive charging uses conductive power transfer to eliminate wires between the charger (often a charging mat) and the charging device. It requires the use of a charging board as the power transmitter to deliver the power, and a charging device, with a built-in receiver, to receive the power. This technology requires direct metal contact between the charging board and the receiver. Once the charging board recognizes the receiver, the charging begins. 
 RF Harvesting. Harvesting RF energy is at the core of our WattUp technology. Radio Frequency wireless charging is unique in that it sends radio waves over the air to a receiver that harvests the waves and converts them to power, thereby enabling the device to operate in its intended fashion without the need to connect directly to a power source. RF harvesting typically utilizes directional antennas to target and deliver energy. 
 Laser. Laser charging technology uses very short wavelengths of light to create a collimated beam that maintains its size over distance, using what is described as distributed resonance to deliver power to an optical receiver. 
 Ultrasound. Ultrasound charging technology converts electric energy into acoustic energy in the form of ultrasound waves. It then reconverts those waves through an “energy-harvesting” receiver. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Pursuant to our Strategic Alliance Agreement, Dialog manufactures and distributes IC products incorporating our wire-free charging technology. Dialog is the exclusive supplier of these products, which we believe may be useful in several vertical markets with large volumes of potential annual sales. Our strategy is to support the development and proliferation of our WattUp® technology to form a ubiquitous wire-free charging ecosystem. 
 We believe that a large market opportunity lies in wire-free low-power charging at-a-distance, which might develop as the Wi-Fi ecosystem developed. The goal is to ensure interoperability between transmitters and receivers that are based on our technology, regardless of who made them, installed them into finished goods, or marketed them. The implementation of previous ubiquitous solutions, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, illustrates our goal. For example, Wi-Fi routers, regardless of their designer or manufacturer, work with Wi-Fi receivers installed in consumer electronics, regardless of manufacturer. Accordingly, in partnership with Dialog, we endeavor to: 
  
• | Build multiple ICs to advance the technology;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Partner with leading product companies;
--+----------------------------------------


• | Develop reference designs to reduce early adopter risks, enable easier integration at lower costs and foster adoption;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide game-changing benefits to the consumer in terms of utility and convenience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design initial iterations of the technology to be small but scalable implementations that are compatible on both a local and enterprise scale;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in ease of use;
--+-----------------------


• | Develop a strategy to build out the ecosystem in consumer, enterprise, industrial and military;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implement a plan to initially sell ICs migrating to a combination of selling ICs and integrating our device libraries into third-party silicon such as Bluetooth Low Energy and Power Management Chips;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop and execute on a strategy to gain global regulatory approval for both contact-based charging and distance charging; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support the AirFuel™ Alliance (AFA) that is expected to lead to a qualification process to ensure compatibility of our WattUp technology across vendors and develop a common user experience at the application level.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order for our technology to become a ubiquitous solution for charging at-a-distance, we intend to pursue an ecosystem strategy for our technology, engaging not only potential customers for our transmitter, receiver and power amplifier IC’s but also their upstream and downstream value chain partners. We intend to capitalize on our first-to-market advantage and prioritize protection of our intellectual property portfolio, as we believe this strategy will make it less likely that a competing platform will be able to gain a solid foothold in the RF-based wireless charging market and compete with our technology in a meaningful way. 
We believe our strategic relationship with Dialog has the potential to enable us to accelerate and increase the breadth of penetration in multiple markets rather than by manufacturing and distributing products ourselves. We believe this relationship allows us to resolve supply chain problems for consumer electronics and IoT companies as well as leverage Dialog’s sales force while we concentrate our efforts and resources on engineering, development and commercialization projects to accelerate the introduction and adoption of WattUp solutions. 
 To engage with potential customers of the WattUp IC’s, we have developed evaluation kits consisting of a transmitter and a receiver along with the enabling software to allow potential strategic partners to test the technology in their labs. The kits form a base “building block” component that is scalable to meet the needs of specific applications. We are developing processes and support capabilities to assist potential customers as they evaluate the technology and develop specific designs to incorporate it.
 To validate our technology, we originally sought out customers that were smaller, more nimble early adopters with relatively short product cycles and the ability to ship fully integrated WattUp enabled devices to the consumer as quickly as possible. At the same time, we began to engage with larger, top tier customers with the ability to ship WattUp enabled consumer and IoT devices in mass quantities. We are also engaged with companies that have much longer product cycles in multiple vertical markets As our partnership with Dialog enters its fifth year, the majority of new customer introductions are made through Dialog, comprised of companies diverse in size and end markets.
 Since we are developing a new electronics charging paradigm for consumers, we expect many operational details of our strategy to continue to evolve as our technology matures, engineering breakthroughs occur and our engagements with our strategic partner Dialog and our top tier customers advance and mature. 
 Our Target Markets 
 We categorize our target markets as transmitter markets and receiver markets. 
 Transmitter Target Markets 
 Transmitters are devices that broadcast RF energy that can be accessed by WattUp-enabled receivers in consumer electronics. We believe our transmitter technology will be developed and released in three basic categories: 

• | Stand-alone transmitters that are either sold independently or bundled as part of a pairing with WattUp-enabled receiver devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transmitters that are integrated into third party industrial, military medical and consumer devices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transmitters that could be integrated into Wi-Fi routers to form a single device that provides both connectivity and wire-free power for a particular area.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We plan to release stand-alone and integrated transmitter technology in three categories: 
 WattUp Near Field Transmitters: 
 Because of its advantages over other forms of contact-based wireless charging, including incorporation into multiple form factors and potential compatibility with future distance transmitters, we expect transmitters using our WattUp Near Field technology to be the first WattUp enabled transmitter products on the market. These contact-based charging solutions are ideally suited for many electronic devices in both consumer and industrial markets such as wearables, IoT devices and other small electronics that require a small form factor receiver and a low-cost charging solution. They are also suitable for larger, more power-hungry devices such as smartphones, smart watches and tablets. Initially these transmitters will be one-to-one (one transmitter to one receiver), with future versions being single transmitters for multiple receivers.

WattUp Mid Field Transmitter 
 We expect that transmitters using our WattUp Mid Field technology will be geared to consumer desktop and industrial, military and medical markets and for charging at a range of a few centimeters to one meter. We also intend for the Mid Field transmitters to have tracking ability to support mobile applications and multiple receiving devices. WattUp Mid Field transmitters may include small transmitters designed to power industrial, medical, military and consumer electronics and IoT devices. The same technology may also be integrated into third party devices such as smart speakers, computer monitors, nightstand consumer electronics, accessories such as low voltage portable battery chargers and integrated automotive applications, as well as additional industrial, medical, and public safety applications.
WattUp Far Field Transmitters: 
 Transmitters based on WattUp Far Field technology are expected to provide low power charging for multiple devices within a radius of up to 15 feet or greater depending on application. We expect that Far Field WattUp transmitters will have the ability to both “target” receivers at-a-distance as well as broadcast wireless power creating a sphere of  power within which WattUp enabled receiving devices can be charged.  Far Field WattUp transmitters may play a significant role in the charging low power IoT devices in fixed locations – such as security cameras and sensors.
Transmitters Integrated into Third Party Devices:
 The “building block” core architecture developed for the WattUp technology is suited to a broad range of third party devices in both industrial and consumer markets. The flexibility of the architecture in terms of size, power, distance, and cost affords Energous customers the opportunity to match our technology with specific requirements and limitations typically found with complex integrations. For example, the WattUp transmit technology could be integrated into a WiFi router on the ceiling of a manufacturing floor or hospital ward providing both internet connectivity and wireless power to any devices within range. 
 Wi-Fi Routers 
 We see the combination of the wire-free power router and the Wi-Fi router as a natural integration point and a synergistic application of both technologies. A WattUp transmitter shares a number of technical characteristics with Wi-Fi routers in that both devices operate in the airwaves in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical bands, both devices owe their success to the utility and convenience they bring to the consumer, both devices rely on antennas, and both devices “pair” or provide hand off capabilities which allow for mesh networks to provision large sites. We believe that our technology is applicable to both the commercial and residential Wi-Fi router markets. 
 As part of our go-to-market strategy under the Strategic Alliance Agreement, we are currently working with Dialog to identify potential customers to offer consumer and commercial applications of our transmitter technology. 
 Receiver Target Markets 
 We believe there are many potential uses for our receiver technology, including: 
  
• | Wearables
--+----------


• | Hearing aids
--+-------------


• | IOT devices including asset trackers, sensors, retail displays, security devices
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smartphones

 •Peripheral devices such as computer mice and keyboards 
  
• | Remote controls
--+----------------


• | Rechargeable lights
--+--------------------


• | Gaming consoles and controllers
--+--------------------------------


• | Smart Home, Medical, Industrial, Military and other Sensors
--+------------------------------------------------------------

• | Rechargeable batteries
--+-----------------------


• | Automotive accessories

 •Smart textiles
  
• | Electronic shelf labeling
--+--------------------------


• | Logistics and asset tracking tags and sensors
--+----------------------------------------------


• | Hand-held industrial devices (such as scanners and keypads)
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Military and Public Safety devices
--+-----------------------------------


• | Medical devices
--+----------------

 
This list is meant to be illustrative only; we cannot guarantee that we will address any of these markets, and we may decide to address a market that is not on the list. We intend to continue to evaluate our target markets and choose new markets based on factors including (but not limited to) time-to-market, market size and growth, and the strength of our value proposition for a specific application. 
 Key Strategic Relationship 
 In November 2016, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Dialog for the manufacture and distribution of IC products incorporating our wire-free charging technology. Dialog is our exclusive supplier of these products for specified fields of use. Our WattUp chipsets are ordered through and manufactured by Dialog, carry the Dialog brand and are shipped and supported by Dialog. Dialog agreed to not distribute, sell or work with any third party to develop any competing products without our approval. Energous and Dialog agreed on a revenue sharing arrangement and will collaborate on the commercialization of licensed products based on a mutually-agreed upon plan. 
 Our WattUp technology uses Bluetooth solutions, including Dialog’s SmartBond® Bluetooth low energy solution, as the out-of-band communications channel between the wireless transmitter and receiver. Dialog’s power management technology is used to distribute power from the WattUp receiver IC to the rest of the device while Dialog’s AC/DC Rapid Charge™ power conversion technology delivers power to the wireless transmitter.
 Our Intellectual Property 
 As a company primarily focused on licensing, we expect that our most valuable asset will be our intellectual property. This includes U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and know-how. We have implemented an aggressive intellectual property strategy and are continuing to pursue patent protection for new innovations. As of March 1, 2021, the Energous IP portfolio contained 231 awarded patents organized along five (5) critical paths to implementation that we believe a competitor may have to navigate to commercialize WPT technology. The paths are: Processing Algorithms, Antenna Designs, Transmitter and Receiver ASICs, Other Software Controls (e.g., Bluetoothâ Management and Hardware (e.g., Board Layout). Further, the company has more than 65 pending patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. We intend to file for patent protection for the most valuable of these, as well as for other new inventions that we expect to develop. This is a significant annual expense and we continually monitor the costs and benefits of each patent application and pursue those that we believe are most protective for our business and expand the core value of the Company.
Government Regulation 
 Our wire-free charging technology involves the transmission of power using RF energy, which is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), international regulators and may be subject to regulation by other federal, state, local and international agencies. Our technology has been tested against U.S. and international safety requirements which has consistently demonstrated that our technology is safe. We continue to work with regulatory bodies to establish processes, standards and spectrum allocation to ensure devices incorporating WattUp® technology can secure required domestic and international approvals. 
 8


As part of the regulatory approval process, devices incorporating the WattUp® technology must obtain approvals under FCC Part 15 and/or FCC Part 18 in the U.S., depending on the specific application. Energous has received Part 15 and Part 18 FCC approvals for WattUp enabled products and has received regulatory approvals from many international agencies.
