Item 1. | Business

INTRODUCTION
Coeur Mining, Inc. (“Coeur”,“the Company”, or "we") is a gold and silver producer with mines located in the United States, Mexico, and Bolivia and exploration projects in Mexico and Argentina. The Company operates the Palmarejo complex, the Rochester, Kensington, Wharf, and San Bartolomé mines, and also owns Coeur Capital, which is primarily comprised of the Endeavor silver stream.  The Company’s principal sources of revenue are its operating mines and, to a lesser extent, the Endeavor silver stream.
Coeur was incorporated as an Idaho corporation in 1928 under the name Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation. On May 16, 2013, Coeur changed its state of incorporation from the State of Idaho to the State of Delaware and changed its name to Coeur Mining, Inc.
OVERVIEW OF MINING PROPERTIES AND INTERESTS
The Company’s operating properties and interests are described below:

• | Coeur owns 100% of Coeur Mexicana S.A. de C.V. ("Coeur Mexicana"), which has operated the underground and surface Palmarejo silver and gold mine (the “Palmarejo mine”) in Mexico since 2009. Coeur Mexicana controls a large land position around its existing operations, including the adjacent San Miguel project acquired from Paramount Gold and Silver Corp. ("Paramount") in April 2015. The combined property now consists of (1) the Palmarejo mine and mill; (2) the Guadalupe underground mine, located about 8 kilometers southeast of the Palmarejo mine; (3) the Independencia underground mine, located approximately 800 meters northeast of the Guadalupe underground mine, and (4) other nearby deposits and exploration targets (together, the “Palmarejo complex”). The Palmarejo complex produced 4.4 million ounces of silver and 73,913 ounces of gold in 2016. 

In 2009, Coeur Mexicana entered into a gold production royalty with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation covering 50% of life of mine gold production for the portion of the Palmarejo complex owned by Coeur Mexicana prior to completion of the Paramount acquisition (the “Coeur Mexicana Property”). In July 2016 the gold production royalty terminated effective upon completion of a minimum ounce delivery requirement and, subsequently, a new gold stream agreement with a subsidiary of Franco-Nevada Corporation became effective.

• | Coeur owns 100% of Coeur Rochester, Inc. ("Coeur Rochester"), which has operated the Rochester mine, a silver and gold surface mining operation located in northwestern Nevada, since 1986. The Rochester mine produced 4.6 million ounces of silver and 50,751 ounces of gold in 2016. Coeur Rochester is obligated to pay a 3.4% net smelter returns ("NSR") royalty on up to 39.4 million silver equivalent ounces produced and sold from a portion of the Rochester mine. 


• | Coeur owns 100% of Coeur Alaska, Inc. ("Coeur Alaska"), which has operated the Kensington mine, an underground gold mine located north of Juneau, Alaska since 2010. Kensington produced 124,331 ounces of gold in 2016.


• | Coeur owns 100% of Wharf Resources (U.S.A.) Inc. ("Wharf"), which operates the Wharf mine, an open-pit gold mine located near Lead, South Dakota. The Wharf mine is located in the Black Hills mining district of South Dakota and has been in production for over 30 years, during which it has produced over 2.1 million ounces of gold. Coeur acquired Wharf in February 2015 from Goldcorp Inc. for cash consideration of $99.4 million. The Wharf mine produced 109,175 ounces of gold in 2016. 


• | Coeur owns 100% of Empresa Minera Manquiri S.A. ("Manquiri"), a Bolivian company that controls the mining rights for the San Bartolomé mine, which is a surface silver mine in Bolivia where Coeur commenced commercial production in 2008. The San Bartolomé mine produced 5.5 million ounces of silver in 2016.


• | Coeur owns 100% of Coeur Capital, Inc. (“Coeur Capital”), which holds the Endeavor silver stream. The silver stream arrangement, entered into in 2005 allows Coeur to buy 100% of silver production up to 20.0 million ounces from the Endeavor mine, an underground zinc, lead, and silver mine which has been in production since 1983 operated by Cobar Operations Pty. Limited, for an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver, indexed annually for inflation, plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $7.00 per ounce. The Endeavor mine produced 0.2 million ounces of silver in 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Company has received a total of 6.2 million ounces under the stream agreement. Coeur Capital also holds other non-producing royalties and strategic investments. 


• | Coeur owns 100% of the La Preciosa silver-gold exploration project in the State of Durango, Mexico.

3


• | Coeur owns 100% of the Joaquin silver-gold exploration project located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. In January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Joaquin silver-gold exploration project for total consideration of $25.0 million. The Company will also retain a 2.0% net smelter returns ("NSR") royalty on the Joaquin project. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.

The Company also has interests in exploration stage properties located in the United States, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and Mexico which have no declared resources or mineralized material. For financial and geographic information regarding our operating segments, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
SILVER AND GOLD PRICES
The Company’s operating results are substantially dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold, which fluctuate widely. The volatility of such prices is illustrated in the following table, which sets forth the high and low prices of silver based on the London Bullion Market Association ("LBMA") Silver Price, formerly known as the silver fix, and gold based on the PM LBMA Gold Price, formerly known as the PM gold fix:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014
 | High | | Low | High | | Low | High | Low 
Silver | $ | 20.71 | | $ | 13.58 | | $18.23 | $13.71 | $22.05 | $15.28
Gold | $ | 1,366 | | $ | 1,077 | | $1,296 | $1,049 | $1,385 | $1,142

MARKETING
All of the Company's mining operations produce silver and/or gold doré except the Kensington and Wharf mines, which produce a gold concentrate. The Endeavor mine, in which Coeur Capital holds a silver stream, produces lead and zinc concentrates with a high silver content, from which the Company recovers its payable silver. The Company uses a geographically diverse group of third-party refiners and smelters in the United States, China, and Japan.
The Company's doré, as well as the concentrate product produced by the Wharf mine, is refined into gold and silver bullion according to benchmark standards set by the LBMA, which regulates the acceptable requirements for bullion traded in the London precious metals markets. The Company then sells its silver and gold bullion to multi-national banks, bullion trading houses, and refiners across the globe. The Company has eleven trading counterparties at December 31, 2016. The Company's sales of doré and concentrate product produced by the Wharf mine amounted to approximately 77%, 74%, and 63% of total metal sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Generally, the loss of a single bullion trading counterparty would not adversely affect the Company due to the liquidity of the markets and availability of alternative trading counterparties.
The Company's concentrate produced by the Kensington mine is sold to smelters under purchase and sale agreements, and the smelters pay the Company for the gold and silver recovered from the concentrates. The concentrate was sold to two smelters at December 31, 2016. The Company's sales of concentrate produced by the Kensington mine amounted to approximately 23%, 26%, and 37% of total metal sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. While the loss of a smelter may have a material adverse effect if alternate smelters are not available or if the failure to engage a new smelter results in a delay in the sale or purchase of Kensington concentrate, the Company believes that there is sufficient global capacity available to address the loss of a smelter.
HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company’s strategy is to provide stockholders with exposure to silver and gold prices by selling silver and gold production at market prices. The Company may enter into short-term derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated silver and gold production and to manage risks associated with foreign currencies. For additional information see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 12 -- Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
General
The Company’s activities are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species and other matters. The costs to comply with such regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and continued operation of the Company’s properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, the Company must comply with known standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays. Although the Company has been recognized for its commitment to environmental responsibility and believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, amendments to current laws and regulations, more stringent application or interpretation of these laws and regulations through judicial review, or administrative action or the adoption of new laws could have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its results of operations.
Estimated future reclamation costs are based primarily on legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2016, $97.4 million was accrued for reclamation costs relating to currently developed and producing properties. The Company is also involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former mining activities. Based upon the Company’s best estimate of its liabilities for these items, $1.9 million was accrued at December 31, 2016. These amounts are included in Reclamation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Federal Environmental Laws
Certain mining wastes from extraction and beneficiation of ores would be considered hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state law equivalents, but are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste. If the Company’s mine wastes were treated as hazardous waste under RCRA or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as “Superfund” sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state law equivalents for cleanup, material expenditures could be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities, for other remediation expenditures, or for natural resource damages. Under CERCLA, any present or past owners or operators of a Superfund site generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government’s cleanup efforts. Such owners or operators may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon the Company’s operations, tailings, and waste disposal areas, as well as upon mine closure, in Alaska, Nevada, and South Dakota under federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including, without limitation, CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and state law equivalents. The Company has reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and does not believe it to have a material effect on its operations. Future changes in federal or state laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect upon the Company and its results of operations.
U.S. Mining Legislation
A portion of the Company’s U.S. mining properties are on unpatented mining claims on federal lands. Legislation has been introduced regularly in the U.S. Congress over the last decade to change the Mining Law of 1872 as amended (the "Mining Law"), under which the Company holds these unpatented mining claims. It is possible that the Mining Law may be amended or replaced by less favorable legislation in the future. Previously proposed legislation contained a production royalty obligation, new environmental standards and conditions, additional reclamation requirements and extensive new procedural steps which would likely result in delays in permitting. The ultimate content of future proposed legislation, if enacted, is uncertain. If a royalty on unpatented mining claims were imposed, the profitability of the Company’s U.S. operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") have considered revising regulations governing operations under the Mining Law on federal lands they administer, which, if implemented, may result in additional procedures and environmental conditions and standards on those lands. The majority of the Company’s operations are either outside of the United States or on private patented lands and would be unaffected by potential legislation.
Any such reform of the Mining Law or BLM and U.S. Forest Service regulations thereunder could increase the costs of mining activities on unpatented mining claims, or could materially impair the ability of the Company to develop or continue operations which derive ore from federal lands, and as a result, could have an adverse effect on the Company and its results of operations. Until such time, if any, as new reform legislation or regulations are enacted, the ultimate effects and costs of compliance on the Company cannot be estimated.

Foreign Government Regulations
Bolivia, where the San Bartolomé mine is located, and Mexico, where the Palmarejo complex and the La Preciosa exploration project are located, have both adopted laws and guidelines for environmental permitting that are similar to those in effect in the United States. The permitting process requires a thorough study to determine the baseline condition of the mining site and surrounding area, an environmental impact analysis, and proposed mitigation measures to minimize and offset the environmental impact of mining operations. The Company has received all permits required to operate the San Bartolomé mine and Palmarejo complex as currently conducted, and has received all permits necessary for the exploration activities being conducted at its other non-U.S. properties.
Maintenance of Claims 
United States
At mining properties in the United States, including the Rochester, Kensington, and Wharf mines, operations are conducted upon both patented and unpatented mining claims. Pursuant to applicable federal law, it is necessary to pay to the Secretary of the Interior, on or before September 1st of each year, a claim maintenance fee of $155 per unpatented federal claim. This claim maintenance fee is in lieu of the assessment work requirement contained in applicable mining laws. In addition, Nevada holders of unpatented federal mining claims are required to pay the county recorder of the county in which the claim is situated an annual fee of $10.00 per claim. In South Dakota, holders of unpatented federal mining claims are required to pay the county recorder of the county in which the claim is situated an annual fee of $0.25 per claim. In Alaska, the Company is required to pay a variable, annual rental fee for State claims and a State upland mining lease based on the age of the claim or claims converted to the upland mining lease. Annual labor must also be performed or an annual payment in lieu of annual labor must be paid to the State of Alaska for State claims and upland mining leases. No maintenance fees are payable for federal patented claims. Patented claims are similar to land held by an owner who is entitled to the entire interest in the property with unconditional power of disposition and are subject to local ad valorem property taxes.
Mexico
In order to carry out mining activities in Mexico, the Company is required to obtain a mining concession from the General Bureau of Mining, which belongs to the Ministry of Economy of the Federal Government, or be assigned previously granted concession rights, and both must be recorded with the Public Registry of Mining. In addition, mining works may have to be authorized by other authorities when performed in certain areas, including ejidos (communal owners of land recognized by the federal laws in Mexico), villages, dams, channels, general communications ways, submarine shelves of islands, islets and reefs, marine beds and subsoil and federal maritime-terrestrial zones. Reports have to be filed with the General Bureau of Mining in May of each year, evidencing previous calendar year mining investment and works. Annual reports, detailing production results, must be submitted by January 30 for each concession bearing production and all concessions over six years of age. Bi-annual mining duties are payable in January and July of each year and, based on amount of surface of each mining concession, holders of mining concessions must also pay annually and no later than the last business day of March a special mining fee based on 7.5% of the income before interest and certain other permitted deductions derived from the transfer or sale of minerals, plus 0.5% of gross revenues from sales of gold, silver and platinum. Failure to pay any of these duties and submit the required reports could lead to cancellation of the concessions. Upon expiration or cancellation of the concession, certain obligations remain, such as filing technical reports and ground support.

Bolivia
The Bolivian state owns the mining rights at San Bartolomé. The Bolivian state-owned mining organization, Corporación Minera de Bolivia (“COMIBOL”), is the underlying manager of all of the mining rights relating to the San Bartolomé mine. Bolivia’s ownership derives from the Supreme Decree 3196 issued in October 1952, when the government nationalized most of the mines in Potosí. COMIBOL has leased the mining rights for the surface silver and tin bearing sediment to several Potosí cooperatives. The cooperatives have subleased their mining rights to Coeur’s subsidiary, Manquiri, through a series of “joint venture” contracts (“JV Agreements”). In addition to those agreements with the cooperatives, Manquiri holds additional mining rights under lease agreements directly with COMIBOL. All of Manquiri’s mining and surface rights collectively constitute the San Bartolomé mine. In response to conflicts between local mining cooperatives and the Bolivian government, on September 1, 2016, the Bolivian government issued Supreme Decree No. 2891, and on October 24, 2016, Law 845, which impose tighter restrictions on mining cooperatives, including reversion of mining areas leased to the mining cooperatives by COMIBOL that are subject to JV Agreements, leases or subleases with third parties to the Bolivian state. Although Bolivian government officials have made public statements that the decree will not impact Manquiri’s ability to continue operations in the areas subject to the JV Agreements and the JV Agreements continue to be formally in existence, any cancellation of leases between COMIBOL and the applicable mining cooperatives and/or the JV Agreements will require negotiation of and entry into contracts directly with COMIBOL to continue mining operations at the affected areas. In January 2017, an interim permit was granted to Manquiri allowing for continuation of mining operations in the areas subject to the JV Agreements pending negotiation of contracts directly with COMIBOL. For additional information regarding the maintenance of its claims to the San Bartolomé mine, see "Item 2. Properties - Silver and Gold Mining Properties, Bolivia-San Bartolomé."
Argentina
In Argentina, minerals are owned by the provincial governments, which impose a maximum 3% mine-mouth royalty on mineral production. The first step in acquiring mining rights is filing an exploration permit, or cateo, which gives exclusive prospecting rights for the requested area for a period of time, generally up to three years. The maximum size of each cateo is 10,000 hectares; a maximum of 20 cateos, or 200,000 hectares, can be held by a single entity in any one province.
The holder of a cateo has exclusive right to establish a discovery concession ("Manifestacion de Descubrimiento" or “MD”) on that cateo, but MDs can also be set without a cateo on any land not covered by another party's cateo. MDs are filed as either a vein or disseminated discovery. A square protection zone can be declared around the discovery of up to 840 hectares for a vein MD, or up to 7,000 hectares for a disseminated MD. The protection zone grants the discoverer exclusive rights for an indefinite period, during which the discoverer must provide an annual report presenting a program of exploration work and investments related to the protection zone. An MD can be upgraded to an exploitation concession ("Concesion de Explotacion" or "Mina"), which gives the holder the right to begin commercial extraction of minerals.
Australia
In Australia, minerals in the ground are owned by the state until severed from the ground through mining operations. At the Endeavor mining property operated by CBH, operations are conducted on designated mining leases issued by the relevant state government mining department. Mining leases are issued for a specific term and include a range of environmental and other conditions including the payment of production royalties, annual lease fees and the use of cash or a bank guarantee as security for reclamation liabilities. The amounts required to be paid to secure reclamation liabilities are determined on a case by case basis. In addition, according to public sources, CBH holds a range of exploration titles and permits, which are also issued by the respective state government mining departments for specified terms and require payment of annual fees and completion of designated expenditure programs to maintain title.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF MINERAL PROPERTIES

Reserves, Resources and Mineralized Material

Coeur Mining, Inc. is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and applicable Canadian securities laws, and as a result we report our mineral reserves according to two different standards. Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”). The definitions of NI 43-101 are adopted from those given by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. U.S. reporting requirements, however, are governed by Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Industry Guide 7 (“Guide 7”). Both sets of reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but embody different approaches and definitions. Under Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.

In our public filings in Canada and in certain other announcements not filed with the SEC, we disclose measured, indicated and inferred resources, each as defined in NI 43-101, in addition to our mineral reserves.  U.S. investors are cautioned that, while the terms “measured mineral resources,” “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources” are recognized and required by Canadian securities laws, Guide 7 does not recognize them.  The estimation of measured resources and indicated resources involve greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic feasibility than the estimation of proven and probable reserves, and therefore U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into Guide 7 compliant reserves.  The estimation of inferred resources involves far greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic viability than the estimation of other categories of resources, and therefore it cannot be assumed that all or any part of inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically.

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") and in our other filings with the SEC, we modify our estimates made in compliance with NI 43-101 to conform to Guide 7 for reporting in the United States. In this Form 10-K, we use the term “mineralized material” to describe mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute “reserves” under U.S. standards. “Mineralized material” is substantially equivalent to measured and indicated mineral resources (exclusive of reserves) as disclosed for reporting purposes in Canada, except that the SEC only permits issuers to report "mineralized material" in tonnage and average grade without reference to contained ounces. We provide disclosure of mineralized material to allow a means of comparing our projects to those of other companies in the mining industry, many of which are Canadian and report pursuant to NI 43-101, and to comply with applicable disclosure requirements.  We caution you not to assume that all or any part of mineralized material will ever be converted into Guide 7 compliant reserves.

Technical Reports and Qualified Persons

As required by Canadian securities laws, we hereby notify Canadian investors that the scientific and technical information concerning our mineral projects in this Form 10-K have been reviewed and approved by a “qualified person” under NI 43-101, namely our Director, Technical Services, Christopher Pascoe.  For a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral reserves included in this Form 10-K, as well as data verification procedures and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant factors, Canadian investors may view technical reports prepared for each of our properties as filed on SEDAR at http://www.sedar.com.  Neither the technical reports nor the statements of any qualified person filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities are included in, or incorporated by reference in, this Form 10-K.  Because the definitions and standards of NI 43-101 differ from those of Guide 7, investors are cautioned that information contained in reports prepared pursuant to NI 43-101, like the technical reports, may not be comparable to similar information that we can disclose in this Form 10-K or the other reports we file with the SEC.
