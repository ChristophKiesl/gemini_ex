Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company engaged in the discovery and development of next-generation therapies with an initial focus on treatments for cancer. Our proprietary ImmunoPhage platform is a powerful, self-adjuvanted and highly differentiated immunotherapy approach that is designed to utilize bacteriophage to induce a robust, focused and coordinated innate and adaptive immune response. We are engineering our ImmunoPhage product candidates to directly target antigen presenting cells, or APCs, and modulate the tumor microenvironment, or TME, through the targeted use of nanobodies which further enhances therapeutic activity. We believe our ImmunoPhage platform has the potential to deliver personalized, off-the-shelf product candidates tailored to a patient’s specific tumor. The versatility of our ImmunoPhage platform allows us to design product candidates in a modular fashion, based on a cocktail of common and patient-specific antigens built from our proprietary library of ImmunoPhages, which we refer to as Phortress. We are currently conducting an ongoing 30-patient Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our lead product candidate, SNS-301, in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, as a potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN. As of March 9, 2021, we have enrolled 17 patients in the trial. As of December 10, 2020, we have evaluated ten patients for efficacy and ten for safety. We have observed disease control in seven of the patients evaluable for efficacy, including one patient with a partial response, or PR, and two patients who have achieved longstanding stable disease, or SD, for greater than 36 weeks following treatment. Treatment with SNS-301 has generally been well tolerated. We anticipate reporting a large additional subset of data from this trial by the end of 2021. If the results of this trial are positive, subject to feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we intend to initiate a randomized, registration-enabling trial for SNS-301. We are leveraging the insights from our experience with SNS-301 to expand our development pipeline to include SNS-401 for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma, or MCC, as well as a human monoclonal antibody, or mAb, program targeting the novel immune checkpoint VISTA, or V-set immunoglobulin domain suppressor of T cell activation. 
 Monoclonal antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1, or PD-1, and its related ligand, or PD-L1, have emerged as one of the most promising classes of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. However, in a majority of patients they generally fail to produce meaningful results. Drugs utilizing PD-1 blockade have been approved by the FDA to treat at least 20 different types of cancer and, in 2019, generated sales of approximately $19.4 billion worldwide. By 2024, the total global market for drugs utilizing PD-1 blockade is estimated to exceed $36 billion. Two of the most common reasons for non-response to PD-1 blockade treatment include a lack of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, or the presence of alternate immunosuppressive mechanisms such as VISTA. To address these mechanisms of non-response to PD-1 blockade, there has been considerable focus on the development of therapies that induce the body’s immune system to mount a response towards tumor antigen targets. Our ImmunoPhage platform is designed to address the challenges of converting PD-1 blockade non-responsive tumors into responsive ones by triggering the generation of tumor antigen-specific T cells and circumventing immunosuppressive pathways. 
 Pioneering work with bacteriophage led to our discovery of their utility as a powerful, self-adjuvanted immunotherapy platform. The foundation of ImmunoPhage is the bacteriophage lambda, or lambda phage, which we selected for its native immunostimulatory capabilities, large and tractable genome, and tolerability profile. The highly immunogenic nature of bacteriophage promotes a balanced, coordinated and robust response by both the innate and the cellular and humoral components of the adaptive immune system. We believe that the unique features of bacteriophage, including the ability to generate both T cell responses and B cell mediated antibody responses, give it the potential to be used in the development of differentiated treatments for cancer. The modularity of the ImmunoPhage platform allows for personalized, dynamic substitution of particular phage components to optimize patient therapy. Our creation of a phage cocktail expressing multivalent antigens along with the integration of nanobody technology is designed to enhance the utility, precision and therapeutic activity of our product candidates. This allows for an adaptive clinical trial design, which we have discussed with the FDA. To date, we have constructed over 25 unique ImmunoPhage configurations in-house in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and we are continuing to expand our Phortress library of ImmunoPhages. 
 SNS-301 is an ImmunoPhage product candidate that we are developing as a treatment for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic SCCHN. Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, accounting for approximately 6% of all cancer cases, and is responsible for an estimated 1% to 2% of all cancer deaths. An estimated 650,000 cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide, including approximately 50,000 cases in the United States. Human papilloma virus, or HPV, infection accounts for an estimated 70% of SCCHN cases in the United States. The current standard of care in our target patient population is PD-1 inhibition as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Despite improvements in diagnoses and disease management, long-term survival rates for patients with SCCHN have not increased significantly over the past 30 years and are among the lowest for major cancers. 
 1

We selected SCCHN as our first indication based on a high unmet patient need, robust scientific rationale, a clearly defined regulatory path and accessibility of these tumors for biopsy. SNS-301 has been engineered to produce a targeted immune response against the tumor associated antigen, or TAA, aspartate β-hydroxylase or ASPH. ASPH is found to be overexpressed in 70% to 90% of human malignancies, including SCCHN. Expression of ASPH is related to cancer cell growth, invasiveness, and disease progression through the Notch signaling pathway. As SCCHN tumors are often lacking intratumoral CD8 T cells, we believe that the addition of SNS-301 has the potential to generate and expand ASPH specific anti-tumor T cells and thereby enhance PD-1 blockade activity. 
 We are currently evaluating SNS-301 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in a 30-patient Phase 1/2 clinical trial. As of March 9, 2021, we have enrolled 17 patients in the trial. As of December 10, 2020, we have evaluated ten patients for efficacy and ten for safety. The trial includes patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic SCCHN who have been treated with PD-1 blockade for at least 12 weeks with the best overall response being SD or unconfirmed progressive disease, or PD. Patients who achieved a PR, complete response, or CR, or confirmed progression on PD-1 blockade, are not eligible. Based on an initial assessment of the ten evaluable patients, SNS-301 in combination with pembrolizumab has been well tolerated and has shown promising anti-tumor activity, including a PR in one patient with a PD-L1 negative tumor who achieved SD as best overall response on PD-1 inhibition alone as well as SD in six patients. Of the six SD patients, one patient previously had PD on PD-L1 inhibition and two patients have achieved longstanding SD for greater than 36 weeks following treatment. We anticipate reporting a large additional subset of data from this trial by the end of 2021. If the results of this trial are positive, subject to feedback from the FDA, we intend to initiate a randomized, registration-enabling trial for SNS-301. 
 Based on the results we have observed to date, we have commenced enrollment of patients in an additional treatment arm of our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the addition of SNS-301 to pembrolizumab in PD-1 blockade naïve SCCHN patients. We intend to use an ImmunoPhage cocktail targeting the E6/E7 antigens of HPV, in combination with SNS-301, in HPV positive patients in our ongoing trial of SNS-301, which we expect to incorporate in 2021. In addition, we are currently planning a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SNS-301 in combination with durvalumab for patients with locally advanced resectable SCCHN in the neoadjuvant setting. We intend to initiate the first trial in patients with locally advanced resectable SCCHN in the neoadjuvant setting in 2021. 
 In addition to SNS-301, we are currently developing our next ImmunoPhage candidate, SNS-401, for the treatment of MCC. We plan on submitting an IND for SNS-401 in 2022. We are also developing a mAb therapy targeting VISTA. Through the use of proprietary functional and in vivo assays, we intend to select a product candidate and initiate IND-enabling studies for our lead mAb by the end of 2021.

Our Pipeline 
 We are utilizing our pioneering ImmunoPhage platform, which harnesses the intrinsic immunostimulatory characteristics and capabilities of bacteriophage, to develop a pipeline of product candidates with an initial focus on treatments for cancer. We have worldwide commercial rights for each of our product candidates. Our current portfolio of therapeutic initiatives is presented in the diagram below: 

Our Approach to Immunotherapy 
 Our ImmunoPhage Platform 
 We believe that the unique features of bacteriophage give it the potential to be used in the development of differentiated treatments for cancer. The pioneering work with bacteriophage documented in scientific literature describes its potential utility as a powerful, self-adjuvanted immunotherapy platform. However, we have not directly evaluated our ImmunoPhase platform in clinical trials beyond those described below. We selected bacteriophage because of its native immunostimulatory capabilities, large and tractable genome, and tolerability profile. The highly immunogenic nature of bacteriophage promotes a balanced, coordinated and robust response by both the innate and the cellular and humoral components of the adaptive immune system. Bacteriophage has the ability to generate both T cell responses and B cell mediated antibody responses. 
 The bacteriophage lambda, or lambda phage, is the foundation of our ImmunoPhage platform. Lambda phage is composed of an icosahedral head, or capsid, consisting of major capsid proteins gpD and gpE that surround a single copy of a 48.5 kb double-stranded DNA genome and a flexible tail structure. The gpD protein forms specialized structures on the capsid that results in over 400 copies of the protein being displayed on the capsid surface, which can be modified with antigens to increase the antigen presentation capacity of the phage. The lambda phage DNA genome contains abundant CpG sequence motifs, which are known to function as potent APC activators, through TLR9-mediated signaling. 
 As bacteriophages are ubiquitous, patients either have pre-existing anti-phage antibody titers or quickly develop anti-phage antibodies upon repeat dosing. However, rather than contributing to neutralization, as is experienced with many viral and protein-based therapies, the presence of phage antibodies may augment ImmunoPhage activity through a process known as antibody-dependent enhancement, or ADE. 
 In addition to its natural characteristics, lambda phage can be manufactured without significant difficulty and is amenable to further optimization through our proprietary engineering capabilities, such as the addition of antigens and integration of our proprietary nanobodies, which can be used to direct the phage to specific cells and as payloads that can be incorporated into our product candidates.

Structure of Lambda Phage 
 
Our ImmunoPhage platform capitalizes on the following key immunostimulatory features: 
  
• | Self-adjuvanted: ImmunoPhage elicits an enhanced immune response and displays a high-density of the protein sequence of the targeted antigen and contains multiple CpG motifs in its DNA genome, eliminating the need to include an exogenous adjuvant common to competing viral and mRNA nanoparticle immunotherapies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intrinsic APC targeting: ImmunoPhage demonstrates a natural tropism for APCs. We have identified and are advancing additional mechanisms, such as engineering moieties on ImmunoPhage targeted to proteins found on APCs, to further optimize APC targeting and costimulatory signaling. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modular antigen design: We intend to use off-the-shelf common antigens together with viral and patient-specific antigens as an array of customized, multi-antigen phage configurations, which we refer to as phage cocktails. We believe that the ability to dose cocktails of ImmunoPhage displaying different antigens have the potential to create a personalized, patient-specific immunotherapy. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeted use of nanobodies: We are developing nanobodies targeted to immune checkpoints and other immune stimulatory molecules that can be packaged into the phage as immunomodulatory payloads to enhance immunogenicity. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Structure of Our ImmunoPhage 
 

Our proprietary nanobodies, derived from alpacas, are antibody-like structures that consist of a single monomeric variable domain located on the heavy chain. Nanobodies are small (approximately 1/10 the size of mAb), robust protein-binding molecules that we believe represent the optimal class of molecules for use as immunomodulatory proteins, where payload space in a delivery vector or vehicle is limited. Like conventional antibodies, nanobodies can bind selectively to a specific antigen, but they possess additional advantages to conventional antibodies, including: 
  
• | Small size: Provides better access to binding grooves and contours on proteins on target cells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stability: Stable at a wide range of temperatures and able to refold properly at varying temperatures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 4

 
• | High Solubility: Hydrophilic, single-chain structure allows nanobodies to avoid aggregation issues common to mAbs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of manufacturing: Easier and less expensive to produce due to benefits from improved screening and isolation techniques and bacterial cell production. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Size of Conventional Human Antibody versus Camelid Nanobody
 
We maintain the ability to produce our customized nanobodies in-house that are compatible with our ImmunoPhage engineering processes. Our product candidates are able to be manufactured through the well-established principles of bacterial fermentation, which provides cost and scalability advantages. We can achieve GMP manufacture of an ImmunoPhage dose configuration in-house in as little as four weeks. We believe that these advantages, along with the long-term stability of ImmunoPhage, make personalized ImmunoPhage cocktails a commercially viable solution to the current challenges facing fully personalized patient-specific immunotherapy. 
 ImmunoPhage Mechanism of Action 
 Our mechanism of action focuses on what we believe to be the critical step leading to the generation of effective anti-tumor T cells, the immune priming step where APCs acquire and process tumors antigens, and interact with CD4 and CD8 T cells in the immune synapse. ImmunoPhage mimics a pathogenic virus and naturally targets APCs that capitalize on phage-intrinsic danger signals which activate these critical cells. The aggregation of antigen and danger signals enable self-adjuvant capabilities in a single entity which help to enhance the immunogenicity and augment downstream immune responses, including antigen-specific B and T cell responses. In order to drive optimal generation of antigen-specific T cells, the APC must deliver three discrete critical signals to the T cell, as shown below. 
 ImmunoPhage Activates Three Discrete Critical Signals Required to Drive Activation of T Cells 
 


 
Signal one involves antigenic peptides, derived from APC protein processing pathways, presented in the context of the appropriate major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, molecules, Class II for CD4 T cells and Class I for CD8 T cells. An alternate MHC Class I presentation pathway results in the activation of CD8 T cells through a process called cross presentation. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Signal two involves the APC expressing positive costimulatory molecules CD80 (or CD86) interacting with CD28 on the T cells. In the presence of significant negative costimulatory signals through molecules like PD-L1 or VISTA, or the lack of sufficient positive co-stimulation, the interaction between APC and T cell can lead to dysfunction of the T cell rather than T cell activation.

 5

 
Signal three collectively refers to the cytokine microenvironment of the immune synapse wherein the priming interaction between APC and T cell is occurring. This cytokine milieu determines the differentiation and fitness of the downstream T cell response. For instance, a rich IL-12 environment leads to a Th1 biased immune response and enhanced generation of CTLs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that ImmunoPhage can efficiently deliver antigen to and activate DCs, driving these three critical signals in the priming phase of the immune response. We have observed that increasing doses of ImmunoPhage on human skin-derived DC cultures increase the critical components of signals two and three in a dose-dependent fashion. Importantly, in the context of anti-tumor immune responses, which require the generation of tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells, phages can drive cross-presentation of displayed antigens, even breaking tolerance to “self” TAAs. 
 Since the development of pembrolizumab and other inhibitors of the PD-1 signaling pathway, it has become clear that a prerequisite for response to PD-1 blockade is the presence of a sufficient number of tumor-specific T cells, particularly, CD8 T cells in the TME. Patients with poorly immunogenic tumors lacking CD8 T cells represent a major unmet medical need. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for our ImmunoPhage platform to drive the generation of tumor antigen-specific T-cells and potentially convert PD-1 blockade non-responders into responders. 
 To optimize immunotherapy in cancer, a two-fold approach may be required: the first is the systemic generation of antigen-specific T cells through vaccination or adoptive transfer and the second refers to inhibition of immunosuppressive mechanisms limiting the entry of T cells into the TME. In situ vaccination has been shown to “soften” the TME and increase T cell infiltration. We believe that ImmunoPhage delivered to the tumor, either by direct intralesional injection or by the development of tumor-targeted phages, can deliver both a potent generation of tumor-specific T cells and enhancement of T cell infiltration into tumors. 
 In addition to our ImmunoPhage-based approach, we are developing a human mAb targeting the immunosuppressive VISTA checkpoint protein as well as nanobody programs targeting other key molecules preventing T cell entry into the TME and cytotoxic activity, including TGFb, IL-10 and PD-1. The goal of these programs is to limit the immunosuppressive mechanisms that prevent T cell entry into the TME. 
 ImmunoPhage leverages anti-drug antibodies that limit the use of other viral and protein-based therapies to enhance immunogenicity. ADE occurs when anti-phage antibodies which coat the capsid surface result in enhanced uptake by, and activation of, DCs through the binding and activation of Fc receptors, or FcRs. The high-density of phage-bound antibody is thought to lead to massive cross-linking of certain FcRs, leading to a strong immunogenic response to FcR-mediated endocytosis of the phage antigen/antibody complex. This mode of DC activation can lead to enhanced T cell responses, including CD8 priming by enabling cross-presentation. 
 

Our Adaptive Approach to ImmunoPhage Cocktail Therapy 
 Our ImmunoPhage platform enables a cocktail therapy approach that has the potential to provide patients with the benefits of both an off-the-shelf treatment and a personalized approach to their individual cancer. Each ImmunoPhage product candidate we produce has a unique therapeutic armament, such as various multivalent antigens, including those targeting CD4, CD8 and B cell epitopes designed to deliver broad epitope coverage, and nanobody payloads added to boost antigenicity or provide direct cancer cell killing capabilities. Based on the profile of a patient’s tumor, multiple distinct ImmunoPhage product candidates, each having a distinct profile, can be combined for treatment. We believe that broad epitope coverage along with nanobody payloads, combined with the intrinsic immunostimulatory activity of our ImmunoPhage product candidates, can provide patients a therapy with meaningful clinical benefits.

The modular nature of the Phortress library allows for personalized dynamic substitution of particular ImmunoPhage components to optimize patient therapy. Moreover, the ease of manufacturing allows us to perform immune monitoring in patients to assess the immunogenicity of each phage component of a cocktail and adjust the cocktail during the course of treatment. To date, we have constructed over 25 unique ImmunoPhage configurations and anticipate expanding our Phortress library as we advance our clinical stage programs. 
 We also intend to utilize the potential of an adaptive cocktail therapy approach in our ongoing and future clinical trials, including in our SNS-301 and SNS-401 programs. We have discussed the proposed clinical trial design, including the adaptive cocktail therapy approach, with the FDA. We believe this strategy will allow us to use insights derived from initial study cohorts, such as antibody titers raised against a target antigen, to dictate phage substitutions to the phage cocktail which are subsequently tested in additional cohorts. The best performing cocktail can then be advanced into dose expansion and later-stage clinical trials. 
 ImmunoPhage Adaptive Cocktail Therapy Approach
 

We believe that the speed of manufacturing and antigenic capacity of ImmunoPhage cocktails will allow us to address the limitations of neoantigen-only vaccine approaches. With the Phortress library, we have the ability to quickly initiate an off-the-shelf immunotherapy with a patient-specific ImmunoPhage cocktail from our shared antigen library within 1 to 2 weeks of diagnosis as display in steps 1 through 3 in the figure below, and then to augment the cocktail with a newly designed neoantigen phage within 4 to 6 weeks, as displayed in steps 4 through 6 below. We believe that this approach has the potential to address the urgency of treatment and provide the patient with an enhanced anti-tumor immune response.

Our Personalized Immunotherapy Process
 

SNS-301: Our Lead ImmunoPhage Candidate Targeting ASPH for Treatment of SCCHN
Our lead product candidate, SNS-301, is an ImmunoPhage construct engineered to generate a strong, specific immune response against the TAA ASPH. We believe the immune stimulatory effects generated by our ImmunoPhage platform, combined with the inhibition of the PD-1 immune system checkpoint, act in a complementary manner to produce an enhanced immune response in SCCHN patients. SNS-301 is being studied in an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial in combination with pembrolizumab. As of December 10, 2020, ten patients were evaluable for efficacy. Of these patients, we have observed that SNS-301 in combination with pembrolizumab has been well tolerated and has shown promising anti-tumor activity, including a PR in one patient with a PD-L1 negative tumor and disease control in seven of ten evaluable patients. 
Head and Neck Cancer 
 Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, accounting for approximately 6% of all cancer cases, and is responsible for an estimated 1% to 2% of all cancer deaths. Head and neck cancers encompass an array of cancers originating in the squamous cells that line the moist, mucosal surfaces inside the head and neck. More than 90% of head and neck cancers are classified as squamous cell carcinomas that raise from the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx. 
 An estimated 650,000 cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide, including approximately 50,000 cases in the United States, with more than 350,000 deaths annually worldwide. HPV infection accounts for an estimated 70% of SCCHN cases in the United States. The primary causes of SCCHN are smoking, heavy alcohol use and certain types of HPV. 
 Early-stage head and neck cancer is typically either treated with surgery or radiation alone; however, approximately 66% of patients present with advanced disease and fewer than 30% of these are cured. The management of advanced disease consists of multiple-modality therapy with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Despite improvements in diagnoses and local management, long-term survival rates for patients with SCCHN have not increased significantly over the past 30 years and are among the lowest when compared against other major cancers. 
 Targeting ASPH 
 ASPH is a TAA, strongly expressed in 70% to 90% of human malignancies, including carcinomas, such as SCCHN, and sarcomas and hematologic malignancies. Expression of ASPH is related to cancer cell growth, invasiveness, and disease progression 
 8

through the Notch signaling pathway. SNS-301 is designed to overcome self-tolerance and induce robust and durable humoral and cellular immune responses that target tumors expressing ASPH. 
 In the course of conducting our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial for SNS-301, we collected ASPH-positive tumor samples from 30 patients who had been screened for inclusion in our trial, although some patients who had samples collected did not satisfy other criteria for ultimate inclusion in our trial. The samples were stained to show intratumoral ASPH expression. Depicted below is a staining of a representative patient’s tumor biopsy using an immunohistochemistry assay. The first figure shows the magnification at low power, while the second figure shows the same sample at a higher power of magnification. In each figure, the ASPH is shown in the darker color. 
 Representative Patient ASPH-Positive Tumor Sample 
 
SNS-301—A Potential Solution for SCCHN 
 We believe that SNS-301, in combination with pembrolizumab, has the potential to produce enhanced activity in patients with SCCHN compared to currently available therapies. We are developing SNS-301 for the treatment of SCCHN due to the cancer’s lack of intratumoral T cells and the consequent modest objective response rate to PD-1 blockade. We selected SCCHN as our first indication based on a high unmet need, a clearly defined regulatory path and easily accessible tumor for obtaining biopsies for early translational data to evaluate immune activation. 
 Although drugs utilizing PD-1 blockade have been approved for several years in the treatment of advanced SCCHN after platinum containing chemotherapy, the objective response rate, or ORR, has been reported to be as modest as 13% to 18% in relapsed or refractory SCCHN patients with progression free survival, or PFS, of two months and overall survival, or OS, of eight months. Objective responses predominantly occur in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, with demonstrated ORR of 21% for PD-L1 positive patients, while patients with PD-L1 negative tumors are reported to have a response rate of only 6%. Pembrolizumab has been approved for use as a first-line therapy in combination with chemotherapy for all patients and as a single agent for patients with PD-L1 positive of T cells infiltrating the tumor. As SCCHN tumors are often lacking intratumoral CD8 T cells, we believe that the addition of SNS-301 has the potential to generate and expand ASPH specific anti-tumor T cells and thereby enhance PD-1 blockade activity. 
 SNS-301: Ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial Status and Design 
 We are currently conducting an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SNS-301 in combination with pembrolizumab. The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the safety and tolerability of SNS-301 in combination with pembrolizumab and the anti-tumor activity of the combination treatment as measured by ORR, PFS per iRECIST and OS. The secondary objective is to assess the preliminary immune response, which is measured by evaluating antigen-specific antibody and T cells and other lymphocytes. Examination of paired pre- and post-treatment biopsy samples are being utilized to evaluate whether the addition of SNS-301 to PD-1 blockade results in increased inflammation, determined by the presence of TILs, PD-L1, inflammatory gene signatures. As of March 9, 2021 we have enrolled 17 patients in the trial.  As of December 10, 2020, we have evaluated ten patients for efficacy and ten for safety. Our Phase 1/2 trial includes patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic SCCHN who have been treated with PD-1 blockade for at least 12 weeks with the best overall response being SD or unconfirmed PD based on 
 9

RECIST1.1 and iRECIST, industry accepted standard guidelines for tumor evaluation. RECIST 1.1 defines a CR, PR, SD and PD as follows: 
 
 
Category | Description 
-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------
Complete Response (CR) | Disappearance of all Tumor Lesions 
Partial Response (PR) | Reduction of ≥30% of the Sum of Target Diameters 
Stable Disease (SD) | Reduction of <30% or increase of <20% of the Sum of Target Diameters
Progressive Disease (PD) | Increase of ≥20% of the Sum of Target Diameters 

 Patients who achieved a PR, CR or confirmed progression on PD-1 blockade are not eligible for participation in this clinical trial. The rationale for this restrictive inclusion criteria is based on reported data demonstrating that the median time to a PR or CR with PD-1 blockade is two months. Therefore, by excluding patients that achieved PRs or CRs while on PD-1 blockade alone for at least 12 weeks, we believe that any PRs or CRs observed in our Phase 1/2 trial are likely attributable to the addition of SNS-301. Similarly, we believe that a patient with PD on single-agent PD-1 blockade achieving stabilization after the addition of SNS-301 is an indication of clinical benefit from the treatment combination. 
 Phase 1/2 trial design 
 The treatment regimen consists of repeat doses of SNS-301 administered intradermally on Day 0, Week 3, Week 6, Week 9, then every 6 weeks for 6 additional doses, and thereafter every 12 weeks until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient intolerability as determined by the investigator or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression. Pembrolizumab is administered intravenously as per standard of care at either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 6 weeks. 
 Design of the Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of SNS-301 in SCCHN
 
The Phase 1/2 trial consists of a safety run-in followed by a Simon two-stage design in the absence of any dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, during the safety run-in, with a total initial enrollment of 15 patients, which we refer to as Stage 1. The trial design allows additional expansion up to a total of 30 patients if one CR or PR is observed in Stage 1. We did not observe any DLTs during the safety run-in and are continuing to enroll patients through Stage 1. Since one patient in our clinical trial has already achieved a confirmed PR, as described below, the pre-defined efficacy criteria of Stage 1 has been met, allowing us to continue into Stage 2 and dose up to a total of 30 patients in the trial. 
 Ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial Results 
 Preliminary evidence of clinical benefit of SNS-301 in combination with pembrolizumab 
 As of the December 10, 2020 data cutoff for the first 11 patients in Stage 1 of our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, we observed the following results in the first ten patients evaluable for efficacy: 

• | PR in one patient with a PD-L1 negative tumor who previously achieved SD on PD-1 inhibition alone;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SD in six patients, including:
--+-------------------------------


o | one patient that has achieved SD for more than 4 months following PD at enrollment after 10 months of PD-L1 blockade treatment; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | two patients with longstanding SD for 9 and 9.5 months, respectively, of which one SD occurred in a patient with a PD-L1 negative tumor; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PD in three patients, including two patients who had PD at enrollment while on PD-1 blockade.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 One patient withdrew consent prior to the first efficacy evaluation and was therefore not evaluable for efficacy. As shown in the figure below, disease control, as evidenced by PR or SD, was achieved in seven of the ten patients regardless of HPV status. Tumor regression was observed regardless of PD-L1 or HPV status. 
 Duration of Response in Ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial of SNS-301 in Combination with Pembrolizumab
 
Patient G referred to in the chart above achieved a PR at 12 weeks. This patient was diagnosed in May 2018 with HPV negative and PD-L1 negative SCCHN. At diagnosis, the cancer was classified as Stage II and graded T2N0M0, an enlarged tumor (<4 cm) that had not spread to lymph nodes or other organs. This patient received radiation therapy followed by two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, achieving a PR. At the time of enrollment into this trial, the patient had received pembrolizumab for more than 12 weeks with SD. After six weeks on SNS-301 in combination with pembrolizumab, the combined lesion measurement had decreased by 29%. After 12 weeks, the combined lesion measurement had decreased by 43% from baseline, achieving a PR that was confirmed at the 18-week scans. Furthermore, the 30 week scan showed an additional decrease to 52%, maintaining a PR. 
 Patient C is another patient of notable clinical interest who had been treated with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab for 10 months when scans showed PD per RECIST 1.1. After receiving combination therapy with SNS-301 and pembrolizumab, two consecutive scans six weeks apart showed SD. Given that SCCHN is an aggressive disease, we believe stabilization of an ongoing progression suggests that SNS-301 likely added to the improvement of the patient’s disease status. Safety concerns related to COVID-19 prevented the acquisition of paired biopsies to evaluate the TME in this patient. 
 In addition, of the two Patients (A and B) with longstanding SD of 9 and 9.5 months, respectively, Patient A’s tumor was assessed as PD-L1 negative in the clinical setting. 
 Translational Data Demonstrated T Cell Integration into the Tumor Supporting Antitumor Activity of SNS-301 
 A comparison of pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies showed a definitive increase in PD-L1 expression, which likely represents an influx of T cells into the TME and aligns with the achieved clinical benefit. As illustrated below, a predominance of tumor cells was observed pre-treatment, with a pronounced influx of immune cells noted upon treatment. Multiplex IHC demonstrates that the PD-L1 staining in the post-treatment biopsy is found in close proximity to PD-1 positive CD4 and CD8 TILs.

SNS-301 Catalyzes Conversion of PD-L1NEG Immune Desert Tumor into Inflamed Phenotype in Patient with PR
 
Given that the patient initially had a PD-L1 negative tumor with no objective response to PD-1 blockade alone and that after combination treatment the patient achieved a PR with transformation of the tumor into a PD-L1 positive inflamed phenotype, we believe the additional treatment benefit is likely attributable to the addition of SNS-301. Serology data indicated the presence of anti-phage antibodies prior to treatment, suggesting increased immunogenic activity related to ADE. 
 SNS-301 in Combination with Pembrolizumab has been well tolerated 
 As of December 10, 2020, based on the 11 patients enrolled in our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, the combination of SNS-301 and pembrolizumab has been generally well tolerated. No DLTs have been observed in the safety run-in and observed adverse events, or AEs, have primarily been either Grade 1 or 2 or unrelated to treatment. Three Grade 3 related AEs, dehydration, electrocardiogram QT prolongation and rash, have been reported. Four serious adverse events, or SAEs, have been reported. The Grade 3 dehydration was also an SAE as a result of hospitalization; however, it was attributed to an underlying cancer and concomitant medication by the sponsor, and therefore not a reportable event. One patient experienced an SAE for Grade 2 hemoptysis and two weeks later a second SAE of Grade 2 dehydration. Neither of these events were considered related to study drug, but were instead attributed to disease progression
. There was one SAE of Grade 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome that occurred during the follow-up visit but was assessed as not being a treatment-related adverse event. 
 SNS-301: Future Clinical Plans 
 We expect to report a large subset of data from the Phase 1/2 trial by the end of 2021. If the results from our Phase 1/2 trial are positive, subject to feedback from the FDA, we intend to initiate a randomized, registration-enabling trial of SNS-301 against standard of care, single-agent pembrolizumab. 
 Based on the results we have observed to date, we have commenced enrollment of patients in an additional treatment arm of our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the addition of SNS-301 to pembrolizumab in PD-1 blockade naïve SCCHN patients.
 We also intend to use an ImmunoPhage cocktail targeting the E6/E7 antigens of HPV, in combination with SNS-301, in HPV positive patients in our ongoing trial of SNS-301, which we expect to incorporate in 2021. As a significant percentage of SCCHN patients are HPV positive, we believe the opportunity to incorporate our HPV-specific E6/E7 ImmunoPhage into a combination with SNS-301 has the potential to increase the evidence of clinical benefit seen to date. 
 We entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AstraZeneca in May 2019 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of AstraZeneca’s PD-1 inhibitor, durvalumab, in combination with SNS-301. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca will be supplying us with durvalumab for the trial with no upfront, milestone or royalty payments required by us. We intend to initiate a first trial under this collaboration in patients with locally advanced resectable SCCHN in the neoadjuvant setting in 2021. 
 Prior Clinical Results 
 In 2018, we completed a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of SNS-301 in patients with biochemical relapse of localized prostate cancer after surgery or radiotherapy. SNS-301 was dosed intradermally in three cohorts of patients, using a fixed dose escalation scheme every 21 days to establish the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD. Patients who tested positive for ASPH in either tumor tissue or serum were eligible to continue in the study. The treatment regimen consisted of three repeat doses of SNS-301 at each dose level (2.0 x 1010, 1.0 x 1011 and 3.0 x 1011 particles) administered intradermally every 21 days 
 12

for nine cycles plus six months of follow up. Three patients were enrolled in the low and mid dose cohorts and six patients were enrolled in the high dose cohort. 
 SNS-301 was well tolerated in the trial, with few and mostly mild AEs, no observed DLTs and no patients experiencing study drug related SAEs or Grade 4 or Grade 5 AEs. Importantly, there were no indications of an off-target autoimmune response. Furthermore, the MTD of SNS-301 was not reached. Three major protocol deviations occurred during the study: two patients went from middle to high dose prematurely of which one stayed at the higher dose level and one patient varied between middle and high dose levels in subsequent cycles, and one patient (assigned to the lowest dose level) was started on the excluded anti-androgen drug bicalutamide after one year on study treatment. Of the 12 treated subjects, nine discontinued the study before completing all protocol required assessments: six because of sponsor decision, one due to investigator decision, and one with prostate-specific antigen doubling time <90 days and one from an AE (severe arthralgia not related to study drug). 
 All patients had antigen-specific immune responses, with SNS-301 inducing a multi-variate immune response including T cells and B cells in the majority of patients. In addition, seven of the 12 participants in this Phase 1 safety trial, or 58%, demonstrated a reduction in the doubling time of biomarker prostate specific antigen, or PSA, levels through cycle 2. The second dosage level of 1.0 x 1011 was chosen as the recommended Phase 2 dose based on safety, immunogenicity data and the observation of an improvement in PSA doubling time for the mid-dose patients (two of three patients) compared to the high dose (three of six patients).
 Preclinical Study Results 
 SNS-301 was evaluated in rodents for immunogenicity and efficacy. Immunogenicity was observed in mice and rats, with both humoral and cellular immune response specific to ASPH to the amount of and number of doses. Efficacy data was obtained in three rodent tumor models, BNLT3, 4T1 and MLLB-2, showing inhibition of tumor and or metastasis growth. A repeat dose toxicology study in rats has been conducted with no adverse safety findings for SNS-301. 
 As illustrated in the graph below, in a murine model of hepatocellular carcinoma, co-administration of SNS-301 and a PD-1 inhibitor resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth, as did administration of SNS-301 or an anti-PD-1 antibody individually. We believe the results of this study provide encouraging evidence that checkpoint inhibition removes immunological encumbrances while at the same time SNS-301 works to drive antigen-specific immune activation. 
 SNS-301 and PD-1 Blockade Slowed Tumor Growth in a Liver Cancer (Hepa 1-6) Treatment Model
 
SNS-401: Our ImmunoPhage Candidate Targeting Merkel Cell Carcinoma 
 We are currently developing our next ImmunoPhage candidate, SNS-401, for the treatment of MCC. MCC is a rare but highly aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin in which MCPyV infection and chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation are key risk factors. Approximately 2,500 cases are diagnosed each year with the disease-specific mortality approaching 50%. Integration of MCPyV is evidenced by the presence of virus-specific epitopes in 80% of cases diagnosed in the U.S. In these cases, expression of a virus-related T cell oncogenic antigen appears intimately linked to tumor growth. 
 Checkpoint inhibitors have proven to be a major advancement in the treatment of advanced MCC and have revolutionized the treatment of locally advanced, inoperable and metastatic MCC. Systemic PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition therapy is associated with a high ORR, prolonged durable responses, and good tolerability in advanced-stage MCC. However, even with the advances made by checkpoint inhibitors, refractory PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor disease remains a significant unmet medical need with an aggressive clinical course. 
 13

In March 2020, we established an exclusive exploratory collaboration with The University of Washington, one of the world’s leading research centers for the study of MCC. This collaboration provides for the joint construction, to the preclinical development stage, of the first custom MCC vaccine consisting of MCPyV epitopes together with other patient specific antigens. There are no upfront, milestone or royalty payments payable to either party as part of this collaboration. The University of Washington will design MCPyV T cell constructs and determine the immunogenicity and mechanism of candidate ImmunoPhages developed by us. We will develop ImmunoPhages specifically targeting MCPyV T cell constructs and other TAAs using our cocktail approach. We believe that the MCPyV epitope space can be completely addressed with an ImmunoPhage cocktail of two bacteriophage carriers. We have an option to license on an exclusive, worldwide basis the intellectual property developed as part of this collaboration. Currently, we plan on submitting an IND for SNS-401 in 2022. 
 SNS-VISTA: Monoclonal Antibody targeting VISTA 
 We are developing a mAb therapy targeting VISTA. VISTA is an immunoregulatory receptor and is highly expressed on various immune system cells including neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, basophils and DCs. While highly expressed on CD4 T helper cells and certain T regulatory cells, it exhibits much lower expression on CD8 CTLs. 
 VISTA is an important checkpoint regulator. Effective PD-1 blockade is often confounded by alternative immune checkpoints, such as VISTA, and we have chosen to develop a mAb targeting VISTA in the expectation that our development of this checkpoint inhibitor will closely complement our ImmunoPhage development activities. Unlike other checkpoint regulators, which are induced after activation, VISTA expression is maintained at a steady state. This broad pattern of expression suggests that VISTA has an important role in regulating immune system activity and preserving homeostasis. VISTA’s presence in tumors is often indicative of a poor prognosis. Analysis of the TME often reveals an absence of TILs as well as a reduction in cytokines and other co-stimulatory molecules. VISTA blockade appears to dramatically modulate the TME towards a state that favors an immune system response, resulting in improved T-cell effector function and anti-tumor activity. Accordingly, VISTA has been identified as a promising therapeutic target. 
 In January 2020, we entered into a collaborative agreement with AdiMab to expedite antibody development through the production of human IgGs that we may evaluate as potential therapeutic product candidates. Under this agreement, we provide key proprietary reagents and information to AdiMab to enable the initiation of antibody discovery and development. In March 2020, AdiMab initiated our VISTA antibody campaign. In June 2020, we received a first shipment of 84 IgGs for further screening. Among these, several have passed through our proprietary screening criteria and we believe multiple antibodies possess the desired biophysical properties and mechanism of action for a potential clinical candidate. Through the use of proprietary functional and in vivo assays, we intend to select a product candidate and initiate IND-enabling studies for our lead mAb by the end of 2021. 
 Manufacturing 
 We have manufactured SNS-301 bulk drug substance for clinical trials, as well as our current Phortess library, at our own manufacturing facility. We are in the process of establishing a new manufacturing facility, which will further enable production of drug substance under cGMP conditions. We believe that having control over the manufacturing process allows us to reduce cycle times, increase the robustness and consistency of the process and potentially reduce cost of goods for commercial production, which are critical to the construction of our Phortress library consisting of multiple novel ImmunoPhage. We expect that having a dedicated manufacturing facility will allow us to optimize commercial-scale processes and to develop a suitable workforce capable of supporting market launch. As we advance into later-stage clinical trials and additional indications, we intend to expand our current manufacturing capabilities to support larger scale clinical trials and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. 
 We may also rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our product candidates for clinical use. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with cGMP, and all other applicable laws and regulations. Although we have established our own manufacturing facility, we may rely on CMOs for parts of the process, like filling and labelling of our products for commercial sale. Any agreements with potential and existing manufacturers will include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through inclusion in expedited development and review, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. 
 14

We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for our clinical product SNS-301. The claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 9,744,223 and 10,702,591 encompass the clinical product. We continue to pursue claims directed to the clinical product in related applications. Such applications may not result in issued patents and, even if patents do issue, such patents may not be in a form that will provide us with meaningful protection for our product. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. Trade secrets are difficult to protect and provide us with only limited protection. 
 We expect to file additional patent applications in support of current and new clinical candidates as well as new platform and core technologies. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any issued patents we may obtain in any jurisdiction where such patent term extensions are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
 In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage. 
 We file U.S. non-provisional applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Office. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing. 
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We seek to file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to pursue maximum coverage and value for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs. 
 15

We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Third-party patents could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 When available to expand market exclusivity, our strategy is to obtain, or license additional intellectual property related to current or contemplated development platforms, core elements of technology and/or clinical candidates. 
 As of March 9, 2021, our solely owned patent estate included four issued U.S. patents, two issued foreign patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, two pending international (PCT) patent applications, and over eight foreign patent applications (pending in Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan). 
 With regard to SNS-301, we own one pending U.S. patent application and two issued U.S. patents with composition of matter claims covering SNS-301. The issued U.S. patents and U.S. patent application, if issued, are expected to expire in 2033, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges. We also own one issued European EP patent (in force in France, Germany and the United Kingdom) and five pending foreign patent applications (pending in Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan), where the EP European patent and the pending foreign patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2034. 
 We own one pending U.S. patent application and one pending, published PCT application with claims directed to methods for using and making the SNS-301 product candidate. The U.S. patent application and patent applications claiming the benefit of the PCT application, if issued, are expected to expire in 2039, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges.  
 We own one pending U.S. patent application and one pending, published PCT application relating to methods for using the SNS-301 product candidate in combination with immune checkpoint protein inhibitors. The U.S. patent application and patent applications claiming the benefit of the PCT application, if issued, are expected to expire in 2040, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges. 
 We own one provisional U.S. patent application relating to phage-based vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, and assuming either U.S. non-provisional or foreign patent applications are filed at the appropriate time, if issued, are projected to expire in 2041.

We own one provisional U.S. patent application relating to phage-based vaccines targeting human papilloma virus proteins. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, and assuming either U.S. non-provisional or foreign patent applications are filed at the appropriate time, if issued, are projected to expire in 2042.
 We own one provisional U.S. patent application relating to decorated phage-based vaccines and cocktails of such vaccines. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, and assuming either U.S. non-provisional or foreign patent applications are filed at the appropriate time, if issued, are projected to expire in 2042.
 License Agreement with Fred Hutch 
 In connection with our acquisition of Alvaxa Biosciences, Inc., or Alvaxa, in May 2020, we acquired a non-exclusive license agreement, or the Fred Hutch Agreement, with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, or Fred Hutch, which was originally entered into in January 2020 and amended in March 2020. Pursuant to the Fred Hutch Agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to possess, maintain, and use certain biological materials, including llama-derived antibodies, for any and all uses. Under the Fred Hutch Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing or derived from an antibody in any form, or a developed product. 
 As partial consideration for the licensed rights granted under the Fred Hutch Agreement, Alvaxa issued Fred Hutch 1,429,412 shares of its common stock, which were subsequently exchanged for 45,656 shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of Alvaxa. Under the Fred Hutch Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee ranging from the mid-single digit thousands to approximately $0.1 million, depending on net sales of developed products in a given calendar year. We are also obligated to pay up to $300,000 in development milestone payments for each therapeutic developed product and up to $165,000 for each diagnostic developed product, in each case including each unique target covered by such developed product. We have no obligation to pay royalties under the Fred Hutch Agreement. 
 The Fred Hutch Agreement expires 20 years after the effective date. We may terminate the agreement for convenience, and Fred Hutch may terminate the agreement for our insolvency. Either party may terminate the agreement for breach of material obligations by such other party. 
 Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Know-How 
 Our trademark portfolio currently consists of two registered trademarks and one trademark application. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and employees. These and other agreements, such as invention assignment agreements, grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have made substantial investments in recent years into the rapid development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of a range of pathologies, including cancers and infectious diseases, making this a highly competitive market. 
 We face substantial competition from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed, or on the level of development of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to (i) obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or (ii) combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge within the field of immunotherapy and, furthermore, within the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases. 
 In addition to the current standard of care treatments for patients with cancers and infectious diseases, numerous commercial and academic preclinical studies and clinical trials are being undertaken by a large number of parties to assess novel technologies and product candidates in the field of immunotherapy. Results from these studies and trials have fueled increasing levels of interest in the field of immunotherapy. 
 Large pharmaceutical companies that have commercialized or are developing immunotherapies to treat cancer include AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and Roche/Genentech. 
 17

On the technology level, other companies which can potentially develop competing product candidates which act to stimulate the body’s immune response as a treatment for SCCHN and other solid tumors include companies developing cell-based therapeutics such as CAR-T/TCR/NK therapies as well as companies developing therapeutic vaccines including BioNTech, Moderna, Gritstone Oncology and Oncorus, among others. In addition, a number of companies are developing oncolytic virus approaches, including Boehringer Ingelheim, Johnson and Johnson, Regeneron, Vyriad, Replimune and Turnstone. Amgen has received FDA approval for its oncolytic virus-based product, T-VEC. Ablynx, a subsidiary of Sanofi, and Oncorus are actively pursuing the development of nanobodies as therapeutics. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or in combination with their respective strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sector is likely to result in greater resource concentration among a smaller number of our competitors. 
 Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through sizeable collaborative arrangements with established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retain qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, better tolerated, or of greater convenience or economic benefit than our proposed product offering. Our competitors also may be in a position to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly, resulting in a stronger or dominant market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be product safety, efficacy, convenience and treatment cost. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
U.S. Biological Product Development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of a license, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. 
 Our product candidates and any future biological product candidates we develop must be approved by the FDA through a biologics license application, or BLA, before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity and potency. The FDA review and approval process generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical studies conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLP, requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and IND 
 Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product biological characteristics, chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. 
 An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical Trials 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap or be combined, such that the objectives of multiple phases are addressed within the design of a single trial. 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate. When conducted in disease-affected patients and including an endpoint of early activity or efficacy, such a trial may be a Phase 1/2 trial, comprising a Phase 1 portion and a Phase 2 portion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19

 
adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2/3 trials may also be designed to sequentially address both dose finding and effectiveness in a single trial.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

 In August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology biological product development (i.e., the Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to biological product development and reduce developmental costs and time. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of licensure for biological products. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. 
 FDA Review Process 
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The BLA may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product candidate’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 20

The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA decides whether to accept a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The complete response letter may require additional clinical data, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) as well as other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation for a biologic must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user fee waivers. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same biological product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a biological product designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biological product candidate can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. 
 21

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. 
 A product candidate may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a biological product candidate shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such biologic. 
 Additionally, a biological product candidate may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. 
 Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the registration-enabling trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials as well as other clinical development programs. 
 Post-Marketing Requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the 
 22

commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violations, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of post-approval problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall. 
 U.S. Healthcare Reform and Other U.S. Healthcare Laws 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In addition, transparency laws and patient privacy regulations by federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions can apply to the manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of pharmaceutical manufactures. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that can affect a pharmaceutical company’s operations include: 
  
• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement, including providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label, material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of items or services reimbursable, whole or in part, by a federal or state governmental program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or 
 23

under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it; 
  
• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their subcontractors that use, disclose or otherwise process individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, covered manufacturers will be required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations with respect to certain laws. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect our business in an adverse way. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 24

Ensuring our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business. 
 It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Additionally, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal FCA as well as under the false claims laws of several states against a pharmaceutical manufacturer. The approval and commercialization of a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject it to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. Lastly, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business. 
 In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now, as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective January 1, 2019, agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs. 
 There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, there have been a number of significant changes to the ACA and its implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is uncertain when a decision will be reached or how the Supreme Court will rule. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020, along with other COVID-19 relief legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.

Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures. 
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that sought to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. Further, in November 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. 
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
 We expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and result in reduced demand for our current product candidates and any future product candidates or additional pricing pressures. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Legislative and regulatory proposals, and enactment of laws, at the foreign, federal and state levels, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, will continue into the future. Further, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of healthcare reform initiatives that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, particularly as a result of the recent presidential election. 
 U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates and any future product candidates we develop, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life 
 26

beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 as part of the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 U.S. regulation of companion diagnostics 
 Our product candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA approval. 
 If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our product candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biologic candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a biologic product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products. 
 The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in 
 27

vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of therapeutic candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee. 
 PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. In addition, as part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or a not-approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. 
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue an order denying approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable order. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 European Union Drug Development 
 In the European Union, or EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the member state where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical.

European Union Drug Review and Approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations. 

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other member states through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member state through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member state in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other member state, referred to as the Member States Concerned, for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the member states (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). 
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for MA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 European Union Drug Marketing 
 Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union member states, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. 
 Payments made to physicians in certain EU member states must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization as well as the regulatory authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. 
 29

European Data Collection 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Rest of the World Regulation 
 For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, when and if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, coverage determination is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of biosimilars for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a 
 30

pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and reimbursement. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and biologics is a time-consuming and costly process, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Assuming coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of prescribed products. 
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
