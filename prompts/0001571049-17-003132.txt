  ITEM 1.   BUSINESS.
 Unless the context otherwise requires, “G-III”, “us”, “we” and “our” refer to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. References to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on January 31 of that year. For example, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 is referred to as “fiscal 2017.” 
 All share and per share data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our two-for-one stock split effected on May 1, 2015. 
 Overview 
 G-III designs, manufactures and markets an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear, as well as women’s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. We sell our products under our own proprietary brands, which include DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Weejuns, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J and Jessica Howard, as well as under licensed brands and private retail labels. 
 We sell products under an extensive portfolio of well-known licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Docker’s, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan and Guess?. In our team sports business, we have licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Hands High, Touch by Alyssa Milano and over 140 U.S. colleges and universities. 
 Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Macy’s, TJX Companies, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue divisions, Ross Stores, Dillard’s, Burlington Coat Factory, the Bon-Ton Stores, Nordstrom and JC Penney. 
 We also distribute apparel and other products through our own retail stores. Substantially all of our DKNY, Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores are operated as outlet stores. As of January 31, 2017, we operated 190 Wilsons Leather stores, 163 G.H. Bass stores, 50 DKNY stores, 5 Calvin Klein Performance stores and 3 Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores, of which 403 were located in the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico and 8 are located internationally. Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY each operate their own on-line store. In addition, as of January 31, 2017, Vilebrequin products were distributed through 88 company-operated stores, as well as through 58 franchised locations and an e-commerce store in both Europe and the United States.
 Recent Acquisitions 
 We have acquired businesses that have broadened our product offerings, expanded our ability to serve different tiers of distribution and added a retail component to our business. Our acquisitions are part of our strategy to expand our product offerings and increase the portfolio of proprietary and licensed brands that we offer through different tiers of retail distribution. 
 In December 2016, we acquired Donna Karan International, Inc. from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. We believe that Donna Karan owns some of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan and DKNY Jeans. The acquisition of Donna Karan fits squarely into our strategy to diversify and expand our business. We intend to focus on the expansion of the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing DKNY Jeans, Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe that we can also capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry. We believe that our strong track record of driving organic growth, identifying and integrating acquisitions and developing talent throughout the organization makes the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands especially appealing. 
 In March 2017, we entered into an agreement with Macy’s under which Macy’s will serve, beginning February 2018, as the exclusive U.S. department store for sales of DKNY women’s apparel and accessories. Under the agreement, Macy’s will have the exclusive rights to sell DKNY women’s apparel, including women’s sportswear, dresses, suit separates, sport, denim, swim and outerwear, as well as, handbags and women’s shoes in all Macy’s locations and Macys.com. The agreement also plans for increased and enhanced DKNY shop-in-shops in many Macy’s stores. G-III and Macy’s are committed to making DKNY the premier fashion and lifestyle brand. We also intend to re-launch Donna Karan as an

  aspirational luxury brand that will be priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores nationwide. We will continue to operate the freestanding global DKNY stores and DKNY.com. We also will maintain DKNY’s agreements with international license partners and distributors outside of the United States. Products outside the exclusive categories and products distributed by DKNY’s various licensees under other categories in the DKNY family will continue to be sold to department stores, including Macy’s.
 In February 2016, we acquired a 19% minority interest in the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. This investment is intended to expand the partnership between us and the Karl Lagerfeld brand and extend their business development opportunities on a global scale. In June 2015, we acquired a 49% interest in a joint venture that holds brand rights to the Karl Lagerfeld trademarks for consumer products (with certain exceptions) and apparel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We are also the first licensee of the joint venture, having been granted a license for women’s apparel, women’s handbags, women’s shoes and men’s outerwear. We began shipping Karl Lagerfeld sportswear, dresses, women’s outerwear and handbags in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Karl Lagerfeld women’s footwear in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and Karl Lagerfeld women’s suits in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 Licensed Products 
 The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products over the past 20 years. 
 In July 2016, we signed a three-year extension through March 2020 of our license agreement with the National Football League. This agreement includes men’s and women’s outerwear, Starter men’s and women’s outerwear, men’s and women’s lifestyle apparel, Hands High men’s and women’s lifestyle apparel, and Touch by Alyssa Milano women’s lifestyle apparel. 
 In February 2016, we expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger through a new license agreement for Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the United States and Canada. This license for women’s sportswear, suit separates, performance and denim is in addition to existing Tommy Hilfiger licenses for dresses, men’s and women’s outerwear and luggage. The new license agreement has an initial term of five years and a renewal term of four years. Macy’s will continue to be the principal retailer of Tommy Hilfiger in the United States and women’s sportswear will continue to be a Macy’s exclusive offering. We believe Tommy Hilfiger is a classic American lifestyle brand. We intend to leverage our market expertise to help build sales of Tommy Hilfiger women’s apparel. We sell Tommy Hilfiger dresses, women’s suit separates, women’s performance wear, jeans and luggage. Women’s performance wear and women’s suits began shipping during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 In October 2015, we announced the launch of Hands High, a new licensed sports apparel line inspired by Tonight Show host, Jimmy Fallon. Hands High features professional team logos from the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. Hands High product was launched in October 2015 at retailers throughout the country, as well as at official team and stadium shops and official league websites. We started to ship Hands High products to over 40 universities in July 2016. 
 We believe that consumers prefer to buy brands they know, and we have continually sought licenses that would increase the portfolio of name brands we can offer through different tiers of retail distribution, for a wide array of products at a variety of price points. We believe that brand owners will look to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and they will seek licensees with a successful track record of expanding brands into new categories. It is our objective to continue to expand our product offerings and we are continually discussing new licensing opportunities with brand owners. 
 Licensing 
 As we have increased our portfolio of proprietary brands, we have licensed these brands in categories outside our core competencies. We began licensing Vilebrequin and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands in 2012 and 2013. Our licensing program will significantly increase as a result of owning the Donna Karan and DKNY brands.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The DKNY brand is currently licensed for a broad array of products including fragrance, watches, hosiery, intimates, eyewear, children’s clothing and home furnishings. We intend to focus on the expansion of licensing opportunities for the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing DKNY Jeans, Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry.
 G.H. Bass is licensed for the wholesale distribution of men’s and women’s footwear, men’s sportswear, men’s and boy’s tailored clothing, men’s socks, men’s accessories and women’s hosiery. 
 Vilebrequin has recently entered into licenses for watches and sunglasses. Both of these new lines are expected to commence distribution in 2017. 
 Segments 
 Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we began reporting based on two segments: wholesale operations and retail operations. The wholesale operations segment consists of our former licensed products and non-licensed products segments and includes sales of products under brands licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our own brands and private label brands. Wholesale sales and revenues from license agreements related to the Donna Karan International (“DKI”) business are included in the wholesale operations segment. The retail operations segment consists of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY stores, as well as a limited number of Calvin Klein Performance and Karl Lagerfeld Paris stores. See Note K to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information with respect to these segments. 
 G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 1989. We and our predecessors have conducted our business since 1974. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that our broad portfolio of high-profile brands combined with our extensive distribution relationships position us for growth. We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths in order to expand our position as an all-season diversified apparel company: 
 Broad portfolio of recognized brands.   We have built a broad and deep portfolio of over 40 licensed and proprietary brands. We believe we are a licensee of choice for well-known brands, as demonstrated by our partnerships with such brands as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Dockers, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan and Guess?, that have built a loyal following of both fashion-conscious consumers and retailers who desire high quality, well designed products. We have selectively added the licensing rights to premier brands in women’s, men’s and team sports categories catering to a wide range of customers. In addition to our licensed brands, we own a number of successful proprietary brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Weejuns, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J and Jessica Howard. In an environment of rapidly changing consumer fashion trends, we benefit from a balanced mix of well-established and newer brands. Our experience in developing and acquiring licensed brands and proprietary labels, as well as our reputation for producing high quality, well-designed apparel, has led major department stores and retailers to select us as a designer and manufacturer for their private label programs.

 Diversified distribution base.   We market our products at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers. Our products are sold to approximately 2,400 customers, including a cross section of retailers such as Macy’s, TJX Companies, Hudson’s Bay Company, including their Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue divisions, Ross Stores, Dillard’s, Burlington Coat Factory, the Bon-Ton Stores, Nordstrom and JC Penney, as well as membership clubs such as Costco and Sam’s Club and e-commerce retailers such as Amazon. We believe our strong relationships with retailers have been established through many years of personal customer service and adherence to meeting or exceeding retailer expectations. Our Wilsons Leather retail stores provide an additional distribution network for our products. We distribute our G.H. Bass products through our G.H. Bass outlet stores and through licensees, and distribute Vilebrequin products through a network of company owned and franchised specialty retail stores and shops, as well as through select wholesale distribution channels. Our DKNY and Donna Karan products are sold through wholesale distribution, licensees and our own DKNY outlet stores. 
 Superior design, sourcing and quality control.   Our in-house design and merchandising teams design substantially all of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. Our designers work closely with our licensors and private label customers to create designs and styles that represent the look they want. We have a network of worldwide suppliers that allows us to negotiate competitive terms without relying on any

  single vendor. In addition, we employ a quality control team and a sourcing group in China to ensure the quality of our products. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of our design capabilities, sourcing expertise, on-time delivery and high standards of quality control. 
 Leadership position in the wholesale business.   As one of the largest wholesalers of outerwear, dresses and sportswear, we are widely recognized within the apparel industry for our high-quality and well-designed products. Our expertise and reputation in designing, manufacturing and marketing apparel have enabled us to build strong customer relationships and to become one of the leading dress suppliers in the United States over the past several years. We have also expanded into women’s performance wear and other apparel categories, as well as to non-apparel categories such as handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. 
 Experienced management team.   Our executive management team has worked together for a significant period of time and has extensive experience in the apparel industry. Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has been with us for over 40 years. Sammy Aaron, our Vice Chairman and President, joined us in 2005 when we acquired Marvin Richards, Wayne S. Miller, our Chief Operating Officer, has been with us for almost 20 years, Neal S. Nackman, our Chief Financial Officer, has been with us for almost 15 years and Jeffrey Goldfarb, our Executive Vice President, has been with us for 15 years. Our leadership team has demonstrated experience in successfully acquiring, managing, integrating and positioning new businesses having completed nine acquisitions over the last twelve years, while also adding numerous new licenses and licensed products. 
 Growth Strategy 
 Our goal is to continue to expand our position as an all-season diversified apparel and accessories company with a broad portfolio of brands that we offer in multiple channels of retail distribution through the following growth strategies: 
 Execute diversification initiatives.   We are continually seeking opportunities to produce products for all seasons. Over the past five years we have diversified through the acquisition and licensing of well-known brands. We have initiated the following diversification efforts: 
 •

 In December 2016, we acquired Donna Karan, which we believe owns some of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan and DKNY Jeans. The acquisition of Donna Karan fits squarely into our strategy to diversify and expand our business. We intend to focus on the expansion of the DKNY brand, while also re-establishing DKNY Jeans, Donna Karan and other associated brands. We believe that our strong track record of driving organic growth, identifying and integrating acquisitions and developing talent throughout the organization makes the potential of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands especially appealing. 
 ​
 •

 In March 2017, we entered into an agreement with Macy’s under which Macy’s will serve, beginning February 2018, as the exclusive U.S. department store for sales of DKNY women’s apparel and accessories. Under the agreement, Macy’s will have the exclusive rights to sell DKNY women’s apparel, including. women’s sportswear, dresses, suit separates, sport, denim, swim and outerwear, as well as, handbags and women’s shoes in all Macy’s locations and Macys.com. The agreement also plans for increased and enhanced DKNY shop-in-shops in many Macy’s stores. G-III and Macy’s are committed to making DKNY the premier fashion and lifestyle brand. Products outside of women’s apparel and accessories and all products distributed by DKNY’s various licensees will continue to be sold to a broad range of department stores, including Macy’s. We also intend to re-launch Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that will be priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores.
 ​
 •

 In February 2016, we expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger through a new license for womenswear which includes sportswear, suit separates, performance and denim. These categories are in addition to our other licenses for Tommy Hilfiger dresses, men’s and women’s outerwear and luggage. We believe that Tommy Hilfiger is a classic American lifestyle brand. We intend to leverage our market expertise to help build sales of Tommy Hilfiger women’s appeal.

 In February 2016, we expanded our partnership with respect to the Karl Lagerfeld brand through the acquisition of an approximately 19% minority interest in the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. In June 2015, we entered into a joint venture pursuant to which we acquired a 49% ownership interest in an entity that holds brand rights to the Karl Lagerfeld trademarks for consumer products (with certain exceptions) and apparel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We are also the first licensee of the joint venture, having been granted a license for women’s apparel, women’s handbags and men’s outerwear. 
 ​
 •

 We have continually expanded our relationship with Calvin Klein, our most important license relationship. Initially, we had licenses for Calvin Klein men’s and women’s outerwear. Between 2005 and 2013, we added licenses for women’s suits, dresses, women’s performance wear, women’s better sportswear, men’s and women’s swimwear, women’s handbags and small leather goods and luggage, as well as to operate Calvin Klein Performance retail stores in the United States. In March 2014, the term of each of our Calvin Klein license agreements was extended to December 31, 2023. 
 ​
 Continue to grow our apparel business.   We have been a leader in the apparel business for many years and believe we can continue to grow our apparel business. Specifically, our Calvin Klein businesses benefit from Calvin Klein’s strong brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. Most recently, we acquired the Donna Karan business, including the DKNY brand, and added licenses for womenswear, outerwear and dresses under the Tommy Hilfiger brand. Our acquisition of Andrew Marc added two well-known proprietary brands in the men’s and women’s apparel market, as well as licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear under the Levi’s and Dockers brands. 
 Grow our licensing business.   As we have increased our portfolio of proprietary brands, we have licensed these brands in categories outside our core competencies. We began licensing Vilebrequin and G.H. Bass in selected categories after acquiring these brands in 2012 and 2013. We expect to significantly increase our licensing program as a result of our ownership of the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. Donna Karan and DKNY are some of the world’s most iconic and recognizable power brands. We believe that we can capitalize on significant, untapped global licensing potential in a number of men’s categories, as well as in home and jewelry. G-III intends to grow royalty streams through expansion of additional categories with existing Donna Karan and DKNY licensees, as well as new categories with new licensees. We also plan to continue seeking licensing opportunities for other brands we own such as G.H. Bass, Andrew Marc and Vilebrequin. 
 Add new product categories.   We have been able to leverage our expertise and experience in the apparel business, our relationships with our licensors and our sourcing capabilities to expand our licenses to new product categories such as dresses, sportswear, women’s suits, women’s performance wear, footwear and men’s and women’s swimwear. We expanded our licenses with Calvin Klein beyond apparel categories to include women’s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. In addition, we added luggage to the products we sell under the Tommy Hilfiger brand and added swimwear, resort wear and related accessories as a result of our acquisition of Vilebrequin. Our acquisition of G.H. Bass added footwear to our product mix. We will attempt to expand our distribution of products in these and other categories under licensed brands, our own brands, including the recently acquired Donna Karan brands, and private label brands. 
 Products — Development and Design 
 G-III designs, manufactures and markets women’s and men’s apparel at a wide range of retail price points. Our product offerings primarily include outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women’s suits and women’s performance wear. We also market footwear and accessories including women’s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. 
 G-III’s licensed apparel consists of both women’s and men’s products in a broad range of categories. See “Business — Licensing.” Our strategy is to seek licenses that will enable us to offer a range of products targeting different price points and different distribution channels. We also offer a wide range of products under our own proprietary brands.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  We work with a diversified group of retail chains, such as Costco, Express, Kohl’s, JC Penney, Ross Stores, Lord & Taylor and Stein Mart in developing product lines that are sold under their private label programs. Our design teams collaborate with our customers to produce custom made products for department and specialty chain stores. Store buyers may provide samples to us or may select styles already available in our showrooms. We believe we have established a reputation among these buyers for our ability to produce high quality product on a reliable, expeditious and cost-effective basis. 
 Our in-house designers are responsible for the design and look of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. We work closely with our licensors to create designs and styles for each of our licensed brands. Licensors generally must approve products to be sold under their brand names prior to production. We maintain a global pulse on styles, using trend services and color services to enable us to quickly respond to style changes in the apparel industry. Our experienced design personnel and our focused use of outside services enable us to incorporate current trends and consumer preferences in designing new products and styles. 
 Our design personnel meet regularly with our sales and merchandising departments, as well as with the design and merchandising staffs of our licensors, to review market trends, sales results and the popularity of our latest products. In addition, our representatives regularly attend trade and fashion shows and shop at fashion forward stores in the United States, Europe and the Far East for inspiration. Our designers present sample items along with their evaluation of the styles expected to be in demand in the United States. We also seek input from selected customers with respect to product design. We believe that our sensitivity to the needs of retailers, coupled with the flexibility of our production capabilities and our continual monitoring of the retail market, enables us to modify designs and order specifications in a timely fashion. 
 Wholesale Operations 
 Our wholesale operations segment includes sales of products licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our own proprietary brands and private label brands. Revenues from our wholesale operations accounted for 80.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to 79.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and 77.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. Revenues from the wholesale operations of Donna Karan are included for the last two months of fiscal 2017. 
Licensed Products 
 The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for more than 20 years. In July 2016, we signed a three-year extension through March 2020 of our license agreement with the National Football League. We have expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger to include a license for womenswear in February 2016. Our Tommy Hilfiger dress license entered into in April 2015 was incorporated into the women’s wear license effective January 1, 2017. In June 2015, we entered into a license for Karl Lagerfeld women’s apparel, women’s handbags and men’s outerwear. In October 2015, we announced the launch of Hands High, a new licensed sports apparel line inspired by Tonight Show host, Jimmy Fallon.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Under our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve minimum net sales of licensed products, pay guaranteed minimum royalties, make specified royalty and advertising payments (usually based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products), and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. License agreements also may restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of these requirements or otherwise fail to meet our obligations under a license agreement, a licensor usually will have the right to terminate our license. License agreements also typically restrict our ability to assign or transfer the agreement without the prior written consent of a licensor and generally provide that a change in control, including as a result of the acquisition of us by another company, is considered to be a transfer of the license agreement that would give a licensor the right to terminate the license unless it has approved the transaction. 
 Our ability to renew the current term of a license agreement may be subject to the discretion of the licensor or to attaining minimum sales and/or royalty levels and to our compliance with the provisions of the agreement. We believe that brand owners are looking to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and to choose licensees who have a successful track record of developing brands. We continue to seek other opportunities to enter into license agreements in order to expand our product offerings under well-known labels and broaden the markets that we serve. 
 Proprietary Brands 
 Dating back to the beginning of our company, G-III has sold apparel under our own proprietary brands. Over the years, we developed or acquired brands such as G-III Sports by Carl Banks, Eliza J, Jessica Howard and Andrew Marc. We acquired G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand, and Vilebrequin, which provides us with a premier brand selling status products worldwide. Most recently, we acquired Donna Karan which, along with DKNY, are iconic and recognizable power brands. 
Donna Karan
 The Donna Karan business has a portfolio of some of the world’s most iconic fashion brands, including DKNY, Donna Karan and DKNY Jeans. First launched in 1984, Donna Karan designs, sources, markets, retails, and distributes collections of women’s and men’s clothing, sportswear, accessories and shoes under the DKNY and Donna Karan brand names. 
 The Donna Karan’s wholesale business derives its revenues from two sources: 
 •

 Wholesale — Donna Karan maintains partnerships with Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue, Harrods and Harvey Nichols, as well as best-in-class international distributors. 
 ​
 •

 Royalties — Donna Karan maintains strong relationships with category leading license partners, including Estee Lauder, Fossil, Hanes and Luxottica. 
 ​
 Over the last two years under its prior ownership, Donna Karan has undergone a significant restructuring and repositioning of its business. Significant steps were taken to elevate the brand and reduce overhead costs. In wholesale, Donna Karan exited the Donna Karan Collection, DKNY Jeans and DKNYC lines. It significantly reduced distribution by reducing or eliminating sales to off-price and club accounts. Certain company initiatives to elevate the DKNY brand (e.g., less logo product) also impacted sales and distribution. Although strong license relationships remain, royalty revenues have decreased due to terminated license agreements and underperformance of certain licensees due to both company-specific and sector trends. With Donna Karan’s significant brand equity, we believe there are opportunities to expand existing categories, launch new initiatives and develop a strong licensing and distribution base. We believe that the DKNY brand has the potential for significant growth. In addition, other areas for growth include the relaunch of Donna Karan Collection and DKNY Jeans, as well as increased licensing revenues. We expect sales growth across multiple categories, led by sportswear, jeans and footwear. 
 The distribution agreement we signed with Macy’s in March 2017 will provide us with the opportunity to distribute through Macy’s retail network a total wardrobe for a woman’s active, modern lifestyle. New products developed will reflect the DKNY brand DNA and emphasize a strong price-value relationship. We believe that DKNY has the potential to be the premier fashion and lifestyle brand. Products outside of

  women’s apparel and accessories and all products distributed by DKNY’s various licensees will continue to be sold to a broad range of department stores, including Macy’s. G-III will also maintain DKNY’s agreements with international brand partners and distributors outside of the United States. 
 We also believe that the traditional Donna Karan brand also contains significant growth potential. We intend to re-launch Donna Karan as an aspirational luxury brand that will be priced above DKNY and targeted to fine department stores. 
 Additionally, we believe there is untapped global licensing potential in several men’s categories, as well as home and jewelry. G-III intends to grow royalty streams through expansion of additional categories with existing licensees, as well as new categories with new licensees. 
 Donna Karan also strengthens our online retail channels and brick-and-mortar store base. We believe there are multiple opportunities to focus and enhance the DKNY and Donna Karan’s websites, prudently expand retail stores over the long term, including through conversion of stores within the existing G-III retail base, and capitalize on industry relationships to ensure premium product placement in department and other retail stores nationwide. The distribution agreement we signed with Macy’s provides us with the opportunity to bring together DKNY’s remarkable global brand recognition and Macy’s footprint as one of the largest nationwide retailers. 
 Vilebrequin
 Vilebrequin is a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. Vilebrequin sells its products in over 50 countries around the world. Vilebrequin has also licensed its brand for the wholesale distribution of watches and sunglasses. We believe that Vilebrequin is capable of significant worldwide expansion. A majority of Vilebrequin’s current revenues are derived from sales in Europe and the United States. As of January 31, 2017, Vilebrequin products were distributed through 88 company-operated stores, as well as through 58 franchised locations, an e-commerce store in both Europe and the United States and select wholesale distribution. 
 Vilebrequin’s iconic designs and reputation are linked to its French Riviera heritage arising from its founding in St. Tropez over forty years ago. Vilebrequin’s men’s swimwear, which accounts for the majority of its sales, is known for its exclusive prints, wide range of colors, attention to detail, fabric quality and well-designed cut. In addition to swimwear, Vilebrequin sells a line of resort wear products, including shirts, T-shirts, Bermuda shorts and trousers, and related accessories, including hats, beach bags, beach towels, shoes, sunglasses and watches. Vilebrequin also offers a collection of women’s swimwear and resort wear. We believe that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand. We plan to continue adding more company operated and franchised retail locations and increase our wholesale distribution of Vilebrequin product throughout the world, as well as develop the business beyond its heritage in men’s swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. 
 Andrew Marc
 Andrew Marc and Marc New York provide us with upscale company-owned brands. We utilize our own in-house capabilities to create our core men’s and women’s outerwear and women’s performance wear. We also license these brands to select third parties in certain categories. 
Retail Operations 
 We are a national retailer of outerwear, apparel, footwear and accessories in the United States. As of January 31, 2017, our retail operations segment consisted of 411 leased retail stores, of which 190 are stores operated under our Wilsons Leather name, 163 are stores operated under our G.H. Bass brand, 50 stores are operated under our DKNY brand, 5 stores are operated under the licensed Calvin Klein Performance brand and 3 stores are operated under the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand. Each of Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY also operates its own online store. 
 Substantially all of our Wilsons Leather, G.H. Bass and DKNY stores are operated as outlet stores and located in larger outlet centers. Wilsons Leather’s stores average approximately 3,614 square feet, Bass stores average approximately 5,869 square feet and DKNY stores average approximately 3,995 square feet. Given the current retail environment, we have decided to rationalize our retail operations by closing

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  underperforming locations, renegotiating certain of our lease agreements and focusing our efforts on the most profitable stores. We expect aggregate store count to decline over the next few years and anticipate closing 60 stores by the end of fiscal 2018 and, possibly, an additional 55 stores by the end of fiscal 2019. We are also planning to close 4 DKNY stores in fiscal 2018. The prior owner of the Donna Karan business closed approximately 25 Donna Karan and DKNY stores since 2014 prior to our acquisition of the business. 
 Our Wilsons Leather retail stores primarily sell men’s and women’s outerwear and accessories. Outerwear sold in our Wilsons Leather stores includes both products sold to us by G-III’s wholesale operations segment, as well as products sourced by us. Accessories are purchased from third parties. Merchandise is shipped from our main Brooklyn Park, Minnesota distribution center, as well as four regional distribution centers, to replenish stores as needed with key styles and to build inventory for the peak holiday selling season. 
 Our G.H. Bass stores offer casual and dress shoes for men and women. Most of our G.H. Bass stores also carry apparel for men and women, including tops, bottoms and outerwear, as well as accessories such as handbags, wallets, belts and travel gear. G.H. Bass stores sell footwear, apparel and accessories under the G.H. Bass brand. It also sells footwear under our Weejuns brand. We sell G.H. Bass products through outlet stores located in the United States. We also license the G.H. Bass brand for the wholesale distribution of men’s and women’s footwear, men’s sportswear, men’s and boy’s tailored clothing, men’s socks, women’s hosiery and accessories.
 Our DKNY stores offer a large range of products including sportswear, sport, dresses, suit separates, outerwear, handbags, footwear, intimates, sleepwear, hosiery, watches and eyewear. Envisioned as a complete lifestyle shopping experience, the DKNY stores aim to transport the customer into the DKNY brand from the moment they enter the city of DKNY. The DKNY merchandising philosophy will be designed around the principles of zones and classifications to establish a consistent product message and category “ownerships” as well as product presentations with a distinctly DKNY point of view.
 Revenues from our retail operations, before intercompany eliminations, accounted for 19.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to 20.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and 22.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. Revenues from DKNY’s retail operations are included for the last two months of fiscal 2017. 
 Manufacturing and Sourcing 
 G-III arranges for the production of products from independent manufacturers located primarily in China and, to a lesser extent, in Vietnam, Indonesia, Jordan, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar and Central and South America. Vilebrequin’s products are manufactured in Bulgaria, Italy, Tunisia, Turkey and Morocco. A small portion of our garments are manufactured in the United States. 
 We currently have representative offices in Hangzhou, Nanjing and Qingdao, Donguan, China, as well as in Vietnam and Indonesia. These offices act as our liaison with manufacturers in the Far East. As of January 31, 2017, we had 374 employees in these representative offices. 
 G-III’s headquarters provides these liaison offices with production orders stating the quantity, quality, delivery time and types of garments to be produced. The personnel in our liaison offices assist in the negotiation and placement of orders with manufacturers. In allocating production among independent suppliers, we consider a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, quality, availability of production capacity, pricing and ability to meet changing production requirements. 
 To facilitate better service for our customers and accommodate the volume of manufacturing in the Far East, we also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong subsidiary supports third party production of products on an agency fee basis. Our Hong Kong office acts as an agent for substantially all of our production. Our China and Hong Kong offices monitor production at manufacturers’ facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our specifications and timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities and, in some cases, direct to our customers. At January 31, 2017, we had 31 employees in our Hong Kong office.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In connection with the foreign manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric, wool, leather and other submaterials (such as linings, zippers, buttons and trim) at our direction. Prior to commencing the manufacture of products, samples of raw materials or submaterials are sent to us for approval. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to ensure timely delivery, maintain quality control and monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications. We also inspect finished products at the factory site. 
 We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against casualty losses arising during shipping. 
 As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available. 
 A majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our distribution facilities or to designated third party facilities for final inspection and allocation, as well as reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment (principally ship, truck or air) based upon a customer’s needs, cost and timing considerations. 
 Customs and Import Restrictions 
 Our arrangements with textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to requisite customs clearances for textile apparel and the imposition of export duties. United States Customs duties on our textile apparel presently range from duty free to 32%, depending upon the type of fabric used, how the garment is constructed and the country of export. A substantial majority of our product is imported into the United States and, to a lesser extent, into Canada and Europe. Countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions or adjust prevailing duty or tariff levels, as well as quota restrictions. Any action by the new administration in the United States to increase tariffs on imported goods would adversely affect our business. Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) agreement governing international trade in textiles, known as the “WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,” the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions generally do not affect our business in most countries. 
 Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulations that relate to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. 
 Raw Materials 
 We purchase substantially all of the products manufactured for us on a finished goods basis. We coordinate the sourcing of raw materials used in the production of our products which are generally available from numerous sources. The apparel industry competes with manufacturers of many other products for the supply of raw materials. In prior years, the majority of our raw material inventory consisted of leather skins. Until recently, we provided these raw materials to one of our subcontractors in China to manufacture some of our leather products. Going forward, we are planning to work with manufacturers who use their own leather skins inventory. 
Marketing and Distribution 
 G-III’s products are sold primarily to department, specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the United States. We sell to approximately 2,400 customers, ranging from national and regional chains to small specialty stores. We also distribute our products through our retail stores and, to a lesser extent, through our DKNY, G.H. Bass, Wilsons Leather, Vilebrequin and Andrew Marc websites.

  Sales to our 10 largest customers accounted for 64.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to 63.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and 58.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. Sales to Macy’s, which includes sales to its Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s store chains, as well as through macys.com, accounted for an aggregate of 21.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2017 compared to 20.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and 18.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. Sales to Macy’s may increase as a percentage of our net sales as a result of our new expanded license agreement with Tommy Hilfiger and sales of DKNY product to Macy’s, including as a result of the distribution agreement entered into in March 2017. The loss of this customer or a significant reduction in purchases by our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 A substantial majority of our sales are made in the United States. We also market our products in Canada, Europe and the Far East, which, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 8.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. See Note K to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information with respect to revenues and long-lived assets attributed by geographic region. 
 G-III’s products are sold primarily through a direct sales force consisting of 260 employees at January 31, 2017. Our principal executives are also actively involved in sales of our products. Some of our products are also sold by independent sales representatives located throughout the United States. The Canadian market is serviced by a sales and customer service team based both in the United States and in Canada. Sales outside of the United States are managed by 13 salespeople located in our offices across Asia. At January 31, 2017, (i) the Donna Karan direct sales force consisted of 54 sales people located in the United States and in Europe, (ii) we employed 8 salespeople located in Canada with respect to sales of Kensie product and (iii) Vilebrequin employed 13 salespeople, most of them located across Europe. 
 Brand name products sold by us pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by institutional and product advertisements placed by the licensor. Our license agreements generally require us to pay the licensor a fee, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed product, to pay for a portion of these advertising costs. We may also be required to spend a specified percentage of net sales of a licensed product on advertising placed by us. 
 Our marketing and press efforts on behalf of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands are highly focused around communicating brand DNA and visual identity for the new evolution of DKNY and Donna Karan. We are seeking to re-build the brand image through high impact ad campaigns that feature socially relevant talent. We are striving to create noteworthy marketing initiatives, collaborations and image programs to build brand awareness and bring in a new young customer. Donna Karan and DKNY will continue to support global licensees with brand campaigns and product images to tell the brand story. We expect to invest in digital media and storytelling for brand amplification and to establish comprehensive commercial marketing tools that will support our global wholesale and retail channels. 
 Marketing efforts by Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass are primarily focused on increasing store traffic and then converting customers to buyers. This goal is mainly accomplished through our customer relations programs, local advertising and mall marketing promotions along with marketing initiatives through the Internet, social media and public relations support. We continue to revitalize and build the G.H. Bass heritage brand through products featuring new design and comfort technology, improved assortments and additional category licenses with strong partners. 
 Vilebrequin’s marketing efforts have been based on continually offering new swimwear prints and expanding the range of its products to new categories such as women’s swimwear, ready to wear and accessories. Besides its traditional advertising networks (print and outdoor advertising), Vilebrequin is seeking to develop new marketing channels through the use of digital media, product placement and public relations. Through the growth of its network of stores, distributors and franchisees, Vilebrequin is seeking to reinforce its position in its traditional markets, such as the United States and Europe, and to develop new markets in Asia and the Middle East. 
 We advertise our Andrew Marc brand and are engaged in both cooperative advertising programs with retailers and direct to the consumer. We are focused on creating an image that will broaden the lifestyle appeal of our Andrew Marc brands. Our marketing strategy is focused on media, public relations and channel marketing. Our media strategy for Andrew Marc includes traditional print, such as catalogs, and outdoor advertising, as well as digital and social media initiatives.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  We believe we have developed awareness of our other owned labels primarily through our reputation, consumer acceptance and the fashion press. We primarily rely on our reputation and relationships to generate business in the private label portion of our wholesale operations segment. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of, among other things, our standards of quality control, on-time delivery, competitive pricing and willingness and ability to assist customers in their merchandising of our products. 
Seasonality 
 Retail sales of outerwear and other apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, we have been dependent on our sales from July through November for the substantial majority of our net sales and net income. Net sales in the months of July through November accounted for approximately 54% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 57% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and 56% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. The second half of the year is expected to continue to provide a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our net income for the foreseeable future. The addition of the Donna Karan businesses is not expected to significantly impact the seasonality of our business. 
Order Book 
 A portion of our orders consists of short-term purchase orders from customers who place orders on an as-needed basis. Information relative to open purchase orders at any date may also be materially affected by, among other things, the timing of the initial showing of apparel to the trade, as well as by the timing of recording of orders and shipments. As a result, we do not believe that disclosure of the amount of our unfilled customer orders at any time is meaningful. 
Competition 
 We have numerous competitors with respect to the sale of our products, including brand owners, distributors that import products from abroad, and domestic retailers with established foreign manufacturing capabilities. Some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources and greater manufacturing capacity than we do. Our retail business competes against a diverse group of retailers, including, among others, other outlet stores, department stores, specialty stores, warehouse clubs and e-commerce retailers. Sales of our products are affected by style, price, quality, brand reputation and general fashion trends. 
Trademarks 
 We own some of the trademarks used by us in connection with our wholesale operations segment, as well as almost all of the trademarks used in our retail operations segment. We act as licensee of certain trademarks owned by third parties that are used in connection with our wholesale operations segment. The principal brands that we license are summarized under the heading “Licensing” above. We own a number of proprietary brands that we use in connection with our business and products including, among others, DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, G.H. Bass, Weejuns, Wilsons, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J, Jessica Howard and G-III Sports by Carl Banks. We have registered, or applied for registration of, many of our trademarks in multiple jurisdictions for use on a variety of apparel and related other products. 
 In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our attempt to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks that would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets or in new product categories, we cannot be sure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional brands to new markets. 
 We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement.
