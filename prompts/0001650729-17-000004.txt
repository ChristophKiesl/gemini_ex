Item 1. Business
The following discussion of our business contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in “Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information” above. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks as set forth in Part I, Item 1A, ‘‘Risk Factors’’ below. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Company Overview
We are the largest and only national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies in the United States and have a growing presence in Canada. Our customers are primarily residential and commercial landscape professionals who specialize in the design, installation and maintenance of lawns, gardens, golf courses and other outdoor spaces. As of March 10, 2017, we had 469 branch locations in 45 states and five provinces. Through our expansive North American network, we offer a comprehensive selection of more than 100,000 SKUs including irrigation supplies, fertilizer and control products (e.g., herbicides), landscape accessories, nursery goods, hardscapes (including pavers, natural stones and blocks), outdoor lighting and ice melt products. We also provide value-added consultative services to complement our product offering and to help our customers operate and grow their businesses. Based on our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales, we estimate that we are more than four times the size of our largest competitor and larger than the next two through ten competitors combined. We believe, based on management’s estimates, that we have either the number one or number two local market position in nearly 80% of MSAs where we have one or more branches. Our market leadership, coast-to-coast presence, broad product selection and extensive technical expertise provide us with significant competitive advantages and create a compelling value proposition for both our customers and suppliers.
Our customers choose us for a number of reasons, including the breadth and availability of the products we offer, our high level of expertise, the quality of our customer service, the convenience of our branch locations and the consistency of our timely delivery. Our ability to provide a “one-stop shop” experience for our customers is aligned with the growing trend of landscape contractors providing an increasingly broad array of products and services. Because extensive technical knowledge and experience are required to successfully design, install and maintain outdoor spaces, we believe our customers find great value in the advice and recommendations provided by our knowledgeable sales and service associates, many of whom are former landscape contractors or golf course superintendents. Our consultative services include assistance with irrigation network design, commercial project planning, generation of sales leads, marketing services and product support, as well as a series of technical and business management seminars that we call SiteOne University. These value-added services foster an ongoing relationship with our customers that is a key element of our business strategy.
We have a diverse base of more than 180,000 customers, and our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 4% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales, with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of net sales. Our typical customer is a private landscape contractor that operates in a single market. We interact regularly with our customers because of the recurring nature of landscape services and because most contractors buy products on an as-needed basis. We believe our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty and drives repeat business. In addition, our broad product portfolio, convenient branch locations and nationwide fleet of over 1,400 delivery vehicles position us well to meet the needs of our customers and ensure timely delivery of products.
Our strong supplier relationships support our ability to provide a broad selection of products at attractive prices. We believe we are the largest customer for many of our key suppliers, who benefit from the size and scale of our distribution network. We source our products from more than 2,500 suppliers, including the major irrigation equipment manufacturers, turf and ornamental fertilizer/chemical companies and a variety of suppliers who specialize in nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes and other landscape products. Some of our largest suppliers include Hunter, Rain Bird, Toro, Oldcastle, Bayer, Syngenta, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Vista and NDS. We also develop and sell products under our proprietary and market-leading brands LESCO and Green Tech, which together accounted for approximately 19% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales. We believe these highly recognized brands attract customers to our branches and create incremental sales opportunities for other products.
We have a balanced mix of sales across product categories, construction sectors and end markets. We derived approximately 54% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales from the residential construction sector, 31% from the commercial (including institutional) 
3

construction sector and 15% from the recreational and other construction sector. By end market, we derived approximately 43% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales from maintenance of residential, commercial and recreational properties. The recurring nature of landscape maintenance demand helps to provide stability in our financial performance across economic cycles. Fertilizer and control products are the primary products used in maintenance. The sale of products relating to new construction of homes, commercial buildings and recreational spaces accounted for approximately 39% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales. These products primarily include irrigation, nursery, hardscapes, outdoor lighting and landscape accessories. We expect sales in the new construction end market to continue to grow as a result of the ongoing recovery in the demand for new single-family homes, multi-family housing units and non-residential buildings. Approximately 18% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales were derived from sales of products for the repair and upgrade of existing landscapes. These sales benefit from increasing existing home sales, increasing home prices and rising consumer spending.
Net Sales for 2016 Fiscal Year
As of March 10, 2017, we have completed the acquisition of 16 companies since the CD&R Acquisition (as defined below) in December 2013, and we intend to pursue additional acquisitions to complement our organic growth and achieve our strategic objectives. Our organic and acquisition-driven growth strategies have led to significant increases in net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. For our 2016 Fiscal Year, we generated net sales of $1,648.2 million, net income of $30.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $134.3 million, compared to net sales of $1,451.6 million, net income of $28.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $106.5 million for our 2015 Fiscal Year. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Quarterly Results of Operations Data” for a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). 
Our Executive Leadership
Doug Black joined us as our Chief Executive Officer in April 2014. Mr. Black is the former President and COO of Oldcastle, the North American arm of CRH plc, where he helped grow net sales by over ten times and oversaw more than 100 acquisitions, including Oldcastle’s expansion into building products distribution. Mr. Black has joined a strong operational team with top-tier associates who have positively contributed to our performance. Mr. Black has also strengthened the capabilities of our executive leadership team by bringing in highly qualified senior managers with functional expertise in strategy development, mergers and acquisitions, talent management, marketing, category management, supply chain management, national sales and information technology. These individuals have prior experience at a number of well-known companies within the building products and industrial distribution sectors, including Oldcastle, HD Supply, Grainger, MSC Industrial Direct, Wesco, Newell Rubbermaid and The Home Depot.
Under Mr. Black’s leadership, we have established a focused business strategy to develop and attract industry-leading talent, deliver more value to customers, generate superior financial performance, drive organic growth, execute on attractive acquisitions and increase working capital efficiency. We are also undertaking a variety of initiatives targeting pricing, category management, sales force performance and supply chain management. At the local level, we have increased our focus on gaining market share by adding capabilities to our 50 geographic areas and 469 branches and by empowering area managers and their teams to develop local strategies. These initiatives are in the early stages of implementation, and we believe they will continue to enhance our growth and profitability.
Our Industry
Based on management’s estimates, we believe that our addressable market in North America for the wholesale distribution of landscape supplies represented approximately $17 billion in revenue in 2016. Growth in our industry is driven by a broad array of factors, including consumer spending, housing starts, existing home sales, home prices, commercial construction, repair and remodeling spending, and demographic trends. Within the wholesale landscape supply distribution industry, products sold for residential applications represent the largest construction sector, followed by the commercial and recreational & other sectors. Based on management estimates, we believe 
4

that nursery products represent the largest product category in the industry, with sales accounting for more than one-third of industry sales, followed by landscape accessories with approximately one-fifth of industry sales and each of control products, hardscapes, irrigation products and outdoor lighting, and fertilizer & other accounting for approximately one-tenth of industry sales.
The wholesale landscape supply distribution industry is highly fragmented, consisting primarily of regional private businesses that typically have a small geographic footprint, a limited product offering and limited supplier relationships. Wholesale landscape supply distributors primarily sell to landscape service firms, ranging from sole proprietorships to national enterprises. Landscape service firms include general landscape contractors and specialty landscape firms, such as lawn care, tree and foliage maintenance firms. Over the past decade, professional landscape contractors have increasingly offered additional products and services to meet their customers’ needs. These firms historically needed to make numerous trips to branches in various locations to source their products. Consequently, landscape professionals have come to value distribution partners who offer a “one-stop shop” with a larger variety of products and services, particularly given the recurring nature of landscape maintenance services.
According to an August 2015 Freedonia Group report, the U.S. wholesale landscape supply distribution industry was expected to grow at a CAGR meaningfully higher than that of the overall economy through 2019. Hardscape and outdoor lighting products were expected to grow the fastest of our major landscape product categories through 2019 at an estimated CAGR of 7.3% and 8.1%, respectively. 
Residential Construction Sector Growth Trends
The purchase of a home, whether new or existing, is a common reason for upgrading or modifying lawns, gardens and other outdoor spaces. Industry surveys indicate that the majority of homeowners prefer to hire landscape professionals for help with their outdoor projects.
Growth in the market for landscape products is primarily driven by new residential construction. Housing starts are expected to grow 6% in 2017 to 1.2 million and 8% in 2018 to 1.3 million, according to the National Association of Home Builders. The chart below sets forth the total number of U.S. housing starts from 2000 through 2015, NAHB’s projected numbers for 2016 through 2018 and the long-term median (1959-2015).
Historical and projected U.S. total housing starts (in thousands)

Rising interest in more complex, decorative and functional landscaping spurred by the recent popularity of home and garden television shows and magazines has further boosted demand for professional landscape services. The increasingly popular concept of “outdoor living,” which involves relaxation, entertainment and spending more time with family and friends outdoors, continues to drive higher demand for landscape solutions that provide more functional living space and increase the value of the home. Freedonia projects that demand for outdoor lighting will increase as homeowners continue to enhance property values with architectural features, monuments and plants that warrant illumination during non-daylight hours. In addition, an increasing shift from AC to low voltage DC power sources and advances in LED technology simplify installation and facilitate more reliable and attractive outdoor lighting systems.
As residents face lawn watering restrictions resulting from recent drought conditions in the Western and Southern regions of the United States, demand for eco-friendly landscape products that promote water conservation has also grown meaningfully. This includes the use of hardscapes as lawn substitutes as well as smart water systems for increased water efficiency.
Another growth driver in our industry includes residential repair and remodel spending, which has historically been less cyclical than spending on new residential construction. According to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies as of January 2016, the U.S. 
5

home improvement products market reached a peak of $277 billion in 2006 before declining by approximately 20% to $222 billion in 2009. The industry has since rebounded to an estimated $297 billion in 2016.
Driven by the rebound in existing home sales, rising home prices, the ongoing rehabilitation of previously foreclosed properties, the availability of consumer capital at low interest rates, the increasing age of U.S. housing stock and demand for energy-efficient projects, industry analysts expect significant long-term growth in residential repair and remodel expenditures. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies forecasts that the home improvement products market will grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2015 to 2017.

Commercial and Recreational Construction Sector Growth Trends
Demand for landscape products in the commercial and recreational construction sector is driven by factors such as new building construction and companies renovating the exteriors of their facilities to attract new customers and tenants. Additionally, eco-friendly landscape products are frequently specified by design professionals for use in commercial, institutional and municipal landscape irrigation applications. Technology solutions include fully integrated rainwater harvesting/reuse systems, organic fertilizers, remote water management systems, energy efficient pump systems and solar-powered irrigation controller assemblies.
The non-residential construction market has rebounded strongly following the 2008-2009 recession with steady growth through 2016. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, U.S. non-residential construction spending is forecasted to grow 7% in 2017 and 6% in 2018. The chart below sets forth the total dollars spent on U.S. non-residential construction from 2006 to 2018.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we benefit from the following competitive strengths:
Clear Market Leader in an Attractive Industry
We are the largest wholesale distributor of landscape supplies in the United States. Based on our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales, we estimate that we are more than four times the size of our largest competitor and larger than the next two through ten competitors combined.
 We believe, based on management’s estimates, that we have either the number one or number two local market position in nearly 80% of MSAs where we have at least one branch. Our industry is highly fragmented, comprised of thousands of small, private or family-run businesses that compete with us primarily on a local market basis. We are the only national distributor in the landscape supply industry, with an estimated market share of approximately 10% based on third quarter of 2016 Fiscal Year net sales. As a result, we believe we have significant opportunities to increase our market share. Our national scale, broad product and service offering and market leadership also enable us to play an important role in the landscape supplies value chain by connecting a large and diverse set of manufacturers with a highly fragmented customer base.
Broadest Product Offering
We believe we offer the industry’s most comprehensive portfolio of landscape products with over 100,000 SKUs from more than 2,500 suppliers. This broad product offering creates a “one-stop shop” for our customers and positively distinguishes us from our competitors. We maintain a high standard of product availability and timely delivery, which generally allows our customers to avoid investing significant capital to maintain their own inventory. In addition, our branches order specialty products directly from suppliers on behalf of our customers, who thereby benefit from our national purchasing scale, and we are able to supply custom services and products, such as fertilizers and soil blends, to meet specific job requirements. We also provide several proprietary products, including our LESCO and Green Tech brands, as well as promotional items offered through arrangements with selected manufacturers.
Superior Customer Value
We offer a variety of complementary, value-added services to support the sale of our products. At the local branch level, we have teams of experienced sales and service associates, many of whom are former landscape contractors or golf course superintendents. Our local staff provides customers with consultative services such as product selection and support, assistance with the design and implementation of landscape projects, and potential sales leads for new business opportunities. Our sales and service associates also coordinate the delivery of customer orders and help us to maintain our high delivery standards and fill rates. In addition, through our SiteOne University, we provide customers with technical training, licensing and business management seminars. We also offer a loyalty program, which we refer to as our Partners Program, under which customers can earn points redeemable for gift cards, account credits and other attractive commercial benefits. Our Partners Program, which had more than 12,000 enrolled customers as of January 1, 2017, also offers customers the opportunity to leverage our national buying power to purchase services for their businesses and employees. We believe the services we provide are an important differentiator that enhances the strength and longevity of our customer relationships.
Strong and Scalable Platform for Driving Growth
Our national scale and geographic footprint make us an attractive partner for our customers and suppliers. Over the past two and a half years, we have invested in management, corporate infrastructure and information systems for operating a company significantly larger than our current scale. Our local area and branch managers benefit from the substantial business and industry knowledge of our executive and senior operational management teams to help grow our business in their markets. We believe our platform can be leveraged to expand our customer base and grow our business with existing products and services, as well as to support the launch of new product offerings in our existing markets. We expect our greatest opportunities to expand will be in markets in which we currently operate but do not yet have a leading market position in one or more of our product categories.
Proven Ability to Identify, Execute and Integrate Acquisitions
We are a leading player in the consolidation of the fragmented industry for wholesale distribution of landscape supplies. Our current management team has extensive experience in identifying, executing and integrating acquisitions. Our industry leadership position, geographic footprint, ability to integrate acquisitions and access to financial resources make us the buyer of choice for many of our potential targets and give us an advantage over competing potential acquirers. As a result, we are able to achieve attractive multiples in primarily negotiated transactions. As of March 10, 2017, we have completed the acquisition of 16 companies since the CD&R Acquisition (as defined below) in December 2013, which we have integrated or are in the process of integrating into our business. A key element of our integration strategy is to achieve synergies at acquired companies from procurement, overhead cost reduction, sales initiatives and sharing of best practices across our organization. Our recent acquisitions have moved us into the leading position in several additional 
7

local markets or product categories. We expect the execution of synergistic acquisitions to continue to be an integral part of our growth strategy, and we intend to continue expanding our product line, geographic reach, market share and operational capabilities through future acquisitions.
Balanced Mix of Maintenance, New Construction and Repair and Upgrade Business
We have strategically invested in our product portfolio to position us to benefit from the ongoing recovery in the residential and commercial construction markets and to continue to benefit from stable growth of our maintenance products. We believe the new construction and repair and upgrade end markets provide us substantial upside in an economic upturn, and we are well-positioned to grow our business as a result of the continuing recovery in the housing sector and in construction spending for commercial buildings and facilities. In addition, our distribution of maintenance products provides a steady stream of more recurring sales, which we expect will further support our business through economic cycles. We believe our balanced sales mix in support of the maintenance, new construction and repair and upgrade end markets positions us to achieve consistent growth through our branch networks nationally.
Experienced and Proven Management Team Driving Organic and Acquisition Growth
We believe our management team, including regional vice presidents, area managers, area business managers and branch managers, is among the most experienced in the industry. Members of our executive leadership team have a strong track record of improving performance and successfully driving both internal and acquisitive growth during their tenure with SiteOne and prior to joining our company. Our team not only has a clearly defined operational strategy to promote growth and profitability for SiteOne but also an ambitious vision to be a world-class leader in the industry. We believe the scale of our business and our leading market position will allow us to continue to attract and develop industry-leading talent.
Our Strategies
We intend to leverage our competitive strengths to increase shareholder value through the following core strategies:
Build Upon Strong Customer and Supplier Relationships to Expand Organically
Our national footprint and broad supplier relationships, combined with our regular interaction with a large and diverse customer base, make us an important link in the supply chain for landscape products. Our suppliers benefit from access to our more than 180,000 customers, a single point of contact for improved production planning and efficiency, and our ability to bring new product launches quickly to market on a national scale. We intend to continue to increase our size and scale in customer, geographic and product reach, which we believe will continue to benefit our supplier base. Our customers in turn benefit from our local market leadership, talented associates, broad product offering and high inventory availability, timely delivery and complementary value-added services. We will continue to work with new and existing suppliers to maintain the most comprehensive product offering for our customers at competitive prices and enhance our role as a critical player in the supply chain. As we continue to grow, we believe our strong customer and supplier relationships will enable us to expand our market share in the landscape supplies industry.
Grow at the Local Level
The vast majority of our customers operate at a local level. We believe we can grow market share in our existing markets with limited capital investment by systematically executing local strategies to expand our customer base, increase the amount of our customers’ total spending with us, optimize our network of locations, coordinate multi-site deliveries, partner with strategic local suppliers, introduce new products and services, increase our share of underrepresented products in particular markets and improve sales force performance. We currently offer our full product line in only 24% of the U.S. MSAs where we have a branch, and therefore believe we have the capacity to offer significantly more product lines and services in our geographic markets.
Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions
Through recently completed acquisitions, we have added new markets in the United States and Canada, new product lines, talented associates and operational best practices. In addition, we increased our sales by introducing products from our existing portfolio to customers of newly acquired companies. We intend to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions to grow our market share and enhance our local market leadership positions by taking advantage of our scale, operational experience and acquisition know-how to pursue and integrate attractive targets. We believe we have significant opportunities to add product categories in our existing markets through acquisitions. In addition, we currently have branches in 177 of the 381 U.S. MSAs and are focused on identifying and reviewing attractive new geographic markets for expansion through acquisitions. We will continue to apply a selective and disciplined acquisition strategy to maximize synergies obtained from enhanced sales and lower procurement and corporate costs.
8

Execute on Identified Operational Initiatives
We have undertaken significant operational initiatives, utilizing our scale to improve our profitability, enhance supply chain efficiency, strengthen our pricing and category management capabilities, streamline and refine our marketing process and invest in more sophisticated information technology systems and data analytics. In addition, we work closely with our local area team leaders to improve sales, delivery and branch productivity. Although we are still in the early stages of these initiatives, they have already contributed to improvement in our profitability, and we believe we will continue to benefit from these and other operational improvements.
Be the Employer of Choice
We believe our associates are the key drivers of our success, and we aim to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our size and scale enable us to offer structured training and career path opportunities for our associates, while at the area and branch level we have built a vibrant and entrepreneurial culture that rewards performance. We promote ongoing, open and honest communication with our associates to ensure mutual trust, engagement and performance improvement. We believe that high-performing local leaders coupled with creative, adaptable and engaged associates are critical to our success and to maintaining our competitive position, and we are committed to being the employer of choice in our industry.
Our History and Ownership
Our company was established in 2001, when Deere & Company (“Deere”) entered the market for wholesale landscape distribution through the acquisition of McGinnis Farms, a supplier of irrigation and nursery products with branches located primarily in the Southeastern United States. Subsequent acquisitions under Deere’s ownership included Century Rain Aid in 2001, United Green Mark in 2005 and LESCO Inc. (“LESCO”) in 2007, each of which significantly expanded our geographic footprint and broadened our product portfolio.
Holdings indirectly owns 100% of the membership interest in SiteOne Landscape Supply Holding, LLC (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “Landscape Holding”). Landscape Holding is the parent and sole owner of SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as “Landscape”). Prior to the CD&R Acquisition described below, Deere was the sole owner of Landscape Holding.
On December 23, 2013 (the “Closing Date”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings acquired 100% of the ownership interest in Landscape Holding from Deere in exchange for common shares of Holdings representing 40% of Holdings’ then outstanding capital stock (assuming conversion of the cumulative convertible participating redeemable preferred stock, or the “Preferred Stock”) plus cash consideration of approximately $314 million, net of pre-closing and post-closing adjustments. Holdings also issued 174,000 shares of Preferred Stock to CD&R Landscapes Holdings, L.P. (the “CD&R Investor”), an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”), representing 60% of the then outstanding capital stock of Holdings (on an as-converted basis). As part of the transaction, Landscape Holding also acquired from Deere the affiliated company LESCO. We refer to the transactions described in this paragraph as the “CD&R Acquisition.”
On May 17, 2016, we completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock at a price to the public of $21.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, the CD&R Investor and Deere together sold an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of common stock. The underwriters also exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock from the CD&R Investor and Deere, at the public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The CD&R Investor and Deere received all of the net proceeds and bore all commissions and discounts from the sale of our common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the IPO. On the day prior to the closing of the IPO, all of our then-outstanding Preferred Stock converted into shares of common stock, resulting in the issuance by us of an additional 25,303,164 shares of our common stock. The conversion of Preferred Stock is accounted for from the date of conversion and is not retroactively adjusted in our financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Holdings registered on behalf of certain stockholders the offering and sale of 9,000,000 shares of common stock, as well as 1,350,000 shares of common stock sold to the underwriters pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares. On December 5, 2016, the selling stockholders completed the offering of 10,350,000 shares of common stock at a price of $33.00 per share. Holdings did not receive any of the proceeds from the aggregate 10,350,000 shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders.
As of March 10, 2017, the CD&R Investor and Deere hold approximately 27.9% and 14.9% of Holdings’ common stock, respectively. 
Following the CD&R Acquisition, we have revitalized our acquisition strategy and have acquired 16 businesses as of March 10, 2017. The historical annual net sales of these businesses prior to their respective acquisition dates totaled more than $450 million.

Our Products and Services
Our ability to provide a broad range of products is essential to our success. We believe we offer the industry’s most comprehensive portfolio of landscape products with over 100,000 SKUs from more than 2,500 suppliers. Our product portfolio includes irrigation, fertilizer & other, control products, landscape accessories, nursery goods, hardscapes and outdoor lighting products. In each of the 2016, 2015 and 2014 Fiscal Years, sales of irrigation, fertilizer & other and control products each accounted for 10% or more of our net sales. In addition, sales of nursery goods accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in the 2016 and 2015 Fiscal Years. Landscape accessories accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in the 2016 and 2014 Fiscal Years.
Our customers value our product breadth and geographic reach, as well as our on-site expertise and consultative services. While pricing is important to our customers, availability, convenience and expertise are also important factors in their purchase decisions. In addition to other capabilities, our ability to offer the significant yard space and special equipment that items such as nursery goods and hardscapes require provides us with a competitive advantage over many competitors who offer a more limited selection of product categories. 
See Note 12 to our audited financial statements for more information on our net sales in the agronomic (fertilizer & other and control products), irrigation and outdoor lighting, landscape accessories and hardscapes and nursery goods categories.
Irrigation
Our irrigation products include controllers, valves, sprinkler heads and irrigation and drainage pipes. The market for irrigation products has historically provided stable growth and is driven primarily by new home construction and maintenance of existing irrigation systems. We believe water conservation regulations and rising consumer interest in more complex decorative and functional landscaping will continue to drive demand for upgraded irrigation systems.
Fertilizer & Other
Our fertilizer & other products include fertilizer, grass seed and ice melt products. Fertilizer products are sold to the maintenance end market and accordingly are relatively stable through economic cycles.
10

Control Products
Our control products are specialty products that include herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides and other pesticides. Similar to fertilizer products, control products sales are strongly tied to the maintenance end market and accordingly are relatively stable through economic cycles. We expect that future growth for control products will be aided by the introduction of new bio-pesticides derived from natural materials.
Landscape Accessories
Our landscape accessories products include mulches, soil amendments, tools and sod. Landscape accessories are typically sold in combination with other landscape supply products. As a result, sales of these accessories are often tied to sales fertilizers and control products, as well as sales of nursery goods and hardscape products.
Nursery Goods
Our nursery goods include deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs and trees, ornamental trees, shade trees, both field grown and container-grown nursery stock and hundreds of plant species and cultivars available in a number of heights and bloom colors. We believe increased demand for nursery goods will be driven by the rising interest in outdoor living spaces, including patios, outdoor kitchens, open-air living rooms and decks that extend the living space to the outdoors. We also believe the nursery goods category represents a growth opportunity due to its size and our relatively low penetration of the market to date.
Outdoor Lighting
Our outdoor lighting products include accent lights, dark lights, path lights, up lights, down lights, wall lights and pool and aquatic area lighting. Outdoor lighting products are expected to grow at an estimated 8.1% through 2019, according to Freedonia, due in part to growing trends in outdoor living and an interest in improving the exterior appearance of homes. In addition, the recent shift from AC to low voltage DC power sources and advances in LED technology are expected to contribute to additional demand for outdoor lighting products.
Hardscapes
Hardscapes include paving stones, blocks and other durable materials. According to Freedonia, the hardscape market is expected to grow at an estimated CAGR of 7.3% through 2019. We believe that this trend, combined with our relatively low market share in hardscapes, provides us with a significant growth opportunity.
Proprietary Branded Products
In addition to distributing branded products of third parties, we offer products under our proprietary brands. Sales of LESCO and Green Tech together accounted for approximately 19% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales, the large majority of which is attributable to LESCO.
LESCO
We acquired LESCO and its associated brands in 2007. LESCO is a premium brand and maintains strong brand awareness with golf and professional landscape contractors.
Under the LESCO brand, we offer formulations of fertilizer (liquid and granular), combination products (pesticides on a fertilizer carrier), control products (liquid and granular pesticides), specialty chemicals, turf seed, application equipment (engine powered and walk behind or other non-engine powered), paint, maintenance products like engine oil, windshield washer fluid, ice melt, trimmer line and soil tests. In 2015, we introduced Basic Seed and Basic Nutrition, “sub-brands” of LESCO, under which we offer fertilizer and landscape accessories. LESCO products are sold through our branches and retail outlets such as The Home Depot and Ace Hardware.
 
11

Green Tech
We offer pre-packaged landscape and irrigation management solutions that are designed to help customers manage and conserve water under the Green Tech brand. The core Green Tech product lines include central irrigation control systems, solar assemblies, fertilizer injection systems, irrigation pumps and hand-held remote control equipment.
Services
We offer a variety of complementary, value-added services to support the sale of our products. We do not derive separate revenue for these services, but we believe they are an important differentiator in establishing our value proposition to our customers.
Product Knowledge and Technical Expertise
Consultative services provided by our local staff, many of whom are former landscape contractors or golf course superintendents, include product selection and support, assistance with design and implementation of landscape projects and potential sales leads for new business opportunities. Our SiteOne University program provides customers with access to substantive training and informational seminars that directly support the growth of their businesses. The program includes technical training, licensing, certifications and business management seminars. In addition, our product category experts provide technical knowledge on the features and benefits of products we provide as well as on job installation techniques.
Project Services
We partner with our customers by providing consultative services to help them save time, money and effort in bidding for new projects and for new landscape installations. Our regionally based project services teams specialize in quoting, estimating and completing sales for customers who compete in the commercial construction sector. Other services provided by our project services teams include specifications assistance and irrigation design.
Partners Program
We also offer a loyalty program, our Partners Program, which had more than 12,000 enrolled customers as of January 1, 2017 and provides business and personal rewards, access to business services at preferred rates and technical training and support. Reward points may be spent, for example, on credit on account, trips and special events, gift cards to major retailers and SiteOne University courses and educational events. Access to preferred rate business services includes, for example, payroll and select human resources services, cell phone services, office supplies, auto and fleet insurance and fuel rebates. For the 2016 Fiscal Year, Partners Program participants accounted for approximately 48% of our net sales.
Operational Structure
Our operational philosophy is to create local area teams and branch networks specifically designed to best meet our customers’ needs at the local market level, while supporting these teams with the resources of a large company delivered through regional and divisional management, including company-wide corporate functions.
At the local market level, we organize our 469 branches and approximately 358 outside sales representatives into 50 designated “areas” that each serve a defined geography, typically a large MSA or a combination of MSAs in close proximity. Area managers are responsible for organization and talent planning, branch operations, sales strategy and product delivery strategy. Area managers are supported by an area business manager responsible for executing the local market strategies and key initiatives to grow sales and profitability. Branch managers report to the area business manager, while outside sales representatives report to the area manager directly.
We support our 469 branches and 50 areas with regional management and company-wide corporate functions providing: management of business performance; development and execution of local strategies; sharing of best practices; execution and integration of acquisitions; finance and accounting expertise (credit/collections, payables); category management and procurement; supply chain (planners, buyers); pricing strategies; marketing; and information technology. All of our branches are integrated on a single technology platform, allowing us to leverage our full operational scale for procurement, inventory management, financial support, data analytics and performance reporting.

Sales
We are the largest and only national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies in the United States, and we have a growing presence in Canada. We have an extensive North American platform of 469 branch locations in 45 states and five provinces. Approximately 99% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales were within the United States. 
Our approximately 2,900 field associates including, 358 outside sales representatives, have regular interaction with our customers due to the recurring nature of landscape services and the fact that most contractors tend to buy products on an as-needed basis. We rely heavily on local teams for sales, marketing and strategy execution, with our strategic marketing initiatives supported by company-wide customer analytics and programs in order to drive acquisition and retention of customers. Our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty and drives repeat business with our customers.
Our outside sales force is organized by geographic area and specialty. Each area maintains a number of outside sales representatives who drive sales growth on behalf of several branches across a variety of accounts from landscape contractors to municipal agencies. We also maintain a sales force of agronomic sales representatives who are focused on growing sales to the golf industry.
We have a national account sales organization which leads sales strategy and execution for our largest national and regional customers. The national sales team is organized around five different market sectors: landscape and grounds maintenance, golf, retail, international and engineering, procurement and construction. Each national account manager is responsible for a group of large accounts and coordinates our business with them both nationally and locally through our local sales representatives. National account managers negotiate national programs with our largest customers in order to increase our share of their business.

Pricing
Our pricing strategy is developed nationally and deployed locally with input from regional and area managers to adjust for market-specific conditions. Depending upon the local competitive dynamics, pricing can be tailored to the region, market or customer level as needed. Our pricing team monitors market supply and demand trends that impact our supplier community and customer base and is able to adjust pricing based upon those trends in order to remain competitive.
Category Management
Our category management initiatives are developed at the national level, with input from local and regional level management. We track product demand, market size and share and we use this information to improve our product mix and select appropriate suppliers. We believe these initiatives enable us to provide improved service to customers and drive supply chain efficiencies, leading to increased market share and margin growth. We have a dedicated team for each category, which enables us to build specific category strategies that are nationally based but can be, through a series of menu options, tailored to support a specific region or area.
Marketing
Our marketing department is integral to our strategy and helps drive the business through brand management, print marketing, including catalogs and promotional fliers, and digital marketing, which includes search engine optimization and website development. Our marketing department is also responsible for customer management and is focused on developing ways to successfully acquire, retain and reactivate customers. We also focus on branch merchandising by evaluating our customers’ buying patterns and seeking opportunities to showcase products that we believe will attract customer interest and help promote our “one-stop shop” capabilities.
Distribution Network
We use two distribution models to offer a comprehensive selection of products and meet the needs of each local market.
Branches
Our branch network is the core of our operations and creates a highly valuable connection between our suppliers and our customers.  Of our approximately 2,700 suppliers, few are set up to serve the shipping needs of our customers as their supply chains are typically focused on bulk quantities shipped from only a few locations. In contrast, many of our customers often require comparatively small quantities of products from numerous suppliers to complete a typical project, making it unfeasible to source directly from those suppliers.  Our branch network provides significant value to our suppliers by maintaining local availability of core and complementary products in quantities our customers need.
The majority of our branches carry multiple product categories but do not carry all of them. Branches that carry our full product lines combine our regular branch facilities with large 8-to-15 acre yards suitable for nursery goods and hardscape products. Yards are well-equipped to manage truckload-purchased landscape, nursery and hardscape products and can maintain a diverse variety of greenhouse and nursery plants. All locations offering nursery goods have water distribution systems to maintain inventories, and many of these locations have access to municipal water supply, wells or ponds.  Branches are strategically located near residential areas with good highway access. In-store merchandising displays are utilized to emphasize product features and seasonal promotions. We primarily lease 5,000 to 15,000 square foot facilities in both freestanding and multi-tenant buildings, with secured outside storage yards averaging from 10,000 to 20,000 square feet in some branches.  
Direct Distribution
Our direct distribution business provides point-to-point logistics for bulk quantities of landscape products between producers and customers. Our direct distribution business provides customers with sourcing and logistics support services for inventory management and delivery, in many cases more economically than the producers might otherwise provide. We believe that producers view us not as competitors, but as providers of a valuable service, brokering these large orders through the use of our network. We typically do not maintain inventory for direct distribution but rather use our existing producer relationships, marketing expertise and ordering and logistics infrastructure to serve this demand, requiring less working capital investment for these sales. Approximately 7% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales were from direct distribution.
Direct distribution is preferred for contractors with large projects, typically designed by professional landscape architects. Contractors work hand-in-hand with our outside sales and inside sales teams, including project planning support with material take-offs, product sourcing and bid preparation. Using our large vendor network, our associates arrange convenient direct shipments to jobs, coordinated and staged according to each phase of construction. This distribution channel primarily handles bulk nursery, agronomic, landscape and hardscape products.
14

Construction Sectors
We supply products primarily to contractors in the residential, commercial and recreational & other construction sectors. Approximately 54% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales derived from the residential sector, 31% from the commercial sector and 15% from the recreational & other construction sector.
Residential
Our residential sector includes installation work (e.g., irrigation systems, nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes, etc.) for new single-family and multi-family housing as well as repair, upgrade and maintenance activities for existing homes. Demand in our residential sector is primarily influenced by general economic conditions, population growth, employment levels, mortgage rates and consumer spending. Many of the customers we serve in this sector are small, local landscape service companies and installers.
Commercial
Our commercial sector includes products for landscape installation, repair, upgrade and maintenance for non-residential buildings, such as office space, hotels, retail centers, manufacturing plants, warehouses, schools, hospitals and government facilities. The key drivers for this sector are general levels of economic activity, vacancy rates and government spending. Customers in this sector include small, private landscape contractors as well as larger, more regionally-focused landscape firms.
Recreational & Other
Our recreational sector consists primarily of the sale of agronomic products to golf courses. We also include within this sector our sales to other recreational facilities, such as parks, athletic fields and outdoor resorts; sales to infrastructure-related projects for state and municipal governments; and sales to other customers unrelated to residential or commercial construction. Key drivers of this sector are consumer confidence, levels of recreational activity and government spending. A large proportion of the customers in this sector are facility operators who buy directly from us instead of using an intermediary landscape contractor.
End Markets
Our sales can be broken down into three separate end markets: (1) landscape maintenance, (2) the installation of landscape materials for new construction and (3) the repair and upgrade of existing landscaping. These categories accounted for 43%, 39% and 18%, respectively, of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales.
Maintenance
We sell a variety of items that are designed to maintain the health of existing landscaping, such as fertilizers and control products, pesticides and herbicides. Ice melt is also a significant maintenance product that is used to maintain walkways and driveways during cold weather periods. Our maintenance sales tend to be more stable through economic cycles than our sales for either the new construction or repair and upgrade end markets.
New Construction
We sell a variety of products that are frequently installed during the construction of new single-family or multi-family residences. These items typically include irrigation systems, nursery goods, outdoor lighting and hardscapes. These products are also frequently installed by our customers during the construction of non-residential buildings, such as commercial office space and retail centers, though often on a much larger scale. Our sales and service associates have significant expertise and tools available to assist customers with the planning and design of new landscape installations, including irrigation networks, which positively differentiates us from competitors and creates substantial value for our customers.
Repair and Upgrade
Similar to new construction, repair and upgrade of existing landscaping is common and can be triggered by a number of potential factors and events, including changing consumer preferences, home prices, environmental regulations, weather damage, product obsolescence and technological improvements. In particular, a recent or pending sale of a home has been cited as a key driver of residential repair and upgrade activity. The same types of products we sell for new construction are generally sold to our customers for repair and upgrade projects.
15

Customers
Our customers are primarily residential and commercial landscape professionals who specialize in the design, installation and maintenance of lawns, gardens, golf courses and other outdoor spaces. Our customer base consists of more than 180,000 firms and individuals, with our top 10 customers accounting for approximately 4% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales, with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of net sales. Small customers, with annual purchases of up to $10,000, made up 18% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales. Medium customers, with annual purchases between $10,000 and $200,000, made up 54% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales. Large customers, with annual purchases over $200,000, made up 27% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales. Some of our largest customers include BrightView, The Home Depot, Davey Tree Expert Company and TruGreen. Distribution of our LESCO proprietary branded products on a wholesale basis to retailers represented approximately 1% of our 2016 Fiscal Year net sales.
Suppliers
Our market leadership, coast-to-coast market presence, broad product selection and extensive technical expertise have allowed us to develop strong relationships with our suppliers. Our size and broad national network make us an attractive partner for many industry-leading manufacturers, which has allowed us to maintain strong, long-term relationships with our supply base. Our scale advantages also lead to larger volume-based rebates, and we believe we are generally able to negotiate more favorable purchasing terms than many of our smaller competitors in the industry.
We source our products from more than 2,500 suppliers, including the major irrigation equipment manufacturers, turf and ornamental fertilizer/chemical companies, and a variety of suppliers who specialize in nursery goods, outdoor lighting, hardscapes and other landscape products. Some of our largest suppliers include Hunter, Rain Bird, Toro, Oldcastle, Bayer, Syngenta, BASF, Dow AgroSciences, Vista and NDS. Purchases from our top 10 suppliers accounted for approximately 33% of total purchases for our 2016 Fiscal Year. 
We generally procure our products through purchase orders rather than under long-term contracts with firm commitments. We work to develop strong relationships with a select group of suppliers that we target based on a number of factors, including brand and market recognition, price, quality, product support and service, service levels, delivery terms and their strategic positioning. We generally have annual supplier agreements, and while they generally do not provide for specific product pricing, many include volume-based financial incentives that we earn by meeting or exceeding target purchase volumes. Our ability to earn these volume-based incentives is an important factor in our financial results. In limited cases, we have entered into supply contracts with terms that exceed one year for the manufacture of our LESCO branded fertilizer and some nursery goods and grass seed, which may require us to purchase products in the future.
Competition
The majority of our competition comes from other wholesale landscape supply distributors. Among wholesale distributors, we primarily compete against a small number of regional distributors and many small, local, privately-owned distributors. Some of our competitors carry several product categories, while others mainly focus on one product category such as irrigation, fertilizer/control, nursery goods or hardscapes. SiteOne is one of the only wholesale distributors which carries the full line of irrigation, fertilizer & other, control products, landscape accessories, nursery goods, hardscapes and outdoor lighting products.
We believe our top nine largest competitors include Ewing, Harrell’s, Horizon Distributors (a subsidiary of Pool Corporation), Imperial Sprinkler Supply, Central Turf & Irrigation Supply, Atlantic Irrigation, Reinders, FIS Outdoor and Longhorn.
16

We believe smaller, regional or local competitors still comprise approximately 82% of the landscape supply industry based on 2016 net sales. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, location, availability of materials and supplies, technical product knowledge and expertise, advisory or other service capabilities, delivery capabilities, pricing of products and availability of credit.
Associates
As of March 10, 2017, we had approximately 3,300 associates, none of whom were affiliated with labor unions. We believe that we have good relations with our associates. Additionally, we believe that the training provided through our development programs and our entrepreneurial, performance-based culture provides significant benefits to our associates. Approximately 95% of our associates are employed on a full-time, year-round basis. Our associate count currently includes approximately 165 seasonal associates, who are temporarily employed due to the weather-dependent nature of our business. An associate is anyone employed by the Company.
Our Brand
We transitioned from using variations on the Deere name and logo to using the SiteOne brand name as of December 31, 2015. We believe the SiteOne name highlights the benefits of our “one-stop shop” business model, whereby professional landscape contractors can fulfill their landscape product needs in one place.
We believe that our strong customer and supplier relationships have led to the rapid acceptance of our new brand that supports our mission of providing top quality services and products to our customers.
Service Marks, Trademarks and Trade Names
We hold various trademark registrations, including SiteOne and LESCO, which we consider important to our marketing activities. Generally, trademark rights have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain these trademark registrations and the other trademarks associated with our business so long as they remain valuable to our business. In addition, other than commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses for third-party intellectual property are material to our business, taken as a whole.
Weather Conditions and Seasonality
In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, our net sales and net income have been higher in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these quarters. Our net sales have been significantly lower in the first and fourth quarters due to lower landscaping, irrigation and turf maintenance activities in these quarters, and we have historically incurred net losses in these quarters. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as snow or rain, which can not only impact the demand for certain products like fertilizer and ice melt but also delay construction projects where our products are used.
Regulatory Compliance
Government Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the products and services we provide or the methods by which we offer and sell those products and services or conduct our business and subjects us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
These federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection, wage and hour, deceptive trade practices, permitting and licensing, state contractor laws, workers’ safety, tax, healthcare reforms, collective bargaining and other labor matters, environmental and employee benefits.
In 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the majority of the provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Act”). The Act places requirements on employers to provide a minimum level of benefits to employees and assesses penalties on employers if the benefits do not meet the required minimum level or if the cost of coverage to employees exceeds affordability thresholds specified in the Act. The minimum benefits and affordability requirements took effect in 2014. The Act also imposes an excise tax beginning in 2018 on plans whose average cost exceeds specified amounts. We have analyzed the effects on us from the provisions of the Act and we do not currently anticipate a significant financial impact.
17

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to numerous federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws that regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, handling, treatment, storage, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our associates and users of our products and impose liability for investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances at sites we have ever owned, leased or operated or used as a disposal site.
In the United States, we are regulated under many environmental, health and safety laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, each as amended. Certain laws, such as those requiring the registration of herbicides and pesticides, and regulating their use, also involve the oversight of regulatory authorities and public health agencies. Although we strive to comply with such laws and have processes in place designed to achieve compliance, we may be unable to prevent violations of these or other laws from occurring. We could also incur significant investigation and clean-up costs for contamination at any currently or formerly owned or operated facilities, including LESCO’s manufacturing and blending facilities. See “Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies” to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Annual Report. 
In addition, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental, health or safety laws on our operations. Changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, including obligations with respect to any potential health hazards of our products, may lead to additional compliance or other costs.
