Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We are one of the pioneer companies in developing the electric hydraulic fracturing industry. We are based in Houston, Texas and provide our services to oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies in the United States. We are one of the first companies to develop and commercially deploy electric-powered hydraulic fracturing technology (“Clean Fleet®”), which we believe is an industry-changing technology. Our Clean Fleet® technology has a demonstrated track record for successful commercial operation, with over 18,750 electric frac stages completed since the first Clean Fleet® was deployed in July 2014. Our Clean Fleet® technology is supported by a robust intellectual property portfolio, consisting of 38 granted patents and an additional 189 pending patents. We believe that the following characteristics of the Clean Fleet® technology provide the Company with a distinct competitive advantage:
 
 
• | Industry Leading Environmental Profile
--+---------------------------------------


• | Reduced Fuel Costs
--+-------------------


• | Enhanced Wellsite and Community Safety Profile
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Lower Cost of Ownership
--+------------------------


• | Superior Operational Efficiency Profile
--+----------------------------------------

 
Currently, we provide our services in the Appalachian Basin, the Eagle Ford, and the Permian Basin. We have demonstrated the capability to expeditiously deploy our fleets to new oil and gas basins when requested by customers. Our customers include Apache Corporation, Marathon Oil, Range Resources, Shell, BP, and other leading E&P companies.
 
Company Formation
 
On February 21, 2012, U.S. Well Services, LLC (“USWS LLC”) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company and subsequently grew organically from one diesel powered hydraulic fracturing fleet (“Conventional Fleets”) in April 2012 to 14 available fleets representing 684,545 hydraulic horsepower (“HHP”); five of which utilize our patented electric-powered hydraulic fracturing technology (the “Clean Fleet®”). 
 
As part of a corporate restructuring in February 2017, all of the outstanding equity interest of USWS LLC was acquired by a newly formed entity, USWS Holdings, LLC (“USWS Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company that was formed for the purposes of effecting the corporate restructuring and that had no operations of its own. USWS Holdings was acquired by U.S. Well Services, Inc. (f/k/a Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation, or “MPAC”) on November 9, 2018, as discussed further under Business Combination herein. 
 
Business Combination
 
On March 10, 2016, MPAC was incorporated in Delaware as a special purpose acquisition company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. On March 15, 2017, MPAC consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”), following which its shares began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”).
 
On November 9, 2018, MPAC acquired USWS Holdings (the “Transaction”) pursuant to a Merger and Contribution Agreement, dated as of July 13, 2018 (as amended, the “Merger and Contribution Agreement”). The Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, USWS Holdings is treated as the acquirer and MPAC is treated as the acquired party.
 
In connection with the closing of the Transaction, MPAC changed its name to U.S. Well Services, Inc. (“USWS Inc.”) and its trading symbols on Nasdaq from “MPAC,” and “MPACW,” to “USWS” and “USWSW”. 
 
Pursuant to the Merger and Contribution Agreement, on November 9, 2018, USWS Inc. issued Class A common stock to certain members of USWS Holdings in exchange for their interests in USWS Holdings and Class B common stock to certain 
 6


members of USWS Holdings who retained their interests in USWS Holdings.  
 
Following the completion of the Transaction, the Company was organized as an “Up-C” structure, meaning that substantially all the Company’s assets and operations are held and conducted by USWS LLC. The Company’s only assets are equity interests representing 97% ownership of USWS Holdings as of December 31, 2020. The Transaction did not include a tax receivable agreement.
 Organizational Structure
 The following diagram illustrates the ownership structure of the Company as of December 31, 2020: 
 
Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights in USWS Inc. but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by shareholders generally. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law. We do not intend to list the Class B common stock on any exchange.
 
Under the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of USWS Holdings, each share of Class B common stock of USWS Inc., together with one unit of USWS Holdings and subject to certain limitations, is exchangeable (the "Exchange Right") for one share of Class A common stock of USWS Inc. or, at the Company's election, the cash equivalent to the market value of one share of Class A common stock of USWS Inc. The exchange is subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications, and other similar transactions. In addition, upon a change in control of USWS Inc., USWS Inc. has the right to require each holder of USWS Holdings units (other than USWS Inc.) to exercise its Exchange Right with respect to some or all of such holder's USWS Holdings units. An exchange of Class B common stock of USWS Inc., together with the corresponding one unit of USWS Holdings, will result in both being cancelled.
 
Operations 
 
Our operations are organized into a single business segment, which consists of hydraulic fracturing services, and we have one reportable geographical business segment, the United States.

Services
 
We provide hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies. Hydraulic fracturing services are performed to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability and restricted flow of hydrocarbons. Our customers benefit from our expertise in fracturing of horizontal and vertical oil and natural gas-producing wells in shale and other unconventional geological formations.
 
The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a pressurized stream of fracturing fluid — typically a mixture of water, chemicals, and proppant — into a well casing or tubing to cause the underground mineral formation to fracture or crack. Fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and provide a conductive channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely to the wellbore for collection. The propping agent, or proppant, becomes lodged in the cracks created by the hydraulic fracturing process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the well. 
 
Our fleets consist of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform fracturing services. We have two designs for our hydraulic fracturing units: (1) Our legacy conventional fleets, which are powered by diesel fuel and utilize traditional internal combustion engines, transmissions, and radiators and (2) our next-generation Clean Fleet® technology, which replaces the traditional engines, transmissions, and radiators with electric motors powered by electricity created by turbine generators. Both designs utilize high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps mounted on trailers. We refer to the group of pump trailers and other equipment necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a “fleet,” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.”
 
Our Clean Fleet® equipment also allows us to pursue business opportunities outside of the upstream oil and gas sector. We offer power generation services, leasing turbine generators and ancillary power generation equipment under short or long-term arrangements, along with skilled personnel, to provide peaking power and other power generation needs to customers in a variety of industries and markets. Although this has not been a material source of revenue for us historically, we believe that power generation services represent an attractive avenue for future growth. 
 Clean Fleet® Technology
 
Our Clean Fleet® combines natural gas turbine generators with electric motors and existing industry equipment to provide fracturing services with numerous advantages over conventional fleets. Our Clean Fleet® technology is a proven technology that has been in commercial operations since July 2014, making us a leading provider of electric-powered hydraulic fracturing services. Our Clean Fleet® technology is supported by a robust intellectual property portfolio. We have been granted, or have received notice of allowance, for 38 patents and have an additional 189 patents pending.
We believe Clean Fleet® technology provides the Company with a distinct competitive advantage over our competitors because of the following characteristics:
 
 
• | Industry Leading Environmental Profile – Clean Fleet® technology offers superior emissions performance as compared to traditional diesel-powered hydraulic fracturing equipment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced Fuel Costs – Clean Fleet® technology uses electric motors to drive its frac pumps instead of internal combustion engines and transmissions used on traditional, diesel-powered fracturing equipment. Clean Fleet®’s electric motors are powered by mobile turbine generators that can use natural gas produced and conditioned in the field (“Field Gas”), compressed natural gas (“CNG”), liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) or diesel as a fuel source. Our customers typically provide Field Gas or CNG to fuel Clean Fleet®’s turbine generators, which offers a significant cost savings relative to purchasing diesel fuel to power traditional fracturing equipment in the current market environment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Wellsite and Community Safety Profile – Clean Fleet® offers superior safety benefits relative to traditional diesel-powered fracturing fleets for both workers at the wellsite and inhabitants of nearby communities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower Cost of Ownership – We believe Clean Fleet® offers the best cost of ownership of any commercially available hydraulic fracturing technology. Also, Clean Fleet® uses long-lived components such as electric motors, switchgears, and turbine generators that we estimate will be capable of operating for more than 15 years, while traditional diesel-
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

powered fracturing fleets can be expected to operate for less than five years before requiring major component replacements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Superior Operational Efficiency Profile – Clean Fleet® technology allows us to garner operational efficiencies that are difficult to achieve with traditional diesel-powered fracturing technology. By eliminating moving parts associated with internal combustion engines and transmissions, as well as eliminating the need for preventative maintenance activities such as oil filter changes, we are able to reduce maintenance-related downtime. Additionally, the ability of our Clean Fleet® technology to automatically capture and transmit vast amounts of operational, logistical, and environmental data provide us with insights that offer opportunities for continuous improvements in our operational efficiencies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that the following strengths will position us to provide high-quality service to our customers and create value for our stockholders:
 
 
• | Proprietary Clean Fleet® technology. We are a market leader in electric fracturing technology, with five all-electric hydraulic fracturing fleets. Our fleets utilizing Clean Fleet® technology provide substantial cost savings by replacing diesel fuel with natural gas and offer considerable operational, safety and environmental advantages. Clean Fleet® technology offers superior operational efficiency resulting from reduced non-productive time due to repairs, maintenance and failures associated with diesel-powered engines and transmissions. Additionally, Clean Fleet® technology can substantially reduce emissions of air pollutants and noise from the wellsite. With an increasing focus on ESG and increasing returns by our customers, we believe that adoption of this technology in the near term will materially increase and allow us to continue to significantly expand our market share over the next several years.

• | Track record for safety. Safety is a critical element of our operations. We focus on providing customers with the highest quality of service by employing a trained and motivated workforce that is rigorously focused on safety. We continuously review safety data and work to develop and implement policies and procedures that ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate. Our field operators are empowered to stop work and question the safety of a situation or task performed. We use specialized technology to improve safety for our truck drivers and employ measures to mitigate the risk of respirable silica dust exposure on the wellsite. We believe our record of safe operations makes us an attractive partner for both our customers and our employees. Additionally, we have taken proactive measures to safeguard the physical health of our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Employees capable of working from home were mandated to do so until conditions improve making it safe for their return on a voluntary basis, and all individuals entering a Company facility or work location are required to undergo a screening process.

Customer Concentration
 
Our customers include a broad range of leading E&P companies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Apache Corporation, Shell, Marathon, Range, and EQT each comprised greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues.
Suppliers
 
We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers from which we procure major equipment components used to maintain, build, or upgrade our custom Clean Fleet® hydraulic fracturing equipment. In addition, some of these components have few suppliers and long lead times to acquire. Historically, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or equipment by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Competition
 
The markets in which we operate are very competitive. We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States, and our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers, including some of the largest integrated service companies. Our hydraulic fracturing services compete with large, integrated companies such as Halliburton Company and Schlumberger Limited as well as other companies including Evolution Well Services, Calfrac Well Services Ltd., FTS International Inc., Liberty Oilfield Services Inc., NexTier Oilfield Solutions Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., ProPetro Services Inc., and RPC Inc. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented, and we compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers. Although several of our larger competitors have announced their intention to develop or adopt new electric hydraulic fracturing technologies, we believe that only U.S. Well Services, Inc. and one privately owned competitor are currently offering all-electric hydraulic fracturing services.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, workforce competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience, and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. 
 
Cyclical Nature of Industry
 
We operate in a cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of well completions by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies like us. Increased E&P capital expenditures ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices which in turn tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons 
 10


of results across periods.
 
Insurance
 
Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of their applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Numerous federal, state, and local governmental agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that could carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in permit revocations or modifications, operational disruptions, or injunctive obligations for noncompliance. These laws and regulations may, for example, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically-sensitive areas and other protected areas, or require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof that result in more stringent and costly requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.
 
Below is an overview of some of the more significant environmental, health and safety requirements with which we must comply. Our customers’ operations are subject to similar laws and regulations. Any material adverse effect of these laws and regulations on our customers’ operations and financial position may also have an indirect material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
 
Waste Handling. We handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws and regulations, which impose requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with our own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of nonhazardous waste provisions.
 
Administrative, civil, and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or re-categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production wastes as hazardous. Any such changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
 
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment or, under some state CERCLA-analogous laws, the release of solid waste. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the substance at the facility, and transporters who selected the disposal site. 
 11


Liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes or contamination, damages to natural resources, and the costs of conducting certain health studies, amongst other things, is strict and joint and several. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. During our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state laws. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such substances have been released.
 
NORM. During our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and gas deposits and accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.
Water Discharges. The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), or the applicable state. The Clean Water Act has been interpreted by these agencies to apply broadly. The EPA and the Corps released a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, for all Clean Water Act programs, which went into effect in August 2015. Litigation and political maneuverings surrounding the revised WOTUS definition have been ongoing since that time. On October 22, 2019, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule and re-codify the regulatory text that existed prior to 2015 (the “Step One Rule”). The Step One Rule became effective on December 23, 2019. On January 23, 2020, the EPA and the Corps announced the final Navigable Waters Protection Rule (the “NWPR”), which revised and narrowed the WOTUS definition. The NWPR replaced the Step One Rule and became effective on June 22, 2020. The Biden administration will conduct a review of the NWPR, and we expect political maneuverings and litigation regarding the WOTUS definition to continue, creating uncertainty as to what constitutes a protected “water of the United States.” In addition, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters.
Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other emissions control requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants from specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs to remain in compliance. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate, and significant administrative, civil, and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with air regulations. Obtaining or renewing permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
Climate Change. The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because such gases contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented, and continues to adopt and implement, regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain large sources of GHG emissions in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities. The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs and through the establishment of emissions reduction targets. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. The United States exited the Paris Agreement in November 2020, but rejoined it effective on February 19, 2021. Additional federal and/or state regulations targeting climate change could significantly affect our operations or compliance costs.
 
Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme 
 12


weather may not be fully insured.
 
Endangered and Threatened Species. Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws may impact exploration, development, and production activities in areas where we operate. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and various state analogs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, or a state may impose new rules limiting oil and gas operations to protect wildlife or habitat, which could cause us or our customers to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or operating bans in the affected areas.
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, on January 20, 2021, the Biden administration issued an order implementing a 60-day suspension on new oil and gas leases and drilling permits for federal lands and water. On January 27, 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order that indefinitely pauses new oil and gas leases on federal lands while the administration undertakes a comprehensive review on climate change impacts. Additionally, beginning in August 2012, the EPA issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and associated equipment. Various political maneuverings resulted in September 2020 amendments to New Source Performance Standards issued in 2016. These amendments rescinded certain methane control requirements and removed the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and were promptly challenged in court, resulting in a temporary stay issued by the D.C. Circuit. The amendments are currently under review by the Biden Administration, which could further revise or rescind them. The U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and natural gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. The BLM adopted final rules in January 2017. Operators generally had one year from the January 2017 effective date to come into compliance with the rule’s requirements. In December 2017, the BLM temporarily suspended or delayed certain of these requirements set forth in its Venting and Flaring Rule until January 2019, and in September 2018, the BLM published a final rule which scaled back the waste-prevention requirements of the 2016 rule. Both the 2016 rule and the September 2018 revision of that rule were vacated in 2020 court decisions.  Litigation and administrative review of these rules remain ongoing. Moreover, in March 2015, the BLM issued a final rule that imposes requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. However, the BLM rescinded this rule in December 2017. In January 2018, California and a coalition of environmental groups filed suit in the Northern District of California to challenge the BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule. In March 2020, the California district court upheld the BLM’s rescission of the hydraulic fracturing rule, and the plaintiff groups appealed. This litigation and administrative review of federal hydraulic fracturing regulations is ongoing.  Many states also have hydraulic fracturing regulations in place that may be duplicative of the rescinded federal regulations, and the BLM requires operators to comply with the law of the state where the federal or Indian land is located.
 
Further, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, restrict, or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. 
 
Federal and state governments have also begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead the federal government 
 13


and has led some state governments to develop and implement additional regulations, including stricter regulatory requirements relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells or requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise.
 
Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities (whether as a result of the EPA study results or resulting from other factors) could restrict our ability to operate in certain areas or subject us and our customers to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and plugging and abandonment requirements. New requirements could result in increased operational costs for us and our customers and reduce the demand for our services.
 
OSHA Matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and the public.
 Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 638 full-time employees and no part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We believe our relationships with our employees are excellent. From time to time, we will utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and/or other services.
Intellectual Property
 
We have been granted or have received notice of allowance for 38 patents, which begin to expire in late 2033, and have an additional 189 patents pending. Our patents protect our Clean Fleet® technology from being duplicated by competitors. These patents help provide unique competitive advantages in operating areas where noise and emissions are key concerns. We also use proprietary FRAC MD® technology to support our preventative maintenance program and prolong equipment useful life. This technology utilizes specialized equipment to capture and analyze vibrations to identify component stress so maintenance can be performed prior to catastrophic failures. Our fleets continuously transmit data captured in the field to our IoT platform. This data is analyzed by our team of data scientists in order improve our operations by garnering insights that inform real-time decision making in the field and drive our machine learning capabilities to increase efficiency and extend equipment useful life.
