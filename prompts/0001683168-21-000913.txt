ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
Prior to the acquisition of our wholly-owned subsidiary as described below, our main business consisted of the manufacture and sale of a Breath Alcohol Ignition Interlock Device (BAIID) we developed known as the BDI-747 Ignition Interlock Device (the “BDI-747/1”), which is a mechanism that is installed on the steering column of an automobile and into which a driver exhales prior to starting their vehicle. The device in turn provides a blood-alcohol concentration analysis. If the driver’s blood-alcohol content is higher than a certain pre-programmed limit, the device prevents the ignition from engaging and the automobile from starting. These devices are often required for use by DUI or DWI (“driving under the influence” or “driving while intoxicated”) offenders as part of a mandatory court or motor vehicle department program.
Current Business
 
Shortly after changing our business focus towards the eSports industry, which we regard as a potentially high growth and profitable industry, we identified certain opportunities to engage in the business related to e-sports in South East Asia, which has seen high growth over the last 3 years, and determined that we should pursue that business opportunity. We entered into negotiations with LTL, and have closed that acquisition as of November 18, 2020.
 
Currently, the Company is a holding company and has no principal business other than LTL’s business. As a result of the closing of the SEA, LTL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which operates an eSports platform in Malaysia. All references to Company herein include its operating subsidiary LTL unless otherwise noted.
 
Esports Industry and Segment
 
Definition of eSports:
 
“Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of sport competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.” (Source: Wikipedia)

Growth of eSports
 
In 2020, the global eSports market was valued at just over US$950 million. According to the source's estimates, global eSports market revenue will reach almost US$1.6 billion in 2023. The eSports industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. The majority of these revenues come from sponsorships and advertising, and the rest from media rights, publisher fees, merchandise and tickets, digital and streaming. In terms of revenues, Asia and North America represent the two largest eSports markets, with China alone accounting for almost one fifth of the market. (Source: Statistica)
 
In 2016, ASEAN decided to enter the market by hosting its very own eSports tournament. Malaysia, in collaboration with eSports Malaysia hosted the first ever ASEAN Games for eSports (AGES) with a prize pool of around US$256,000.
 
Most recently, the 2018 Asian Games, held in Jakarta and Palembang simultaneously, had – for the first time – six demonstration games as part of its eSports event. The games were Arena Of Valor, Hearthstone, Pro Evolution Soccer, League Of Legends, Clash Royale and StarCraft 2. (Source: Newzoo)
 
Other reasons why the eSports market is increasing in the region are due to growing regional incomes. According to a Newzoo report from 2015, the “Big Six” countries in Southeast Asia for eSports are Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The report stated that these countries account for 99 percent of the region’s eSports revenue. The “Big Six” countries mentioned in the report have flourishing economies and a growing middle-class population. As populations grow, more disposable income is spent on hobbies and leisure activities which includes video games.

Market, Customer and Distribution Methods
 
Our focus in regards of target markets encompasses the emerging markets (South East Asia, Middle East, and South Asia) in terms of geography, and users between the ages of 17 – 35.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales strategy is geared towards a subscription model, at which users subscribe to a tournament pass that allows them to participate in a series of tournaments which has prize pools and benefits. Our partnerships with mobile network operators extend our payment reach through direct carrier billings with the mobile network operators in the respective countries in which we work.
 
By building up the community of e-sports players, brands can sponsor some of these prize pools by offering product ad placements, sampling and giveaways. This will be further amplified by offerings of ecommerce opportunities for brands to sell their product on our platform.
 
Our marketing strategy revolves around digital marketing through social media, brand marketing, influencer marketing and working with mobile carriers to co-promote our tournaments.

There has been increased competition on eSports providers in this region over the last 2 years. E-sports platforms such as ESPL, Mogul.gg, Yamisok, ESL, and several others are constantly expanding their reach across the South East Asian and South Asian markets.
 
Our key competitors include some of the following:-

Business Plan
 
The year 2020 saw most countries and economies deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, as it was still spreading across continents. While responding to the pandemic has led to many innovations and digitization in many sectors, eSports has also been affected. Esports has traditionally been offline-based, due to its competitive factor and focus on fair play. With on-ground events largely restricted, there has been a growth in online tournaments. More gamers are getting online to compete with others, as well as the growth of online viewers watching livestreams. This has also led to higher data consumption usage of the internet, mainly mobile data consumption.
 
2021 will see the Company focusing on working with mobile network operators within South East Asia to extend our platform’s (Matchroom) product offerings via a subscription model, at which mobile subscribers will subscribe to a data package that offers a tournament pass, at which users are able to compete in a series of tournaments that is offered.
 
Matchroom will focus on delivering eSports content to the market through the following:
 
1) White label solutions with mobile network operators to cater to their users
 
2) Launch of Matchroom’s Regional Tournaments and working with mobile network operators in each country to promote and provide a direct carrier billing subscription method for their users to subscribe.
 
3) Brand partnerships to carry out online eSports tournaments and livestream content for brand exposure and engagement.
