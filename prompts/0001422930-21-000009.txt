ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Mission
PubMatic fuels the endless potential of Internet content creators.
Overview
Our company provides a specialized cloud infrastructure platform that enables real-time programmatic advertising transactions. We believe that our purpose-built technology and infrastructure provides superior outcomes for both Internet content creators (publishers) and advertisers (buyers). For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our platform efficiently processed approximately 46.9 trillion ad impressions, up 69% from approximately 27.8 trillion ad impressions in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, each in a fraction of a second. 
PubMatic was founded in 2006 with the vision that data-driven decisions would be the future of advertising and since then we have invested significantly in developing our platform. By harnessing our massive data asset and leveraging our sophisticated machine learning algorithms, we increase publisher revenue, advertiser return on investment (“ROI”), and marketplace liquidity, while improving the cost efficiency of our technology platform and our publishers’ and buyers’ businesses.
Our cloud infrastructure platform provides superior monetization for publishers by increasing the value of an impression and providing incremental demand through our deep and growing relationships with buyers. Our global platform is omnichannel, supporting a wide array of ad formats and digital device types. We are aligned with our publisher and app developer partners by being independent. We do not own media and therefore do not have a vested interest in driving ad revenue to specific media properties. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we added approximately 360 new publishing partners. As of December 31, 2020, we served approximately 1,200 publishers and app developers, including many of the leading digital companies such as Verizon Media Group and News Corp. We have also demonstrated that we can retain and grow revenues from our publisher customers, as evidenced by our net dollar-based retention rate of 122% for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase from 109% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Building on our early success as a sell side platform (“SSP”), we have extended our platform to also meet the needs of buyers. We are integrated with the leading demand side platforms (“DSPs”), such as The Trade Desk and Google DV360, allowing them to execute real-time transactions with our publisher clients. More recently, agencies and advertisers have started consolidating their spend with fewer, larger technology platforms to improve transparency, quality, and control over their advertising dollars. We have entered into agreements with all of the major agency holding companies and some of the largest advertisers in the world and believe this will continue to drive more ad spend to our platform.
We believe we are positioned to benefit from several trends in the advertising industry, including the rapid proliferation of digital media, the emergence of new media and advertising formats, and the increasing sophistication of the digital advertising ecosystem. Innovations in how digital advertising is delivered have driven a meaningful increase in the available number of ad impressions to be processed, which occur when an advertisement is shown to an Internet user’s device. This growth has driven a corresponding need for scaled, real-time processing of massive volumes of data and efficient infrastructure. These trends are occurring as buyers and consumers seek increased transparency and governments are creating new data and privacy regulations.
We own and operate our own software and hardware infrastructure around the world, which saves significant costs as compared to companies that rely on public cloud alternatives, partly due to the data-intensive nature of digital advertising. As we have extended our cloud infrastructure to service an increasing number of ad formats and devices, we have expanded our profit margins and maintained our capital efficiency that is among best-in-class for similar publicly-traded technology companies.

Our culture and our team are two of the most important assets in building and expanding our business. We have been recognized as a “Great Place to Work” by Great Place to Work Institute Inc. and have benefited from strong employee retention rates. We foster deep employee engagement through personal development and learning to create a diverse and inclusive culture focused on rapid innovation, customer focus, and strong team execution. 
Global advertising (digital and traditional) spending was approximately $614 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to approximately $846 billion in 2024, according to eMarketer. As advertisers follow audiences online, digital advertising is expected to outpace growth of the overall advertising market. According to eMarketer, global digital ad spend is expected to be approximately $395 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a more than 10% rate annually over the next three years. We believe that changes in the digital advertising landscape will continue to enhance our market opportunity. 
Our Industry
Digital advertising is the primary business model of the Internet.
Advertising funds the creation of journalism, news, and entertainment, and for billions of consumers around the world, it subsidizes or enables free Internet consumption. Buyers can achieve significantly higher return on investment with online advertisements that are delivered both at scale and on a personalized basis. Publishers can successfully sell their advertising inventory by sharing data and information about their digital audiences on an individualized basis and at scale.
In recent years, the digital advertising ecosystem has become increasingly complex due to a variety of factors. While programmatic header bidding, a core digital advertising technology, has enabled the purchasing and selling of vast amounts of digital advertising inventory, there now exist significant challenges related to the proliferation of media across platforms, transaction speed, increased costs, transparency, and regulatory requirements. To address these issues at scale for both buyers and sellers, specialized software and hardware infrastructure are needed to optimally power these technology-driven transactions.
Rapid Proliferation of Digital Media Across Multiple Platforms
In the past decade, consumers have dramatically increased the amount of time that they spend online and on mobile devices communicating with friends, consuming media, conducting business, and researching and purchasing goods and services. According to eMarketer, consumers accessed the Internet via a mobile device on average 77 minutes per day in 2012. This usage increased to 202 minutes per day in 2019, an increase of 162%. Numerous activities that historically occurred offline continue to shift online, including visiting your doctor (telehealth), staying fit (streaming classes), ordering food (online delivery), and buying cars (online with local delivery), in addition to work and school from home. In order to better reach consumers, every major media format has transitioned or is in the process of transitioning content from traditional or analog means of delivery to digital. The television market transition to over-the-top (“OTT”) and connected TV (“CTV”), which is enabling consumers to stream content via the Internet, is the latest transition and represents a significant opportunity for digital advertising. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated digital adoption habits which should lead to further rapid growth in the number of available ad impressions that can be monetized programmatically, as well as increased advertiser budgets seeking to reach these audiences online. 
The Rise of Programmatic Header Bidding
Direct sales via manual, person-to-person processes are inadequate to create a real-time advertising marketplace for buyers and sellers. The challenges of scale and complexity of the digital advertising ecosystem require an automated and efficient approach to purchasing ads online, known as programmatic advertising. Programmatic advertising, on an automated basis, enables buyers, advertisers, and/or their ad agencies, to purchase ad impressions on publisher supplied inventory, including websites, apps, TVs, and various other formats to transact within milliseconds in a sophisticated, technology-driven marketplace. 
6


Header bidding, which came to prominence starting in 2016, further increased the complexity of programmatic advertising. Header bidding involves putting software code on a publisher’s website or app allowing it to host a single parallel auction with multiple interested parties simultaneously, rather than the earlier process of sequential auctions for that impression. This innovation has fundamentally transformed programmatic advertising by providing buyers with increased transparency and equal access to ad impressions, which results in greater demand for each ad impression and increased publisher revenue. According to Kevel, header bidding has now been adopted by 67% of digital publishers in the United States.
Massive Volumes of Data and Increased Costs
Header bidding has led to a significant increase in the number of ad impressions that need to be processed and analyzed in real-time by each participant in the digital advertising ecosystem. As consumers increasingly engage with digital media, and as advertisers bid on a growing array of ad formats and impressions, an immense amount of data is generated. The data includes anonymized consumer information about interests and intent, log files of winning and losing advertiser bids, and transaction records for billing and payment reconciliation. Technology infrastructure platforms must rapidly process this data while offering a seamless digital ad experience for consumers. 
Growing transaction volumes and increasingly complex data processing requirements can lead to rising overall costs for technology vendors. While header bidding increases the number of SSPs processing each ad impression, the underlying number of opportunities to place a personalized ad in front of a consumer does not grow, which creates processing complexity. Similarly, as SSPs process more ad impressions due to header bidding, so must DSPs. Each of these trends created by header bidding can significantly increase costs for technology providers if not properly addressed with superior technology.
Ad Spending Consolidating on Fewer Sell Side Platforms 
As advertisers increase the percentage of their overall advertising budgets spent on digital formats, they are increasingly demanding improved transparency and control of their entire digital advertising supply chain. Transparency includes understanding what fees are being paid for every ad transaction, to whom the fees are being paid, and what value is being delivered by every fee recipient. In addition, transparency allows the advertiser to know the type of ad inventory being purchased and the content appearing adjacent to the advertiser’s ads to avoid purchasing fraudulent or fake inventory or appearing next to content that reflects poorly on the advertiser’s brand. This desire for transparency and control has led to a growing trend for advertisers to establish direct relationships with vendors in the digital advertising ecosystem that have transparent business practices and technical capabilities to meet their objectives. This has resulted in a larger portion of media spend consolidating onto fewer, more transparent technology platforms.
Protecting Consumer Privacy and Regulatory Challenges
There is an increasing awareness of how Internet user data is being leveraged to target ads, resulting in a growing number of privacy laws and regulations being established globally, including the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the European Union, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) in California, and the Video Privacy Protection Act in the United States. We believe these trends will continue locally and globally. There have also been a growing number of consumer-focused non-profit organizations and commercial entities advocating for privacy rights. These institutions are enabling Internet consumers to assert their rights over the use of their online data in advertising transactions, a trend which we support.
7


The digital advertising landscape must continue to adapt to these trends and incorporate awareness of consumer privacy and compliance with regulatory authorities. For example, publishers, and their downstream supply and demand partners, are required to obtain unambiguous consent from European Union data subjects to process their personal data. In addition to legal and policy requirements, participants in the digital advertising supply chain were encouraged to agree upon technical specifications to collect and transmit detailed records of consent (or an alternative basis for the processing of personal data) and the purposes of that data processing. This demand resulted in widespread adoption of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (the “IAB”) Transparency & Consent Framework 2.0 (the “TCF”) in August 2020. Prior to the TCF, dueling technical standards resulted in industry-wide confusion following adoption of the GDPR. 
Over the years, Apple has greatly limited the use of third-party cookies within its web browser (Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention) and recently announced the decision to make the app-based Identifier for Advertisers (the “IDFA”) opt-in by consumers rather than opt-out. Google is also, along with Apple, leading an active industry dialog to deliver the next wave of privacy compliant advertising solutions. Google announced its intention to limit the use of third-party cookies potentially starting in 2022 in its Chrome web browser, as well as limit the use of alternate user-level tracking technologies and browsing history in its own ad platforms. We believe the “Open Internet” outside the “walled gardens” (a colloquial term that refers to closed advertising platforms including Google and Facebook) will shift from targeting by anonymized and invisible third-party cookies or identifiers to known identities based on consumer choice and opt-in. This shift towards significantly more reliable and accurate consumer identity has the potential to significantly increase advertiser ROI and therefore publisher revenue.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that changes in the digital advertising landscape greatly enhance our market opportunity, namely: increasing impression volumes and data requirements, the growing desirability of Open Internet advertising, increased demand for transparent and privacy-safe solutions, and complex regulatory and commercial requirements.
Global advertising (digital and traditional) spending was approximately $614 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow to approximately $846 billion in 2024, according to eMarketer. As advertisers follow audiences online, digital advertising is expected to outpace growth of the overall advertising market. According to eMarketer, global digital ad spend is expected to be approximately $395 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a more than 10% rate annually over the next three years. We believe that changes in the digital advertising landscape will continue to enhance our market opportunity. 
Our solutions enable advertising on the Open Internet. While walled gardens have grown their market share in recent years, advertisers have become increasingly dissatisfied with their limited ability to access and use their data outside the walled gardens, the lack of control over the user-generated content shown next to their ads, and the poor stewardship of user data. As a result of these concerns, more than 1,000 advertisers on Facebook, including five of their top 20 advertisers, announced their intention to pause ad budgets in 2020. In contrast, Open Internet advertising can provide advertisers control over where their ads appear, enable access to high quality, professional content, allow control over their data, and achieve transparency into the cost of media and associated technology fees. As publishers improve their ability to target ads using known consumer identity, the Open Internet offers the potential to further increase advertiser ROI, grow publisher revenue, and expand our market opportunity.

Our Role in the Digital Advertising Ecosystem
Our platform is a key component of powering the digital advertising ecosystem because of the role we play in meeting the needs of ad sellers and ad buyers.
Publishers and App Developers. Publishers and app developers create websites and apps that contain content for consumers along with adjacent viewable space for advertisements. As consumers navigate through these websites and apps, individual ad impressions are shown to them. These impressions are typically sold to buyers programmatically in real-time via a third-party technology infrastructure platform or SSP. Publishers and app developers rely on advertising revenue as the key driver for their businesses and rely on the capabilities of these third parties in order to achieve optimal yield for their advertising inventory. 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we added approximately 360 new publishing partners. As of December 31, 2020, we served approximately 1,200 publishers and app developers worldwide on our platform, consisting of over 60,000 domains and 20,000 apps, including many of the leading digital companies such as Verizon Media Group and News Corp. We have also demonstrated that we can retain and grow revenues from our publisher customers, as evidenced by our net dollar-based retention rate of 122% for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase from 109% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Sell Side Platforms. Traditionally referred to as sell side platforms or SSPs, platforms such as ours are designed to monetize inventory for publishers and app developers. Buyers and sellers come together through our marketplace to present, target, and purchase available advertising inventory. Our platform rapidly and efficiently processes significant volumes of ad bid data, providing a seamless digital experience for consumers. Traditionally, SSPs have focused exclusively on the needs of sellers in this process, and have limited their interactions with buyers to the buyer’s agent, the demand side platform or DSP. As buyers have sought greater control of their advertising supply chains, we have extended the capabilities of our specialized cloud infrastructure platform over the last several years to serve the needs of advertisers and agencies as well.
Demand Side Platforms. Advertisers and agencies often engage demand side platforms, which act as advertising demand aggregators, to execute their digital marketing campaigns across various ad formats. We are integrated with the leading DSPs around the world, such as The Trade Desk and Google DV360, enabling them to execute real-time transactions with our publisher clients. We maintain active integrations with DSPs around the world, some of which are global and omnichannel in nature or more narrowly targeted on specific ad formats or geographic markets.

Advertisers and Agencies. Spending begins with advertisers, who often engage advertising agencies to help plan and execute their advertising campaigns. To better control and optimize their advertising operations, advertisers and agencies are consolidating their spend with fewer, larger technology platforms who can deliver transparency and ensure the highest levels of inventory quality and control. We have entered into agreements with all of the major agency holding companies and some of the largest advertisers in the world and believe this will continue to drive more ad spend to our platform. These advertisers and agencies access our platform through DSPs. We believe our purpose-built technology platform and direct relationships with advertisers and agencies will lead to significant consolidation of spend onto our platform. 
Our Specialized Cloud Infrastructure Platform
We are a specialized cloud infrastructure provider that enables real-time programmatic advertising transactions in a market characterized by significant data and impression volumes, regulatory complexity, and increased focus on transparency and privacy. Over the past 14 years we have built, enhanced and deployed our technology infrastructure to address these market conditions and provide superior outcomes for both publishers and buyers.
We have deployed our purpose-built infrastructure globally in order to serve our customers with the high-speed transaction capabilities required to provide a seamless digital ad experience for consumers. Our offering is omnichannel and targets a diverse set of publishers touching many ad formats, and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, over-the-top and connected TV, and rich media.
Real-time Ad Transaction Processing 
We have designed our specialized cloud infrastructure for the rapid and efficient processing of real-time, programmatic ad transactions and the aggregation and analysis of the significant data accompanying each transaction. We power our cloud platform by proprietary our software deployed on PubMatic-owned and operated hardware close to our customers around the world. Our technology platform processes each potential ad in a fraction of a second to optimize the consumer ad experience. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our platform efficiently processed approximately 46.9 trillion ad impressions, up 69% from approximately 27.8 trillion ad impressions in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.
Sophisticated, Purpose-built Technology that Delivers Superior Outcomes
Since our founding, we have believed that data-driven decisions would be the future of advertising and have accordingly invested in developing our machine learning capabilities. By harnessing our massive data assets and advanced machine learning capabilities, we are able to deliver superior outcomes by increasing advertiser ROI and publisher revenue, while increasing the cost efficiency of our platform and our customers’ and partners’ businesses. Some examples of the outcomes of our machine learning competencies include:
•Reducing buyers’ and our operational costs. Our algorithms determine the optimal traffic to send to each buyer, and then prioritize the DSPs most likely to bid on and win a particular ad impression, which in turn reduces the number of bid requests we send them, leading to reduced costs for buyers and for us.
•Increasing publisher revenue while maximizing the buyer’s probability of winning. Our system dynamically predicts the winning price of an auction and seeks to ensure that a buyer’s bid is high enough to clear this price.
We created our own internal machine learning program to train promising engineers to further our machine learning technology and over the last two years have developed over 60 machine learning based software projects through this program. Today, every engineering team at PubMatic has machine learning expertise embedded within it.

Independent and Customer Aligned 
We are aligned with our customers, both publishers and buyers, by being an independent infrastructure platform. We do not own media and therefore do not have a vested interest in driving ad revenue to specific media properties. We do not take a position in media or arbitrage media. Our independence and alignment have resulted in a strong level of trust and confidence among publishers and buyers alike that our data-driven software decisions and our recommendations are in their best interests. As evidence of this, each of our top ten buyers by spend have been integrated and buying on our platform for over seven years.
Transparency and Quality for Agencies and Advertisers
We operate on a fundamental principle of transparency, being one of the first digital advertising infrastructure platforms to provide log-level data to buyers and provide transparency on every ad impression. In addition, advertisers utilizing our cloud infrastructure have full control over which publishers, ad formats, and specific ad impressions on which they would like to bid. We are among the first to offer a fraud-free program in 2017 where buyers are credited for any fraudulent inventory they may have purchased on our platform. Our buyers have experienced very low fraud levels with credits of 0.22% of overall ad spending on our platform in the fourth quarter of 2020. This compares very favorably to a recent Trustworthy Accountability Group industry average of fraud at 11% of advertising spending. 
Enabling Identity on the Open Internet
As advertising in the Open Internet shifts from targeting by anonymized and invisible third-party cookies that consumers must opt out of, and instead towards known first-party identity based on consumer choice and opt-in or other privacy compliant solutions, publishers and advertisers must transition to a new identity paradigm. While there are various constituents across the digital advertising industry creating new identity solutions, we have built a comprehensive platform that greatly simplifies the implementation and ongoing management of identity solution providers. Our solution allows for the use of many of the leading identifiers in a scaled and privacy-compliant fashion resulting in increased publisher revenue and buyer ROI.
Scalable, Self-service Platform that Eases the Burden of a Complex Digital Advertising Landscape
Our cloud infrastructure solutions are available via self-serve, including an easy-to-use customer user interface and a set of application programming interfaces that allow our publisher customers to configure new inventory, extend into new geographies or ad formats, review reporting insights, and manage and track payments and billing cycles. Our platform also assists with managing the increasingly complex compliance burdens brought on by new industry guidelines and government regulations. We provide the tools and the mechanisms to help enable publisher inventory to be in compliance with these norms and requirements, maintaining strong data minimization practices, and allocating responsibility for data flows and legal compliance in agreements with vendors, publishers, and buyers.
Our Strengths
Publishers are actively seeking to maximize the value of their ad inventory, and buyers are seeking to increase advertising ROI. We believe that our efficient cloud infrastructure, rapid innovation, and transparent business model provide incentives to ad buyers to consolidate an increasing share of their total digital spend on our platform. At the same time, our direct publisher relationships, omnichannel header bidding capabilities, global scale, and access to incremental advertiser demand through direct relationships with buyers drive superior yield for publishers.
11


We believe the following strengths provide us with long-term competitive advantages:
Investment in Innovation Enabled by Profitable Business Model
Our business model driven by our technology platform, owned infrastructure, and offshore research and development has led to positive net income for five consecutive years and positive Adjusted EBITDA for eight consecutive years. We have generated positive net cash provided by operating activities for seven consecutive years and an average gross margin over 70% for the last nine years. We have consistently achieved among best-in-class margins compared to other similar publicly-traded technology companies. Our structural cost advantages enable us to continuously invest in driving innovation, while delivering both top line revenue growth and profitability. 
Flexible Platform and Culture of Rapid Innovation
We built our company and our technology platform to be highly dynamic and to support rapid innovation. Our product and development teams are focused on continuous innovation and enhancement of our products and solutions. We believe that the flexibility of our platform and responsiveness to evolving customer needs and technical requirements enables us to achieve superior outcomes for our customers.
Since our founding, we have invested significantly in a software ideation, development, build, test, and deployment process that allows us to routinely convert a requirement into working software within two weeks or less. Our platform is highly modular, which allows us to innovate and improve individual software components without affecting the rest of the platform. We utilize a microservices architecture to interconnect each module via application programming interfaces with defined interfaces for internal and external consumption. We focus on reliability and scalability of each individual module and across our platform to maximize uptime and scale up based on customer demand. In 2020, we released new software across our global infrastructure approximately 326 times, more than once per business day. The result of our flexible platform and culture of rapid innovation is that we are highly responsive to evolving customer needs, which we believe is important in a rapidly evolving digital advertising industry.
Indicative of the flexibility and robustness of our platform, since header bidding’s rise in 2016, we have increased the efficiency of our platform dramatically, introduced solutions to make auctions more transparent for advertisers, and expanded our header bidding technology beyond desktop to mobile web, mobile app, digital video, and most recently OTT/CTV. 
Highly Efficient Infrastructure
As a result of our long-term, internal development efforts on our technology stack and strategic approach of owning our own hardware, we believe that we have among the lowest cost infrastructures of any specialized cloud infrastructure platform in the advertising market. We own and operate our proprietary software and hardware infrastructure around the world. This approach saves significant costs compared to companies that rely on public cloud alternatives due to the data-intensive nature of digital advertising and the immense volume of ad impressions created by header bidding. Since our inception, we have built and constantly improved upon our infrastructure, and in turn we have developed a deep expertise in continuously optimizing and growing it. As a result, our cost of revenue per impression processed decreased by 32% in 2020 compared to 2019, and decreased by 18% in 2019 compared to 2018. We believe that the capital efficiency and operating expertise requirements that we possess present a significant barrier to entry. Even as we grow the applicability of our cloud infrastructure to include more ad formats and devices, such as mobile, video, and now OTT/CTV, we have maintained strong capital efficiency as measured by revenue per dollar of capital expenditures. The efficiency of our infrastructure has enabled us to grow our access to first-party data, which generally refers to customer owned audience data, ad impression and bid request data, and advertiser bid response data, further driving superior results across our platform for buyers and sellers.
12


Since our founding, the vast majority of our technology team, which represents 44% of our workforce, has been based in Pune, India, with an average tenure of 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020. Many of our senior engineers have worked together at PubMatic since the founding of our company. Our mindset and culture of driving efficiency across our business, whether in engineering, sales, marketing, or elsewhere, continuously pushes us to find ways to achieve greater results with less human and capital resources. 
Machine Learning and Data Processing
We leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to record, aggregate, analyze, and act on vast amounts of data to help our customers optimize their digital advertising businesses in real-time. In December 2020, our technology platform processed approximately 187 billion ad impressions and 2 petabytes of data every day. This data includes first party customer owned audience data, ad impression and bid request data, and advertiser bid response data. We flow all of this data through our machine learning platform in order to run thousands of algorithmic iterations on trillions of data points per month. These capabilities improves long term marketplace liquidity resulting in increased publisher revenue and higher advertiser ROI.
Customer Trust and Alignment
We are aligned with both publishers and buyers, by being an independent and transparent infrastructure provider. We do not own media and therefore do not have a vested interest in driving ad revenue to specific media properties. We do not take a position in media or arbitrage media. We operate with a fundamental principle of transparency and provide detailed insights into fees to our customers. Our customers can therefore be confident that our algorithmic software decisions and our guidance are independent and in their best interests. Our trusted status has enabled us to build direct relationships with publishers, advertisers, agencies, and DSPs. Our ability to meet the demands of both buyers and inventory sellers enables us to produce superior outcomes for all industry participants.
Global, Omnichannel Reach
We are a global business with distributed critical infrastructure and a go-to-market presence in every major advertising market in the world outside of China. Many of our publisher customers have diversified businesses with media properties and audiences across the globe and with a wide variety of ad products including display and video ads across desktop, tablet, mobile, and connected TV devices. Similarly, many of our advertiser and agency customers have brand portfolios that span the globe with a variety of ad campaign requirements – from branding to performance, to combinations thereof. All of these parties actively seek global, omnichannel platform providers that can solve for their needs around the world and across ad formats and devices. By providing global, omnichannel reach of our infrastructure, we are well positioned to help publishers and ad buyers make their advertising businesses more efficient and effective. 
Growth Strategy
We believe we are positioned to benefit from tailwinds in the advertising industry, including the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for purpose-built infrastructure to address the increasing complexity in the digital advertising landscape, and increasing consumer time spent online, all of which have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our growth strategy includes:
Attract New Publishers and Expand our Relationship with Existing Publishers
We constantly seek to acquire new high-quality publishers around the world. New publisher clients may include major media companies, app developers, e-commerce providers, and OTT platforms– any company that monetizes its audience through digital advertising. Once acquired, we seek to expand our relationship with existing publishers by establishing multiple header bidding integrations, leveraging our omnichannel capabilities to maximize our access to publishers’ ad formats and devices, and expanding into the various properties that a publisher may own around the world. We may also up-sell additional products to publisher customers including our header bidding management as well as identity and audience solutions. To capitalize on new and existing publisher 
13


opportunities, we continue to grow our specialized customer success teams, which are structured around specific ad formats, products and geographies. We have demonstrated that we can retain and grow revenues from our publisher customers, as evidenced by our net dollar-based retention rates of 122% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 109% for 2019.
Attract New Buyers and Expand our Relationship with Existing Buyers
We strive to acquire new buyers (including advertisers, agencies and DSPs) through our strong value proposition that includes omnichannel real-time bidding, transparency, our fraud-free program and efficiency. We work with DSPs to help them reduce their costs and improve advertiser ROI, which in turn makes us the specialized cloud infrastructure platform of choice for many of our buying partners. As advertisers and agencies increasingly consolidate their spending with fewer larger technology platforms, we seek to increase the proportion of their digital ad spending on our platform through direct relationships. We have entered into Supply Path Optimization (“SPO”) agreements directly with both advertisers and agencies through various arrangements ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features, and volume-based business terms. The effect of these SPO agreements is to increase the volume of ad spend on our platform without corresponding increases in technology costs. We have expanded and realigned our sales team to focus on advertisers and agencies directly and will continue to hire additional sales headcount to support these efforts. 
Efficiently Expand Our Infrastructure Platform to Process More Ad Impressions
The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated digital adoption, which should lead to further growth in the number of available ad impressions that can be monetized programmatically as well as increase in advertiser budgets seeking to reach various audiences digitally. We have a track record of cost-effectively expanding the capacity of our infrastructure platform as exemplified by average daily ad impressions having increased approximately 300% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 compared to three months ended March 31, 2018, while the corresponding costs related to processing these impressions have increased approximately 45%. We expect to continue to invest in both software and hardware infrastructure to continue growing the number of valuable ad impressions we process on our platform. 
Improve Liquidity in Our Marketplace
We strive to continuously improve publisher revenue and advertiser ROI by investing in our technology and improving our machine learning capabilities. We leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, alongside our growing publisher and buyer relationships, to improve liquidity in our marketplace. Increasing numbers of ad impressions, increasing advertiser bids, and data proliferation provide us with many opportunities to better match sellers and buyers of ad inventory. We believe that improved matching will lead to growth of our platform and greater publisher and buyer retention.
Develop New Products
As we grow our customer base and process increasing volumes of ad impressions and data, we gain insights into new challenges we can solve on behalf of our customers. We have successfully introduced multiple new products into the market over the past 12 months, including our identity solution (Identity Hub), our header bidding management solution for OTT (OpenWrap OTT), and our audience data platform (Audience Encore). We are constantly focused on creating new products that we believe solve our customers’ needs.

Expand Into New Ad Formats
We have demonstrated an ability to extend header bidding into a variety of ad formats – initially desktop display, then mobile web, mobile app, digital video, and most recently with OTT/CTV. As technology and media evolve, additional ad formats may become attractive to us – whether existing in the ecosystem today or entirely new. These may include audio/podcast ads, native ads and digital out of home ads. Each ad format represents an opportunity to further extend our cloud infrastructure, increase our platform utilization, and acquire new customers or expand our relationship with existing customers. 
Expand into New Geographies
We decide to enter new advertising markets around the world based on size, growth rate, and other characteristics. For example, in 2018, we entered Indonesia, in 2019 we entered South Korea. We are constantly evaluating new markets with a strategy to use our existing global infrastructure and adjacent sales office, or by expanding our infrastructure footprint and placing personnel directly in those markets.
Our Publishers and App Developers
We primarily work with publishers and app developers who allow us direct access to their ad inventory, as well as select channel partners that meet our quality and scale thresholds. We have direct relationships with publishers such as Verizon Media Group and News Corp and app developers such as Zynga and Electronic Arts. Our channel partners aggregate and provide further access to thousands of sites and apps from smaller publishers. We refer to our publishers, app developers, and channel partners collectively as our publishers.
We help monetize valuable impressions for our clients across a wide array of ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, OTT/CTV, and rich media. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we added approximately 360 new publishing partners. As of December 31, 2020, we served approximately 1,200 publishers and app developers, representing over 80,000 individual domains and apps worldwide on our platform across a diverse group of content verticals including news, eCommerce, gaming, media, weather, fashion, technology, and more. 
We believe our specialized cloud infrastructure platform provides the following benefits:
•Customer alignment. We are aligned with our publishers by being an independent infrastructure provider. We do not own media and therefore do not have a vested interest in driving ad revenue to specific media properties.
•Monetization. Through our infrastructure-based approach, we provide superior monetization for publishers. We achieve this by increasing the value of each impression by enhancing available data and providing incremental demand via our deep relationships with buyers.
•Innovation. Since our inception, we have consistently delivered new capabilities to our publishers, including Identity Hub, OpenWrap OTT, and Audience Encore. 
•Global, Omni-channel. Our offering is global, omni-channel and efficient for our publishers to work with, targeting a wide array of ad formats and digital device types, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, connected TV, and rich media.
•Compliance. We assist publishers with their regulatory compliance by managing advertising transactions in a transparent manner with our buyers, adopting industry wide technical specifications and business processes that respect consumer choices, and providing guidance on best practices regarding user consents and opt-outs.

We are party to an agreement with Yahoo! Inc., which was assumed by Verizon Media Group upon its acquisition of Yahoo in 2017, pursuant to which Verizon Media Group is a publisher customer of ours. The initial term of this agreement ended in December 2016, and it automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party provides at least 30 days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate for convenience immediately upon prior written notice. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Verizon Media Group accounted for 20% and 28%, of our revenue, respectively.
Our Buyers
Buyers on our platform include DSPs, agencies and individual advertisers. We have broad exposure to the ecosystem of buyers, reaching on average approximately 73,000 advertisers per month in 2020. As spending on programmatic advertising increasingly becomes a larger share of overall ad spending, advertisers and agencies are seeking greater control of their digital advertising supply chains. To take advantage of this industry shift, we have entered into SPO agreements directly with buyers. As part of these agreements, we are providing advertisers and agencies with benefits ranging from custom data and workflow integrations, product features, and volume-based business terms. As a result of these direct relationships, our existing advertisers and agencies are incentivized to allocate an increasing percentage of their advertising budgets to our platform. We are increasing buyer spend on our platform for the following reasons:
•Buyer Alignment. We do not own media and therefore do not have a vested interest in driving ad revenue to specific media properties. We do not take a position in media or arbitrage media.
•Omnichannel Real Time Bidding. Advertisers and agencies often have a large portfolio of brands requiring a variety of campaign types and support for a wide array of inventory formats and devices. Our omnichannel platform meets these requirements, which is a further driver of efficiency for our buyers. 
•Transparent business model. We were one of the first Sell Side Platforms to provide log-level data to buyers and provide fee transparency on every ad impression. 
•Inventory quality. We operate one of the most comprehensive processes in the digital advertising ecosystem to enhance inventory quality. We were among the first to offer a fraud-free program in 2017 where our buyers are credited for any fraudulent inventory they may have purchased on our platform.
•Efficiency. We work closely with DSPs to make them more efficient which has led to certain DSPs consolidating their spend on our platform. Our algorithms determine the optimal traffic to send to each buyer, and then prioritize the DSPs most likely to bid on and win a particular ad impression, which reduces the number of bid requests we send them, leading to reduced costs for buyers and for us.
Two of our largest DSP relationships are with Google and The Trade Desk. We are party to an agreement with Google LLC, under which Google is a buyer on our platform. The initial one-year term of the current agreement ended in May 2019, and it automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice at least 60 days’ prior to the end of the initial term or such successive terms. Either party may terminate for convenience upon providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice. We signed a prior similar agreement with a Google subsidiary in 2012. We are also party to an agreement with The Trade Desk, Inc., under which The Trade Desk is a buyer on our platform. The initial term of the agreement ended in November 2013, and it automatically renews for successive one-year terms. Either party may terminate for convenience upon providing at least 30 days’ prior written notice.

Our Technology 
Overview
We have designed our technology to efficiently process real-time advertising transactions while leveraging data to optimize outcomes for publishers and buyers. We own and operate our software and hardware infrastructure globally, which saves significant infrastructure expenditures as compared to public cloud alternatives. We designed our platform using a flexible, service-oriented architecture in order to facilitate rapid development of new solutions, to meet evolving industry demands, and to support new use cases and new ad formats. Our omni-channel platform supports a wide array of publishers, ad formats and devices, including mobile app, mobile web, desktop, display, video, OTT/CTV, and rich media. 
Rapid innovation is a core driver of our business success and our corporate culture. Our technical personnel are located across our global offices in Pune, India, Redwood City, California, and New York, New York. Our agile development process and flexible, service-oriented architecture empower our development teams to routinely convert a requirement into working software within a typical time frame of two weeks or less. In 2020, we released new software across our global infrastructure approximately 326 times, more than once per business day. 
We offer our solution as a complete, unified offering for publishers who want a simple, efficient and comprehensive solution. We also offer modular access to our platform via rich application programming interfaces and a mobile SDK, for publishers who wish to integrate with or extend the platform, or develop new business models and custom advertising solutions.
Data 
Among the central benefits of our software platform is the processing, management and analysis of valuable data assets. The tens of billions of ad impressions and nearly trillion advertiser bids that we process every day generate enormous volumes of data that we harness to drive higher revenue for our publishers and increased ROI for our buyers. This data includes:
•Ad impression and bid request data, which contain parameters such as page URL or app bundle ID, location of the user, operating system of the user’s device, device type, ad size and ad location on the page;
•First party customer owned audience data, such as segment data that specifies whether a consumer is a recent shopper for electronics or automobiles; and
•Advertiser bid response data, which is bidding data received from DSPs, agencies, and advertisers.
We have developed proprietary data and analytics offerings that allow publishers to monitor their ad business in near real-time, as well as advanced tools publishers can use to find new business opportunities, optimize their monetization strategy, and help maximize the value of their digital ad business. This data is also used by our machine learning algorithms to enhance our bidding and auctioning process by analyzing large datasets and applying algorithms to drive optimal results. 
17


Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
We analyze the data on our platform through extensive application of artificial intelligence technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing. Examples of how we leverage our artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to improve outcomes for our customers are:
•Identify valuable ad impressions and predict auction behavior: When our machine learning models predict that an impression will attract high bids, our algorithms adjust pricing guidance to bidders in real time, which can lead to significant inventory yield improvements for publishers and higher win rates for ad buyers. 
•Optimize impression selection: Our ability to accurately predict and monetize high value impressions allows us to operate more efficiently, due to the fact that the cost of processing low-value impressions and high-value impressions are approximately the same. Our algorithms, such as impression throttling, deploy a variety of levers to optimize traffic sent to DSPs, agencies, and advertisers. 
•Improve our self-service capabilities: Publishers can enter natural language queries, such as “Show me average CPM for yesterday” and the analytics system will generate charts and tables with relevant data for rapid and informative analysis.
We have developed a proprietary machine learning training curriculum called the ML2 Program in order to significantly expand our use of machine learning throughout our technical organization. In the past two years, 219 machine learning training courses have been completed by 99 of our engineers who have then leveraged that learning to solve PubMatic specific problems. In total, we have completed over 60 machine learning projects over the last two years.
Programmatic Header Bidding
We are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable and improve header bidding for our customers. We developed an enterprise wrapper, OpenWrap, that was among the first header bidding solutions launched for general availability. OpenWrap was released in April 2016 and enables publishers to holistically manage and configure all header bidding partners through a powerful, synchronized and intuitive user interface. OpenWrap provides a transparent, real-time view into bid activity and volume, monetization and latency metrics which allow publishers to make smarter decisions and drive sustainable monetization. Our cloud infrastructure is interoperable with the other major header bidding software frameworks including open source Prebid, Google’s Open Bidding, Amazon’s Transparent Ad Marketplace, and others. We believe we are thought leaders in the header bidding space and are represented on the boards of Prebid and the IAB Tech Lab.
We have continuously enhanced the capabilities of our OpenWrap solution and our header bidding technology. For example, in 2017, we expanded OpenWrap’s header bidding technology to mobile app developers and introduced the industry’s first hybrid client and server side wrapper. In 2019, we launched the OpenWrap SDK for in-app developers. In 2020, we launched header bidding support for OTT and CTV inventory and announced that our Identity Hub product would support server-to-server integration with OpenWrap.
Regulatory Compliance
A growing set of privacy regulations have introduced complexity regarding the collection, use, and transmission of consumer data to the digital advertising ecosystem. Most notably, the GDPR that took effect in May 2018 and the CCPA that took effect in January 2020, among other global privacy laws and regulations, have created a compliance burden for advertisers, publishers, and their partners to navigate. The advertising industry has developed a number of the technical and policy solutions to create standards for compliance, such as IAB TCF.
18


We have implemented a number of technology innovations, process enhancements, and industry solutions in response to our publishers’ increased obligations. Through the TCF and other frameworks, we can identify and pass user consent parameters, and opt-in or opt-out as applicable, in a bid request. We are also able to evaluate whether such consents apply to our various demand partners, such as DSPs and agencies. Some of the specific measures we have taken include:
•User Consent. Working with publishers and channel partners to ensure appropriate consent is being obtained, recorded, and transmitted as applicable. 
•Data Mapping. Undertaking data mapping exercises for the purpose of understanding data flows in how we collect, use, and transmit personal information from our publishers, buyers, and data providers.
•Data Minimization. Establishing mechanisms to collect only the data that is needed and pseudonymizing data wherever possible (including masking IP address or geolocation data as applicable).
•Data Retention. Implementing a short data retention period across our technology platform so that we promptly delete, aggregate, or anonymize consumer data.
•Publisher and Demand Side Agreements. Monitoring and updating our agreements with publishers, DSPs, agencies, and advertisers, as applicable, to address privacy and regulatory compliance.
Inventory Quality
The quality of the inventory made available to advertisers has a significant impact on their ROI. Bad actors promoting botnets, fake ads, ad stuffing and other malignant methodologies reduce the ROI for advertisers and siphon dollars away from quality publishers. We have developed a multi-pronged strategy to create a high-quality marketplace beginning with high quality publisher selection, supported by proprietary and third-party fraud detection software, manual review, timely fraud investigations, and a fraud-free program in which buyers are credited for any fraudulent inventory they may have purchased on our platform. Our buyers have experienced very low fraud levels with credits of 0.22% of overall ad spending on our platform in the fourth quarter of 2020. This compares very favorably to a recent Trustworthy Accountability Group industry average of fraud at 10.83% of advertising spending.
Ad Quality 
Ad quality refers to the quality of the advertisements that run on publishers’ sites. We have developed proprietary solutions targeting the reduction of security issues, including malware, redirects, unsafe code, and other similar practices; quality issues, including unsafe creative categories (such as alcohol or drugs) and creative attributes (Inbanner video, Expandables, Text Ads); and performance issues, including network load, number of trackers and memory size.
On an average day, we scan nearly one million new advertisement creatives in near real-time using our Real-Time Ad Scanning (“RTAS”) system. RTAS connects to proprietary technology and partners’ services to extract the nature of creatives. Publishers can configure their preferences for quality attributes using our blocklist manager, creative attribute selection, and keyword blocking. A comprehensive reporting suite is available for publishers to monitor the top performing creatives and review the lost opportunity due to excessive blocking.
19


Log-level Transparency and Insights
We enable buyers to gain additional transparency and insights to help them inform future ad buying and optimize their supply paths by providing them access to log-level data, which is comprised of various attributes that are relevant to a single ad impression within an auction. Log-level data provides buyers transaction verification data, or how the auction operates and what fees are being charged. 
Reporting
Our technology platform provides extensive reporting capabilities to both buyers and publishers via application programming interfaces for direct integration into a customer’s reporting systems. Publishers are able to review performance, monitor key performance indicators (“KPIs”), and make adjustments to their set up and optimization. Buyers have access to campaign insight data to facilitate testing and adaptation toward maximizing ROI. Detailed performance by ad format, channels, and ad sizes allows for optimization to achieve maximum performance.
Self-Service
We design and implement self-service workflow solutions to allow publishers to efficiently manage their ad inventory. For example, publishers can update their own price floors, add or remove advertisers from blocklists, add new web sites and mobile apps, manage optimize their header bidding set ups, and leverage identity graphs from multiple ID providers. Ad buyers can configure the attributes for the inventory they desire, setup new or adjust existing Private Marketplace deals, and access extensive reporting on their media buying activities with us.
Our Team and Culture
Our culture and our team are our most important asset in building and expanding our business. Our team identifies new problems to solve, builds solutions, optimizes and extends our infrastructure, and acquires and serves customers. We believe that strong and diverse customer teams deepen customer relationships, promote innovation, and increase productivity.
Our people strategy revolves around creating employee experiences that foster deep employee engagement built upon personal development and achievement that is supported by continuous feedback, learning, and team building. Our steadfast focus on driving employee engagement has resulted in increasing employee retention rates (90% annualized employee retention through the twelve months of 2020) and average global tenure (3.3 years as of December 31, 2020). Our workplaces in the United States have been certified by Great Place To Work (2017-2021) and recognized on Fortune’s list of Best Workplaces in the Bay Area 2020. Our India subsidiary has also been certified by Great Place To Work (2018-2021) as well as named to the list of Great Mid-size Workplaces and Best Workplaces in IT & IT-BPM in 2019 and 2020.
We have achieved these results by delivering custom learning programs and creating opportunities for advancement that align with the dynamic needs of our business. Our practice of open and transparent communication coupled with a performance-based approach to compensation has created a culture in which employees feel empowered in their ability to influence and impact our business and be rewarded for their efforts. The value proposition we offer to our employees is rounded out with strong benefits programs that include paid family leave, health and wellness benefits and company sponsored opportunities to give back to the communities in which they work and live.
20


We are also committed to being inclusive in our hiring practices, promotion practices, and management practices as a means of ensuring equal opportunity for all employees as we continue to diversify our workforce. The diversity of our workforce has been publicly documented since 2017 with our annual Diversity & Inclusion Report. Our Inclusion Action Plan for 2020-2021 consists of five areas that focus on listening, learning, hiring, socio-economic support, and activism. This plan will be executed in part by our newly established Diversity & Inclusion Committee. The plan has a global focus that takes into consideration regional cultural differences to provide interactive employee experiences that drive continuous support for inclusion throughout our organization.
It has always been our goal to attract and retain the best talent in the industry and our inclusive interview process includes finding those candidates that best add to our company mission, values, and cultural principles. These three guiding elements form a social contract between employees as well as set expectations for the common behaviors we can expect from each other and inform how we treat our customers. They are infused in every aspect of our business, from employee experience and workplace culture to marketing strategies and customers success. 
Our mission: fuel the endless potential of Internet content creators. 
Values:
•We put the customer first.
•We are biased towards action.
•We are leaders and innovators.
•We are committed to integrity.
•We celebrate teamwork.
Cultural Principles:
•We will empower every individual team member and treat each other as partners. 
•We will make having fun a priority. 
•We will hire and retain the best talent.
•We will communicate internally with honesty, transparency, and authenticity, including positive and negative information.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 548 employees, of whom 198 were located in the United States, 260 in India, and 90 in our other offices around the world.
Technology and Development
We expect to continue investing in our technology in order to support efficient and effective ad monetization, which includes maximizing the yield from existing ad impressions and productively adding new ad impressions processed on our platform. We also intend to continue developing innovative capabilities for our customers.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 204 employees engaged in technology and development.
Our technology and development personnel, based in Pune, India, Redwood City, California, and New York, New York, are highly credentialed—33% of the 204 personnel have advanced degrees.

Our Competition
The digital advertising ecosystem is competitive and complex due to a variety of factors. While programmatic header bidding has enabled the purchasing and selling of vast amounts of digital advertising inventory, there now exist significant challenges related to the proliferation of media across platforms, transaction speed, increased costs, transparency, and regulatory requirements. To address these issues at scale for both publishers and buyers, we provide specialized software and hardware infrastructure to optimally power technology-driven transactions. We compete with SSPs like Magnite, smaller private SSPs in markets around the world, as well as divisions of larger companies like Google.
Factors that enable us to effectively compete for ad impressions from publishers include:
•Publisher Trust and Alignment.
•Monetization.
•Innovation.
•Global, Omnichannel Scale.
•Regulatory Compliance.
Factors that enable us to effectively compete for ad spending from buyers include:
•Buyer Alignment.
•Omnichannel Real Time Bidding.
•Transparent business model.
•Inventory quality.
•Efficiency.
While there is direct competition as noted above, our cloud infrastructure is interoperable with the major header bidding software frameworks including open source Prebid, Google’s Open Bidding, Amazon’s Transparent Ad Marketplace, and others. As a result, we are able to gain access to competitors’ ad impressions. 
We have also demonstrated an ability to extend our header bidding infrastructure into a variety of higher-growth ad formats such as mobile web, mobile app, digital video, and most recently OTT/CTV.
We believe that our specialized cloud infrastructure enables us to compete favorably on the factors described above. In addition, we believe that new market entrants would find it difficult to gain direct access to publishers and ad buyers given their limited scale and would face significant costs to integrate with publishers and ad buyers and comply with growing regulatory requirements around the world.
Sales and Marketing
We primarily deploy a self-service model and focus our sales and marketing efforts on supporting, advising, and training our publishers to optimize their usage of our platform. We employ a nimble in-market sales team with expertise in programmatic advertising to attract premium publishers to our platform. New publishers on our platform work closely with our Customer Success team, which handles on-boarding and providing support throughout the publisher relationship life cycle. We have streamlined the on-boarding process through automation and self-service tools.
22


We have dedicated teams focused on new publisher acquisition and existing publisher relationship management. Our Customer Success team, which focuses on existing publishers, is organized and specialized by type of ad format and device and is trained to both maximize the number of integrations with each publisher, and deploy our value added solutions that we provide. Similarly, we have teams focused on new business acquisition and existing partner retention and expansion for advertisers, agencies, and DSPs. These teams focus on onboarding new partners and increasing spend across a variety of ad formats, devices, and geographies.
Our marketing team is focused on achieving thought leadership, educating customers on how to harness programmatic advertising to improve their business, guiding buyers on how to maximize ROI via the PubMatic cloud infrastructure, supporting our sales team, generating new leads and increasing awareness for our brand.
Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal and state statutory and common law rights, foreign laws where applicable, and contractual restrictions. We seek to control access to our proprietary technology by entering into non-disclosure agreements with third parties and disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors.
We consider our trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We currently own two issued U.S. patents, expiring in 2034, relating to online advertising and auction techniques. We also own one issued Japanese patent. We also own trademark registrations and applications for the “PubMatic” name and variants thereof and other product-related marks in the United States and certain foreign countries. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business. In addition to our intellectual property rights, we also consider the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions to be contributors to our success in the marketplace. We believe our platform would be difficult, time consuming, and costly to replicate. We protect our competitive technology position through our ability to execute and deliver new functionality quickly, as well as our continuous development of new intellectual property as we innovate.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.
Privacy and Data
We are subject to laws and regulations governing privacy and the transmission, collection, and use of consumer data. Interest-based advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a consumer’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that consumer, has come under increasing scrutiny by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies, privacy advocates, academics, and commercial interests in the United States and abroad that focus on data protection and consumer privacy. In particular, much of this scrutiny has focused on the use of cookies and other tracking technologies that collect or aggregate information about consumers’ online browsing and mobile app usage activity. Because both our company and our publishers rely upon large volumes of such data collected primarily through cookies and other tracking technologies, it is essential that we monitor legal requirements and other developments in this area, domestically and globally, maintain a robust privacy and security compliance program, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect, how we collect it, with whom we share it, how we use that data to provide our solutions, and the applicable choices we offer consumers.
23


We provide notice through our privacy policies and notices, which can be found on our website at www.pubmatic.com. As stated in our privacy policy, we do not collect information, such as names, addresses or telephone phone numbers, for providing our advertising services that can be used directly to reveal the identity of the underlying individual. We take steps not to collect and store such information (although on occasion, our publishers voluntarily share information of their consumers with us and in such circumstances we require the publishers to have obtained all necessary consents for such sharing). Our advertising and reporting rely on information that does not, on its own, directly reveal the identity of the underlying individuals (and we do not attempt to associate this information with other information that can identify such individuals). We typically do collect and store IP addresses, geo-location information, and device identifiers that are considered personal data or personal information under the privacy laws of some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of current or future data privacy legislation or regulation. The definition of personally identifiable information, personal information, or personal data, varies by jurisdiction and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to avoid violating laws or regulations related to the collection, storage, and use of consumer data. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly against a continuously evolving legal and regulatory landscape, and we have adopted strong data minimization practices that mitigate our compliance risks.
There are also a number of specific laws and regulations governing the collection and use of certain types of consumer data relevant to our business. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) imposes restrictions on the collection and use of data provided by children under the age of 13 by child-directed websites or online services, such as apps, directed to children or any website if the collection of such data is known to the website or app operator. We have taken various steps to implement a system in which our publishers are contractually obligated to either flag or notify us in writing of child-directed websites. When websites are flagged, or we receive notice of such websites, we do not collect personal information, as defined by COPPA, including cookie identifiers that can recognize the same consumer across multiple sites over time, or location information more specific than street and city, on such websites or online services.
Additionally, our compliance with our privacy policy and our general consumer data privacy and security practices are subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and representations or material omissions therein. 
Certain State Attorneys General in the United States may also bring enforcement actions based on comparable state laws or federal laws that permit state-level enforcement. In California, for example, the Attorney General may bring enforcement actions for violations of the CCPA, as modified by the Attorney General’s recently approved enforcement guidelines. We have registered as a data broker in California with the California Attorney General. When we receive bid requests that include an opt-out signal, we do not sell personal information, as defined by the CCPA. We have also adopted the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework, which includes a technical specification to identify consumer signals to opt-out of sale of their data, and have signed the IAB Limited Service Provider Agreement that imposes service provider obligations for certain opted-out bid requests. These IAB frameworks are designed to facilitate compliance with the CCPA although the California Attorney General’s office has not yet approved such frameworks. The CCPA sets forth high potential liabilities for data privacy violations on a per-record basis, and the industry faces an uncertain compliance burden as our partners and publishers work to become compliant with the law. Adding further complexity in California, voters approved a California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will take effect in January 2023. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt-outs for certain uses of sensitive data and sharing of personal data. Likewise, Virginia enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”), which imposes consumer rights processes and requires user consent for certain types of sensitive data, which also takes effect in January 2023. The CDPA also sets forth high potential liabilities for data privacy violations on a per-record basis, and the industry faces an uncertain compliance burden as our partners and publishers work to become compliant with the law in the future.
24


Outside of the United States, our privacy and data practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business. The use and transfer of personal data in member states of the European Union is currently governed under the GDPR, which grants additional rights to consumers about their data, such as deletion and portability, and generally prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the EU, unless the party exporting the data from the EU implements a compliance mechanism designed to ensure that the receiving party will adequately protect such data. We had relied on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework (Privacy Shield framework), to transfer personal data of EU subjects to the United States, but the Privacy Shield framework was recently declared invalid by Court of Justice of the European Union. (“CJEU”) on July 16, 2020. In the same judgement, while the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield framework), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and cast doubt on their future use. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. The use of standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data specifically to the United States remains under review by a number of European data protection supervisory authorities. 
The GDPR sets out higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, which may result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of an enterprise’s global annual revenue. Additionally, when the transition period following Brexit expires at the beginning of 2021, we will also have to comply with the UK GDPR, which will also have the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million (£17 million) or 4% of global turnover. 
Further, the EU is currently in discussions to replace the ePrivacy Directive (commonly called the “Cookie Directive”) with the ePrivacy Regulation that governs the use of technologies that collect, access, and store consumer information and may create additional compliance burdens for us in Europe.
Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation that closely tracks the concepts, obligations, and consumer rights described in the GDPR, including Brazil’s General Data Protection law and Thailand’s Personal Data Protection Act. Some jurisdictions, including Russia and China, have in recent years enacted data localization laws, which require any personal information of citizens of those jurisdictions to be stored and processed on servers located in those jurisdictions. Such laws are gaining momentum and are being enforced by local authorities. 
Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data, including the IAB, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the NAI. Under the requirements of these self-regulatory bodies, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice via our privacy policies about our use of cookies and other technologies to collect consumer data, our collection and use of consumer data to deliver interest-based advertisements, and consumers’ opt-out choices. We also allow consumers to opt-out from the use of data we collect for purposes of interest-based advertising through mechanisms described in our privacy policies available on our website. Some of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to discipline members or participants, which could result in penalties and cause reputational harm. Additionally, some of these bodies might refer violations of their requirements to the Federal Trade Commission or other regulators.
