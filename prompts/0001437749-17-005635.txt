Our Business
 
Our goal is to make life better by delivering sustainable technology-based products that help solve some of the most widespread problems threatening the world's supply of water, food, agriculture, healthcare and energy. We create and refine intellectual property that forms a foundation from which to build and create break-through products and technology for licensure to commercial partners. Our products harness the power of iodine – “Nature’s Best Solution” – to eliminate contaminants that threaten our water, our health and our quality of life. 
 
We invent, patent, prove and partner – to create best-of-class products and technology for commercialization as we build value for our stockholders and deliver benefits to our world. 
 
Invent – Three Platform Technologies
 
We feature three patent protected platform technologies with diverse product opportunities across multiple industries – the Advanced Oxidation System (“AOS”), CupriDyne and Isan. Each features the use of the all-natural iodine molecule. While they all use iodine, they are quite different in terms of the methods by which they exploit the use of iodine and the form and composition of iodine used, and therefore their function and value proposition can be quite different for each commercial application. 
AOS 
 
The AOS is our invention that combines iodine, water filter materials and electricity within a water treatment device. Our AOS generates extremely high oxidation potential within the device to achieve extremely high rates of disinfection to eliminate infectious biological pathogens like Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli, as well as a model virus Bacteriophage T4. It is also able to oxidize and break-down, or otherwise eliminate, soluble organic contaminants like acids, solvents, sulfur compounds, oil and gas by-products, and pharmaceutical by-products commonly found in a wide variety of contaminated water sources. The AOS’ extremely high oxidation potential, generated using extremely low levels of energy is the key.

The term “oxidation potential” refers to the measure of the performance by which an oxidant is able to “break down” a material through removing electrons, and sometimes by the addition of oxygen. Two commonly understood examples of oxidation are: the rusting of a shipyard anchor by salty air, and the breakdown and conversion of wood into ash by fire and oxygen. The key to our AOS is its ability to generate extremely high oxidation potential in a continuous flow device that attacks contaminants in water flowing through it. The extremely high oxidation potential enables the AOS to achieve disinfection performance results that some researchers at the University of Alberta refer to as “unprecedented.” Aside from its measurably superior disinfection rates, the AOS also boasts substantially lower power consumption rates than competing advanced water treatment technologies such as UV, electro-chlorination, or ozonation. For some applications, it is this value proposition that sets the AOS technology above other water treatment options, as the AOS may allow safe and reliable water treatment for a fraction of the cost of its competitors, and may even enable advanced water treatment in applications where it would have otherwise been prohibitively costly. Our AOS embodies a break-through in science which led to BioLargo's co-founding of multi-year research chair whose goal was to solve the contaminated water issues associated with the Canadian Oil Sands at the University of Alberta Department of Engineering in conjunction with the top five oil companies in Canada, the regional water district, and various environmental agencies of the Canadian government. Our work is continually expanding into a number of commercial applications with a key focus on waste-water treatment, food processing, agriculture, and oil and gas. We are also at the early stages of evaluating opportunities in the maritime industry, storm drain recapture / recycling, and drinking water. Our AOS is an award-winning invention that is supported by science and engineering financial support and grants from various federal and provincial funding agencies in Canada. Financial support is expanding concurrently with ongoing work to commercially develop the latest AOS designs. We believe the AOS has an important and substantial commercial opportunity in every segment of the water treatment industry and we believe it should find early market adoption in helping manage waste-water. 
 
Following extensive validation testing and refinement of the basic operating system, we have begun a commercial prototype development project that includes important third party validation studies and the design of tis computer automation system. These next steps lead us to a product ready for commercial markets. The project is being executed in collaboration with technical personnel at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (“NAIT”)'s Center for Sensors and Systems Integration and with NAIT's Applied Bio/Nanotechnology Industrial Research Chair. Bolstered by financial support provided by the Alberta Innovates nanoPDP program, this project is focused on the development of a first-generation prototype system that incorporates a sensor platform to monitor various water parameters through online real-time data acquisition. The first “Alpha” prototype of the AOS was delivered at our annual technical symposium this past August. This Alpha AOS system enables further scale up and testing in industrial settings and work has commenced to develop a “Beta” unit for first stage commercial trials. Once this Beta prototype development phase is complete, we intend to focus on producing multiple commercial ready pilot units for testing with various interested industrial clients and on securing regulatory approvals where required. We are in the process of refining our strategic plan to more narrowly focus our efforts on markets where we believe we can make an important contribution, faster adoption rates, and meaningful economic inroads.
 
Our AOS is being developed as a flexible modular system to allow for a wide variety of sizes, configurations and functional uses to be deployed to meet a wide variety of unique and special requirements of customers across a wide range of industries.
 
In February 2017 Mark Lambert joined our team as a “strategic advisor” to help develop and refine our commercialization plan for AOS. Mr. Lambert has over 25 years of experience as a senior level executive with extensive experience in the water, renewable energy and environmental services industries.

CupriDyne® Technology
 
Our CupriDyne technology is used to efficiently deliver iodine in various products. It can be delivered in any physical form and can be combined with other ingredients, such as fragrances in our odor control products, and surfactants in our stain removal and odor control products. Additional ingredients can often be added without sacrificing its practical and safe functions as well its oxidation potential. Our product designs include liquids, sprays, gels, powders, coatings and absorbents. 
 
Safety and efficacy are key for CupriDyne. Each of our product designs delivers iodine safely, and precisely, to achieve effective odor control, stain-removal, or surface washing, and in some applications at high doses, broad-spectrum disinfection. CupriDyne’s primary ingredients, as well as reaction by-products, are “generally recognized as safe” (“G.R.A.S”) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as food additives in their basic forms. CupriDyne’s commercial product opportunities are diverse and we have an extensive menu of product designs in various stages of commercialization and licensure development, discussed in detail below in the “Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products” section. 
 
We believe CupriDyne is unique. The iodine most of us are familiar with, sold in pharmacies and used by hospitals, has severe limitations – it is considered toxic, causes staining and contains a limited dose of the active oxidizing ingredient. Our CupriDyne technology, on the other hand, directly addresses many of these shortcomings – it delivers iodine’s oxidizing ingredient (“free iodine”) with precision, ranging from very small doses up to very large doses with more than 30 times the performance of chlorine. We can deliver iodine that is both non-toxic and non-staining, thus extending its usefulness well beyond historical product applications. 
 
Our CupriDyne technology is flexible, allowing product designs to incorporate varying dosing levels. Some product designs focus on odor, and do not act as "disinfectants". Some product designs do, and would require regulatory approval to make such claims.
 
Isan System
 
The Isan System is a reliable and efficient automated iodine dosing system. It is the winner of a Top 50 Water Technology Award by the Artemis Project and a Dupont Innovation Award. Its precise dosing combined with a straight-forward “set-it-and-forget-it” automated computer controlled system are the keys to its success. The system features controlled measuring, flow rate, dosing and iodine extraction/removal technology as well as an automatic tracking system that precisely delivers iodine in calibrated doses into a water steam or container of water. The Isan system has been proven to substantially reduce the incidence of fungal growth, spoilage, microorganisms and pathogens in water and on food. The system is capable of functioning at the high flow rates commensurate with industrial disinfection needs. 
 
First developed in Australia, the Isan system was initially registered with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (“APVMA”) and Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (“FSANZ”) in Australia and New Zealand. The system has meaningful applications and commercial value in any industry that can benefit from precise and effecting dosing of iodine in water, such as: agriculture, food production and processing, manufacturing, industrial water processes and irrigation supply.

Partner – a Smart Strategic Decision 
 
We seek to develop commercial partnerships with other companies who will partner with us and pay us for a negotiated contractual right to use our intellectual property (patents, formulas, designs, claims, know-how, secrets) in order to expand their business for their own commercial purposes. In those instances, we seek a reasonable deposit, a minimum commitment to volume, some territorial rights and a percentage of sales for a mutually agreeable term and territory. We believe this licensing model will prove successful and meaningful for our company. 
 
We have chosen to focus on business opportunities that we believe have some combination of the following attributes: a compelling commercial advantage, our products out-perform competing products, market segments in which we have the talent and resources or opportunity to succeed in executing our business plans and uses where we can identify a compelling cost savings or value offering to increase market share.
 
We choose to pursue a licensing strategy for its obvious and well-understood high margins, potential for explosive revenue potential and capital conserving features. While this business model can also be highly dependent upon macro-economic factors like the relative stability of the national and international economy as well as the cyclical nature of business, politics and climate for innovation and competing technical advances, we believe this is the most appropriate strategy for our company. When our commercial licensing partners are under financial pressure from macro-economic and political circumstances, including reorganizations, recapitalization or consolidation, they hold on to capital and are less likely to take any risk for new product offerings. 

While we have waited out many of the uncertainties of the macro-economic marketplace, we have advanced our commercial purposes and made investments in various aspects of product design, marketing and distribution, but only at an early stage and small level. In those instances, we consider these efforts to be a prelude to an ultimate licensing strategy. This strategy also requires that we create and maintain a strong and defensible position relative to our intellectual property and proof of claims. We are diligent in this area as we have continued advancing our science and its related intellectual property. This strategy is exacting and deliberate. It has been slower than we prefer. However, it has created a substantial level of diversification and breadth of potential revenue streams that we believe can and will generate meaningful revenues as they find traction in the marketplace. As we improve our access to capital, strengthen our balance sheet and can begin to generate meaningful cash flow, we believe those commercial opportunities will generate revenue for years to come as our products find their way into the marketplace.
 
In many situations, our potential licensing partners would prefer that we advance products all the way through proof of claim, manufacturing, market acceptance, well-established distribution and commercial success. While this is obvious, can be intriguing, and the relative benefits that would accrue to our valuation are clear, the risks of failure are equally high, and this strategy would require substantially more capital than we have been able to secure during what many believe has been one of the most economically uncertain times in modern history. Therefore, we have chosen to invest our time and resources where we find leverage to move forward, knowing that our technical claims are proven, they are patented and that each product design has a high probability of success to find a partner and generate meaningful returns on our invested capital as our targeted licensing partners seek to deploy capital assets and begin taking advantage of our offering for their own commercial advancements.

Although our technology has commercial applications within many industries, we are focusing our efforts in four areas: water treatment; industrial odor control applications; commercial, household and personal care products (“CHAPP”); and “advanced wound care.”
 
Within these broad categories, we also narrow our product focus to exploit opportunities that we believe are of high value to potential customers and that present commercially significant opportunities.
 
We have a number of examples of strategic alliance or partnering initiatives whereby we are advancing both our science, our patents, our proof of claims, field trials and our commercial opportunities. There are a number of noteworthy examples: 
 
The University of Alberta
 
We are engaged in a cooperative research relationship with the University of Alberta and its researchers in Edmonton, Canada. The offices and lab of our Canadian subsidiary, BioLargo Water, Inc., and our staff researchers, are located within the University of Alberta research center at Agri-Food Discovery Place. We are able to utilize the extensive resources of the University and its researchers on a contract for hire basis as needed. We work closely with the Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science at the University of Alberta and its Department of Engineering, and partner with University professors on government and industry sponsored financial awards and grants to support our ongoing research and development as we refine the AOS in preparation of commercial pilots and commercial designs. We have received over 30 grants thus far. Generally, the financial awards take on two common themes: first, science and engineering grants in which the University of Alberta is the primary recipient and contracting party with the grant agency to support work on and around our technology; and second, direct grants in which our Canadian subsidiary is the contracting party to support ongoing science and engineering to advance our AOS towards commercialization, sometimes supporting the work of PhD students at the University. In both cases, the financial awards support much, but not all, of the research budget and related costs. Our research arrangement with the University has three high value propositions for BioLargo: (i) a depth of resources and talent to accomplish highly skilled work, (ii) financial aid to support research and development costs and (iii) independent and credible validation of our technical claims. Grant revenue recorded by BioLargo totaled $161,430 during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Clarion Water
 
On August 18, 2014, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution license agreement for our Isan® system with Clarion Water, a new operating division of InsulTech Manufacturing, LLC (www.insultech.com), the latter of which has over 20 years of commercial success around the globe representing hundreds of millions in sales of technical products to Fortune 100 companies.
 
Owned in equal parts by BioLargo, Inc. and Peter Holdings, Ltd. through a joint venture agreement, the Isan system leverages the power of iodine to provide the world’s most effective disinfection dosing systems. It has been referred to as one of the most important technical advancements in food safety in the past 20 years. It won a “top 50 water company award” by the Artemis Project in 2010 and a DuPont Innovation Award for its excellence in science and innovation in 2004.

Per the terms of our license agreement, Clarion initially received the exclusive global manufacturing and distribution rights to the Isan system and use of all historical data to support its commercial focus. Clarion is obligated to pay BioLargo royalties on revenue equal to 10% paid quarterly in arrears. As we jointly own the Isan System with Peter Holdings, Ltd., any royalties we receive would be shared equally with Peter Holdings, Ltd. There were no minimum royalty payments for the first two years, but at year three (beginning July 1, 2016), to continue with exclusive rights, the minimum royalties were $50,000 per quarter, at year four $75,000 per quarter, and at year five and onward $100,000 per quarter. Clarion has elected not to make these minimum payments. The intellectual property subject to the license agreement includes all intellectual property related to the Isan System, including all patents, trademarks, proprietary knowledge and other similar know-how or rights relating to or arising out of the Isan System or the patents related to the Isan System. The agreement contains other terms and conditions typically found in intellectual property license agreements.
 
BioLargo received a royalty advance of $100,000 upon execution of a letter of intent in February of 2014. Of this advance, $45,000 was paid to Peter Holdings, Ltd. under our joint venture agreement. BioLargo retains certain marketing rights to help develop clients for Clarion.
 
Since licensing the technology from BioLargo, Clarion completed a comprehensive technical and engineering update to the Isan System, featuring a new automated touch screen user interface, enhanced security, enhanced control features for increased monitoring and sensing, and adding automated functionality providing users unmatched flexibility, reliability and control over this state-of-the-art disinfectant delivery system, and begun commercial trials. In 2016, it received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use of Isan generated iodine, “BioMax A”, as it is delivered in poultry drinking water. Clarion has begun the process of expanding the approved uses under its EPA registration. 

Clarion continues to pursue commercial opportunities for the Isan system. They have recently identified two distributors to work with directly to establish sales and customer trials. BioLargo and Peter Holdings have agreed to cooperate as Clarion more precisely narrows its commercial focus. Clarion has further offered to serve as a manufacturer of the Isan system for business opportunities that may develop for BioLargo in the future. While it narrows its commercial focus, Clarion has determined not to make further minimum payments under the license agreement and is operating on a non-exclusive basis. This election does not affect Clarion’s obligation to pay royalties on sales. 
 
Downeast Logistics
 
In late 2013, we entered into a cooperative selling and distribution agreement with Downeast Logistics, a certified “Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business” (SDVOSB), as our distribution partner to facilitate our first order to the US Government. Downeast has been instrumental in developing ongoing sales to the United States Military. We have six products with unique “National Stocking Numbers.” 
 
In March 2016, two of our product lines (consisting of 9 SKUs) of Nature’s Best Science products were awarded a five-year U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) supply contract, under schedule 65IIA for medical equipment and supplies. The award opens up access to these products through “GSA Advantage,” the online shopping and ordering system that provides government agencies access to thousands of contractors and millions of supplies (products) and services. We intend to apply for inclusion of additional existing and future products into GSA Advantage, including our industrial odor control product, CupriDyne Clean. In December of 2016 these same product lines as well as our CupriDyne Clean Industrial Odor Eliminator were accepted to the DOD eMALL which is another purchasing portal for the Defense Department and other State and Federal agencies. As of this date our products are approved for sale and available to all branches of government at the federal, state and local levels through 5 different purchasing portals.

Industrial Odor Control - CupriDyne Clean
 
In 2015 and 2016 we were invited by a number of potential customers to design a product for the industrial odor control industry segment and to begin trials for an odor control product in large-scale operations. As a result of these efforts, we have branded a product “CupriDyne Clean”, a non-staining and colorless blend of micronutrients designed for odor control. CupriDyne Clean has proven extremely effective at oxidizing volatile organic compounds (gases), while maintaining its low cost, safety and easy to use features. It is dispensed through atomization systems, portable sprayers and water trucks. CupriDyne Clean is highly effective at eliminating odorous gases, and is safe for use on a host of surfaces including the air, soils, metals, concrete and asphalt, docks, floors, walls, feed and water receptacles, waste receptacles, tanks, bins, liners and dumpsters. It can be delivered with or without fragrances since fragrances are not required for it to achieve odor elimination. The product is available in liquids and powders offered in various sizes for industrial uses and is ideal for waste transfer stations, composting facilities, landfill operations, sewage plants and lift stations, food processing plants and animal enclosures. In principle, any operations that must contend with gaseous odors generated from organic matter and decay, including the natural release of VOCs from this decay, can benefit by using CupriDyne Clean. Existing and prospective customers, as well as experts from these markets, tell us that effective odor control for these prospective customer groups is among the top on a list of priorities in their daily operations and their commitment to serve their local communities where they operate. Our biggest challenge to increasing market share is the challenge of overcoming customer’s disbelief that any product, including ours, can actually eliminate the odors inherent in the waste handling industry. We are pursuing a multi-faceted marketing and sales program.

We continue to further develop and refine our customer trial program, attend industry conferences, join trade associations, advertise, and recruit leaders from these industries to help us refine, focus and break through to commercial success. We unconditionally guarantee each sale for complete satisfaction by the customer. In May 2016, we secured our first orders for CupriDyne Clean for the use at a Southern California waste handling facility. During the remainder of 2016 we conducted multiple customer trials with local, regional and national companies and municipalities in the waste handling industry. We continue to schedule customer trials in 2017 and we have expanded our marketing efforts to include environmental engineering and consulting firms that are active serving the waste and remediation industry. We now have multiple customers and continue to develop new agents and distributor relationships. We have applied for approved vendor status and have presented national purchasing agreements to multiple large corporate accounts. We are engaged in top-down and bottom up selling. We believe these relationships, and their ultimate successful creation, are critical to the long-term, commercial success of CupriDyne Clean. The response from our trial work with potential customers tell us that the product works better than any product they have used and is cost effective. They all indicate a desire to purchase and use the product. As exciting and validating as these trials are, we are still required to navigate what can sometimes be a time consuming and laborious task to bring trial customers into a final completed purchase order, especially with the larger multi-national customers and municipalities. These efforts are time consuming and continuing. We remain confident that our product is the top performing odor eliminator for the industry and its value proposition compelling.
 
Multinationals and Mid-Level Industry Participants
 
We held our first technical symposium held in August 2015 where we had more than 30 attendees representing industry, academia and funding agencies. We held a second technical symposium in August of 2016 to showcase the refinements to the technology, data showing efficacy, our “Alpha” AOS, and our first commercial prototype being designed and assembled by the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. We have entered into technical non-disclosure agreements with multi-national and regional companies to evaluate AOS and discuss potential strategic alliances. Many of these companies have expressed interest in our technology as we finalize our commercial ready design. The technical claims we have put forth are well received. The focus of discussions in most cases has moved from efficacy, which is accepted, to a business case discussion relative to capital and time to market and the potential return on investment. While these discussions are ongoing, we continue to advance our science and proven claims. We are currently evaluating a number of waste-water treatment projects where our technology can be useful. We are highly encouraged that AOS has an important role in commerce.

Strategic Alliances and Engineering Support 
 
In October 2016 we engaged Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) to support implementation of our AOS and provide independent performance verification. In February of 2017 CB&I announced that they would be selling the business unit with whom we are working to Veritas Capital. This transition is likely to delay our work. In late 2016 we established a relationship with Carollo Engineering, one of the largest engineering firms in the United States dedicated solely to water related engineering. We are working with Carollo to provide independent third party oversight of some initial demonstration testing of AOS for potential municipal and food industry clients.
Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products
 
CHAPP includes broad product categories and many opportunities for the application of our technologies. It is defined by the ability to utilize similar, if not identical, consumption products in multiple market segments. Detergents, single use absorbents, wipes, products that provide odor or infection control and stain removal all fall within this category. Packaging ranges from consumer sizes of a few ounces to bulk packaging for commercial or industrial use. We are currently marketing products in this category under four brands – Odor-No-More, Nature’s Best Solution, Deodorall and NBS. Our primary product offerings include an animal-bedding additive that controls odor and moisture. We also sell liquid odor control products to private label (aka ‘White Label’) customers who then in turn sell product to consumers and industrial clients.
 
We are continuing our efforts to generate additional “private label” clients. We have fulfilled some small orders for various products that we produced under a third party’s private brand. We continue to meet with new potential customers for private label opportunities. We also have relationships and remain in discussions with potential strategic partners to provide large scale manufacturing and distribution should we secure orders for the private label business opportunities or experience a rapid increase in any product whereby we need to supplement manufacturing to meet client delivery needs. Success in these markets is highly dependent upon the willingness of the potential partners to invest in product support to continue marketing and expanding customer awareness. 
 
Our sales in the CHAPP product category are nominal. Product development, sales and marketing require significant financial resources that we currently have elected to invest elsewhere while, also, limiting our risk in these highly competitive and commodity markets. As such, our progress in this area has been slower than we had hoped. As opportunities present themselves, we market our technology for licensure to established companies in this industry segment. We rely upon independent agents and key industry contacts for this activity and it is not a top priority. We continue to expand our proof of claims and product designs for various odor and moisture control applications. We believe this segment will enjoy commercial success only after we prove the market viability for our CupriDyne Clean product. Therefore, we are more narrowly focused on the business to business sales and marketing activity to help gain exposure and build credibility for our consumer product designs and technology.

BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc.

We formed BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc. to organize and evaluate business opportunities in and around the maritime industry for our technologies, including our AOS. We intend to move forward as we are actively developing key relationships with people, service organizations, suppliers and trade groups that serve this industry. We believe the various opportunities in this market would require the services and support from a company like CB&I. We will need to organize a strategy and additional resources, including capital and proper staffing, to pursue business opportunities. This subsidiary is not yet operational.
Advanced Wound Care – Clyra Medical Technologies Subsidiary
 
In 2012 we formed Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. (“Clyra”) to commercialize our technology in the medical products industry, with an initial focus on advanced wound care. Our advanced wound care products combine broad-spectrum antimicrobial capabilities with iodine’s natural and well-understood metabolic pathway to promote healing. Our products are highly differentiated by the gentle nature in which they can perform. We believe these benefits, along with its non-staining feature and reduced product costs as compared with other antimicrobials, give our products a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
 
In December 2015, we completed a financing transaction through which $750,000 was invested into Clyra in exchange for preferred stock comprising 40% of the total issued and outstanding shares. The investor committed to fund a $5,000,000 operating line of credit once Clyra’s initial products receive FDA approval. (Details regarding this transaction are below.) 

With new funding in place, Clyra re-initiated product development and testing for its wound treatment products with experts and well-established contract manufacturing companies from industry. It has successfully formulated multiple product designs that its believes can meet the tests required for FDA approval and are working to conclude those technical validations now. It intends to apply for FDA 510(k) approval as soon as product development is complete. While no assurances can be made about the ultimate success any FDA applications once filed, Clyra has retained and engaged a team of experts in the area to guide it through the process.  In the interim, Clyra will continue to refine product roll out, marketing, and distribution plans. Given the timing of the FDA process, and the requirement for approval before product can be sold, management does not anticipate product sales until late 2017 or early 2018. We recently filed two patent applications based on Clyra’s further development work. We are also evaluating potential product designs where our current product designs can be used or slightly modified or enhanced to create new products for new medical related markets like dental, veterinary medicine, and over the counter applications. 
 
Stock Purchase Agreement – Clyra Medical
 
On December 30, 2015, Clyra sold 9,830 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock (“Preferred Shares”) to Sanatio Capital, LLC (“Sanatio”) for $750,000. Sanatio is beneficially owned by Jack B. Strommen. This sale was made in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder as not involving a public offering of securities. Because of the sale, Sanatio owns 40% of Clyra’s issued and outstanding shares, BioLargo owns 54%, and the remainder is owned by management.

As set forth in Clyra’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Preferred Shares accrue an annual dividend of 8% for a period of five years. Although the dividends begin to accrue immediately, Clyra has no obligation to declare a dividend until a product of Clyra has received a premarket approval by the United States Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”), or for which a premarket notification pursuant to form 510(k) has been submitted and for which the FDA has given written clearance to market the product in the United States (either, “FDA Approval”). After FDA Approval, annually on December 20, and unless prohibited by California law governing distributions to shareholders, Clyra is required to declare and pay any accruing dividends to holders of Preferred Shares then accrued but unpaid.
 
Holders of Preferred Shares are entitled to preferential payments in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Clyra, in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. After such preference, any remaining assets are distributed pro-rata between holders of Clyra common stock and Preferred Shares as if the Preferred Shares had converted to common stock. Holders of Preferred Shares may convert the shares to common stock initially on a one-to-one basis. The conversion formula is subject to change in the event Clyra sells stock at a lower price than the price paid by Sanatio.
 
In addition to the $750,000 investment, once Clyra receives FDA Approval for a product, Sanatio has agreed to provide Clyra a $5,000,000 credit facility for operating, warehouse, inventory and costs necessary to rapidly expand sales (“Line of Credit”). Terms of the Line of Credit are to be negotiated in good faith, be commercially reasonable and mutually agreeable to the parties. Should Sanatio fail to provide the Line of Credit, BioLargo has the right to do so under similar terms and conditions offered to Sanatio, and neither Clyra nor any of its shareholders, affiliates, successors or assigns will have any recourse or remedies against Sanatio for failing to provide the Line of Credit. If either BioLargo or an entity not affiliated with Sanatio provides the Line of Credit (either directly, through an affiliate, or third party), Clyra shall issue such lender a warrant to purchase an amount of Clyra common stock equal to 10% of Clyra’s capital stock on a fully-diluted basis, at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Clyra’s common stock on the date of issuance, as determined by its board of directors in good faith.
 
Clyra Shareholder Agreement
 
BioLargo, Santatio and other Clyra shareholders entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed to elect a three-member board of directors, consisting of Clyra’s president, BioLargo’s president, and a Sanatio representative, who shall initially be Mr. Strommen. The shareholders also agreed to restrict the sale of any stock in Clyra unless all holders of Preferred Shares are allowed to participate in such transaction and the consideration received pursuant to such transaction is allocated among the parties thereto in the manner specified in its articles of incorporation in effect immediately prior to the sale.
Amendment to Clyra License Agreement
 
By agreement dated December 30, 2015, BioLargo and Clyra amended (the “Amendment”) the December 17, 2012 License Agreement (“License Agreement”) by which BioLargo licensed to Clyra the exclusive world-wide right to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products for use within the field of human wound care (as defined in the agreement), expandable to include other medical products. The Amendment changes the events that trigger Clyra’s obligation to begin the $50,000 monthly “initial license fee” payments such that no such payments are due until both (i) a Clyra product has received FDA approval and (ii) Clyra has generated $4,000,000 in gross annual revenue. Additionally, the Amendment updated the licensed patents to include recently issued European patents, confirmed that the Sanatio investment transaction was not a “default” under the License Agreement, and that Sanatio was made an express third party beneficiary of the agreement.

Investors’ Rights Agreement

BioLargo entered into an “investors’ rights agreements” with Sanatio and Strommen whereby BioLargo committed to file a Form S-1 or S-3 registration statement for all registrable securities issued to investors in connection with BioLargo’s 2015 Unit Offering, and an additional 1,000,000 shares of BioLargo common stock that may be issued to Sanatio or Strommen in the future, if circumstances arise for such payment obligations. The agreement also provides Sanatio and Strommen “piggy back” registration rights. 
 
Additionally, BioLargo granted to Strommen a “right of first refusal” to purchase its holdings in Clyra should it choose to sell those holdings and a right of “co-sale” in the event such shares are sold to a third party.
 
Strommen Consulting Agreement
 
In addition to the foregoing, Clyra entered into a consulting agreement with Beach House Consulting, LLC, through which Jack B. Strommen will be providing consulting services to Clyra. Mr. Strommen is a founder and leader of PD Instore (www.pdinstore.com), works with some of the world’s leading retailers, and has overseen many national ground-breaking marketing rollouts and initiatives. Mr. Strommen will be assisting Clyra in its sales and marketing activities once it has FDA Approval on a product, at which point the agreement provides that Mr. Strommen is to receive $23,437.50 per month for a period of four years.
Intellectual Property
 
Patent - an Expanding Intellectual Property Estate

We have 15 patents issued and multiple pending. We believe these patents provide a foundation from which to continue building our patent portfolio, and we believe that our technology is sufficiently useful and novel that we have a reasonable basis upon which to rely on our patent protections. We also rely on trade secrets and technical know-how to establish and maintain additional protection of our intellectual property. As our capital resources permit, we expect to expand our patent protection as we continue to refine our inventions as well as make new discoveries. See the detailed discussion below of our patent portfolio.
 
We regard our intellectual property as critical to our ultimate success. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products and technologies in geographic areas of commercial interest and to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information through laws and contractual arrangements. 
 
Our Chief Science Officer, Mr. Kenneth R. Code, has been involved in the research and development of the technology since 1997. He has participated in the Canadian Federal Scientific Research and Experimental Development program, and he was instrumental in the discovery, preparation and filing of the first technology patents. He has worked with manufacturers, distributors and suppliers in a wide variety of industries to gain a full appreciation of the potential applications and the methodologies applicable to our technology for their manufacture and performance. He continues to research methods and applications to continue to expand the potential uses of our technology as well as work to uncover new discoveries that may provide additional commercial applications to help solve real world problems in the field of disinfection.

In 2015 and 2016, we continued improving our technology and creating new uses of our technology through further research and development efforts. During that time, we filed two U.S. patent applications, each comprised of multiple individual claims, and received notice of allowance or were granted five patents by the USPTO. Our technology also includes know-how and trade secrets, which, together with our intellectual property, contribute to our expertise in product design, manufacturing, product claims, safety features and competitive positioning of products that feature our technology. 
 
During 2017 we plan to continue to advance our proof of claims, inventions and patent filings.

We incurred $684,554 in 2015 and $1,381,956 in 2016 in expense related to our research and development activities. Our research and development expenditures in 2017 could vary significantly and will depend upon our access to capital. Although we are actively pursuing such financing, no such commitment is yet in place. 
 
We believe that our suite of intellectual property covers the presently targeted major areas of focus for our licensing strategy. The description of our intellectual property, at present, is as follows:

Pending Patent Applications 

Most recently, we filed two patent applications in the United States for our advanced wound care formulas. The inventions in these applications form the basis for the work at Clyra Medical and the products for which that subsidiary intends to seek FDA approval. In addition to these applications, we have filed patent applications in multiple foreign countries, including the European Union, pursuant to the PCT, and other provisional applications. 
 
Subject to adequate financing, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our suite of intellectual property through ongoing focus on product development, new intellectual property development and patent applications, and further third-party testing and validations for specific areas of focus for commercial exploitation. We currently anticipate that additional patent applications will be filed during the next 12 months with the USPTO and the PCT, although we are uncertain of the cost of such patent filings, which will depend upon the number of such applications prepared and filed. The expense associated with seeking patent rights in multiple foreign countries is expensive and will require substantial ongoing capital resources. However, we cannot give any assurance that adequate capital will be available. Without adequate capital resources, we will be forced to abandon patent applications and irrevocably lose rights to our technologies.
