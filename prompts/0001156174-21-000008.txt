ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is a South Dakota limited liability company that owns and manages an ethanol plant that has a nameplate production capacity of 90 million gallons of ethanol per year through its wholly-owned subsidiary Dakota Ethanol, L.L.C. The ethanol plant currently produces at rates in excess of 90 million gallons of ethanol per year. The ethanol plant is located near Wentworth, South Dakota. Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC is referred to in this report as "LACP," the "Company," "we," or "us." Dakota Ethanol, L.L.C. is referred to in this report as "Dakota Ethanol" or the "ethanol plant." 
Since September 4, 2001, we have been engaged in the production of ethanol and distillers grains. Fuel grade ethanol is our primary product accounting for the majority of our revenue.  We also sell distillers grains and corn oil, the principal co-products of the ethanol production process. 
The ethanol industry experienced industry-wide record low ethanol prices throughout most of 2018 and 2019 due to reduced demand and high industry inventory levels. This continued into 2020 and the situation was compounded by the crisis associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”). In response to these unfavorable operating conditions and a slowdown in global and regional economic activity and a disruption in transportation fuel demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our ethanol production rate early in 2020 which impacted our total ethanol production for our 2020 fiscal year.
General Development of Business
LACP was formed as a South Dakota cooperative on May 25, 1999. On August 20, 2002, our members approved a plan to reorganize into a South Dakota limited liability company. The reorganization became effective on August 31, 2002, and the assets and liabilities of the cooperative were transferred to the newly formed limited liability company. Following the reorganization, our legal name was changed to Lake Area Corn Processors, LLC.
Our ownership of Dakota Ethanol represents our primary asset and source of revenue. Since we operate Dakota Ethanol as a wholly-owned subsidiary, all net income generated by Dakota Ethanol is passed to LACP. We make distributions of the income received from Dakota Ethanol to our unit holders in proportion to the number of units held by each member.
We entered into a loan agreement with the Small Business Association through First State Bank, Gothenburg, NE on April 4, 2020 for $760,400 as part of the Paycheck Protection Program under Division A, Title I of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The loan matures in January 2023 and has an interest rate of 1%. Proceeds of the loan are restricted for use towards payroll costs and other allowable uses such as covered utilities for incurred before December 31, 2020 under the Paycheck Protection Program Rules. Provisions of the agreement allow for a portion of the loan to be forgiven if certain qualifications are met. We applied for forgiveness of this loan. The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which was put into effect on June 5, 2020, may effect the terms of our loan. 
On June 5, 2020, we entered into a Third Amendment to our credit agreement with Farm Credit Services of America, PCA and Farm Credit Services of America, FLCA ("Farm Credit") (the "Third Amendment"). Under the Third Amendment, the available credit under the revolving operating note was reduced to $2,000,000 and the available credit on the reducing revolving note was increased to $48,000,000. The working capital covenant was reduced to $11,000,000 and the net worth covenant was reduced to $18,000,0000. The next measurement date for the debt service coverage ratio was deferred until December 31, 2021. The annual installment on the term note for 2020 was deferred until maturity in 2025. The interest rates were unchanged.    
    During our 2019 fiscal year, we completed a plant expansion project which expanded our production capacity to approximately 90 million gallons of ethanol per year. The cost of the expansion was approximately $36 million. As a result of the plant expansion project, results of prior years may be materially different from future years. 
Financial Information
Please refer to "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information regarding our results of operations and "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for our audited consolidated financial statements. 
Principal Products
The principal products produced at the ethanol plant are fuel grade ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributed to each of our primary products for each of our last three fiscal years. 

Product | Fiscal Year 2020 | Fiscal Year 2019 | Fiscal Year 2018
Ethanol | 76% | 78% | 77% 
Distillers Grains | 20% | 18% | 20% 
Corn Oil | 4% | 4% | 3% 

Ethanol
Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains. Ethanol is primarily used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. Ethanol produced in the United States is primarily used for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products. Ethanol blended fuel is typically designated in the marketplace according to the percentage of the fuel that is ethanol, with the most common fuel blend being E10, which includes 10% ethanol. The United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has approved the use of gasoline blends that contain 15% ethanol, or E15, for use in all vehicles manufactured in model year 2001 and later. In addition, flexible fuel vehicles can use gasoline blends that contain up to 85% ethanol called E85.
An ethanol plant is essentially a fermentation plant. Ground corn and water are mixed with enzymes and yeast to produce a substance called "beer," which contains approximately 15% alcohol, 11% solids and 74% water. The "beer" is boiled to separate the water, resulting in ethyl alcohol, which is then dehydrated to increase the alcohol content. This product is then mixed with a certified denaturant, such as gasoline, to make the product unfit for human consumption which allows it to be sold commercially.
Distillers Grains
A principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy and beef industry. We primarily produce distillers grains in two forms, modified/wet distillers grains and dried distillers grains. Modified/wet distillers grains have a higher moisture content than dried distillers grains. Our modified/wet distillers grains are sold primarily in our local market because they have a shorter shelf life and are more expensive to transport than dried distillers grains. 
Corn Oil
We separate a portion of the corn oil contained in our distillers grains which we market separately from our distillers grains. The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. The primary uses for the corn oil that we produce are animal feed, industrial uses and biodiesel production.
Principal Product Markets
    Ethanol
    The primary market for our ethanol is the domestic fuel blending market. However the ethanol industry has focused on increasing ethanol exports. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Brazil, Canada, India and Mexico were top destinations for ethanol exports in 2020. However, overall exports of ethanol for this period decreased compared to the same period last year due to escalating trade barriers and the impacts of COVID-19. Tariffs implemented by Brazil and China on ethanol imported from the United States reduced export demand from these markets. Trade barriers with key markets may continue to take a toll on ethanol export demand negatively effecting domestic ethanol prices. Ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate throughout the year as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. An example of this, the imposition of a tax on imported ethanol by Brazil has created uncertainty as to the viability of that market for ethanol produced in the United States and has required the United States producers to seek out other markets for their products. While Brazil still imports a significant amount of ethanol from the United States, these imports could be higher without these trade barriers.
Export demand has also decreased due to the disruption in global fuel demand resulting from travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restricted travel, new lockdown measures and slow economic growth continue to have a negative effect on global fuel consumption and it is unknown when such demand will recover as reopening efforts continue to evolve.

    Ethanol is generally blended with gasoline before it is sold to the end consumer. Therefore, the primary purchasers of ethanol are fuel blending companies which mix the ethanol we produce with gasoline. As discussed below in the section entitled "Distribution of Principal Products," we have a third party marketer that sells all of our ethanol. Our ethanol marketer makes substantially all decisions regarding where our ethanol is sold.
Distillers Grains
    Distillers grains are primarily used as animal feed. Distillers grains are typically fed to animals instead of other traditional animal feeds such as corn and soybean meal. Distillers grains exports have increased in recent years as distillers grains have become a more accepted animal feed. Currently, the United States ethanol industry exports a significant amount of distiller grains. According to the U.S. Grains Council, during the 2019/2020 marketing year, the largest importers of United States distiller grains were Mexico, China, Canada, Japan, Colombia and South Korea.
During 2016, China began an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation related to distillers grains imported from the United States which contributed to a decline in distillers grains shipped to China. In January 2017, the Chinese finalized the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. The anti-dumping duties range from 42.2% to 53.7%, and the final anti-subsidy tariffs range from 11.2% to 12%. The trade actions taken by the Chinese have resulted in further declines in distillers grains demand and prices. The significant reduction in distillers grains exports to China requires United States distillers grains producers to seek out alternative markets.
    We anticipate that the vast majority of our distillers grains will continue to be sold in the domestic market due to our plant's location. Further, management anticipates that we will continue to sell a large proportion of our distillers grains in the modified/wet form which is marketed locally. 
    Corn Oil
    The primary markets for corn oil are the industrial chemicals market, animal feeding market and the biodiesel production market. The biodiesel blenders' tax credit expired at the end of 2017. However, on December 20, 2019, the biodiesel blenders' tax credit was reinstated retroactively for 2018 and 2019 after it expired at the end of 2017, and a forward looking extension was included for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Since corn oil can be used as a feedstock to produce biodiesel, when biodiesel production increases it has a positive impact on corn oil prices. However, additional corn oil supply has continued to enter the market which has impacted corn oil prices. The market for corn oil is expected to continue to shift as changes in supply and demand of corn oil interact. Our corn oil is primarily marketed in the United States and we do not expect that significant exports of corn oil will occur in the near future.
Distribution of Principal Products
Ethanol Distribution
    We have an ethanol marketing agreement with RPMG, Inc. ("RPMG"), a professional third party marketer, which is the sole marketer of our ethanol. We are an equity owner of Renewable Products Marketing Group, LLC ("RPMG, LLC"), the parent company of RPMG, which allows us to realize favorable marketing fees in the sale of our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Our ethanol marketing agreement provides that we can sell our ethanol either through an index arrangement or at a fixed price agreed to between us and RPMG. The term of our ethanol marketing agreement is perpetual, until it is terminated according to the terms of the agreement. The primary reasons our ethanol marketing agreement would terminate are if we cease to be an owner of RPMG, LLC, if there is a breach of our ethanol marketing agreement which is not cured, or if we give advance notice to RPMG that we wish to terminate our ethanol marketing agreement. Notwithstanding our right to terminate our ethanol marketing agreement, we may be obligated to continue to market our ethanol through RPMG for a period of time after termination. Further, following termination we agreed to accept an assignment of certain railcar leases which RPMG has secured to service our ethanol sales. If our ethanol marketing agreement is terminated, it would trigger a redemption by RPMG, LLC of our ownership interest in RPMG, LLC.
Distillers Grains Distribution
Other than the distillers grains that we market locally without a third party marketer, our distillers grains are marketed by RPMG. Our distillers grains marketing agreement with RPMG automatically renews for additional one-year terms unless notice of termination is given as provided by the distillers grains marketing agreement. We pay RPMG a commission based on each ton of distillers grains sold by RPMG.
We market a portion of our distillers grains to our local market without the use of an external marketer. Currently, we market approximately 62%, based on volume, of our distillers grains internally. Shipments of these products are made to local markets by truck. This has allowed us to sell less distillers grains in the form of dried distillers grains which has decreased our natural gas usage and improved our margins from the sale of distillers grains. 
Corn Oil Distribution
We market all of our corn oil through RPMG. Our corn oil marketing agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives 180 days notice that the agreement will not be renewed. We pay RPMG a commission based on each pound of our corn oil that is sold by RPMG. 
New Products and Services 
    We did not introduce any new products or services during our 2020 fiscal year.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
    We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by Broin and Associates, Inc. ("Broin"), the company that designed and built the ethanol plant, to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by Broin was included in the amount we paid Broin to design and build our ethanol plant. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Corn Feedstock Supply
The major raw material required for our ethanol plant to produce ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil is corn.  The plant operates at a rate in excess of its nameplate capacity of 90 million gallons of ethanol per year. We anticipate using approximately 31 million bushels of corn.  The area surrounding the ethanol plant usually provides an ample supply of corn to meet and exceed our raw material requirements for the production capacity of the plant.
Corn prices have been volatile in recent years due to changes in corn demand as well as yield and production fluctuations that have had a significant impact on corn prices. High corn prices have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. We could experience a drought or other unfavorable weather conditions during our 2021 fiscal year which could impact the price we pay for corn and could negatively impact the availability of corn near our plant. If we experience a localized shortage of corn, we may be forced to purchase corn from producers located farther away from our ethanol plant which can increase our transportation costs. In addition, if new corn customers enter the market, it can increase demand for corn which could result in higher corn prices. Since corn is the primary raw material we use to produce our products, the availability and cost of corn can have a significant impact on the profitability of our operations.
Corn is supplied to us primarily from our members who are local agricultural producers and from purchases of corn on the open market. We anticipate purchasing corn from third parties should our members fail to supply us with enough corn to operate the ethanol plant at capacity. We do not anticipate experiencing difficulty purchasing the corn we require to operate the ethanol plant. 
We have an agreement with John Stewart & Associates ("JSA") to provide us with consulting services related to our risk management strategy. We pay JSA a fee of $2,500 per month to assist us in making risk management decisions regarding our commodity purchases. The agreement renews on a month-to-month basis. 
Natural Gas
Natural gas is an important input to our manufacturing process.  We purchase our natural gas on the open market and the price for our natural gas is based on market rates. We have a contract with Northern Natural Gas for the interstate transportation of our natural gas. We contract with NorthWestern Energy for the local transportation of our natural gas. Both contracts expire in 2028. We have had no interruptions or shortages in the supply of natural gas to the plant since operations commenced in 2001. We anticipate that we will be able to purchase sufficient natural gas to continue to operate the ethanol plant during our 2021 fiscal year.
Electricity
Electricity is necessary for lighting and powering much of the machinery and equipment used in the production process. We contract with Sioux Valley Energy, Inc. to provide all of the electric power and energy requirements for the ethanol plant. We have had no interruptions or shortages in the supply of electricity to the plant since operations commenced in 2001.
Water
Water is a necessary part of the ethanol production process. It is used in the fermentation process and to produce steam for the cooking, evaporation, and distillation processes. We contract with Big Sioux Community Water System, Inc. to meet our water requirements. Our current agreement with Big Sioux was modified in February 2020 and expires in 2025. Since our operations commenced in September 2001, we have had no interruption in the supply of water and all of our requirements have been met. 
Seasonal Factors in Business
    We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving and, as a result, increased gasoline demand. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. We also experience decreased distillers grains demand during the summer months due to natural depletion in the size of herds at cattle feed lots. Further, we expect some seasonality of demand for our corn oil since the biodiesel industry is a major corn oil user and biodiesel plants typically reduce production during the winter months. We experience some seasonality in the price we pay for natural gas with premium pricing during the winter months. This increase in natural gas prices coincides with increased natural gas demand for heating needs in the winter months.
Working Capital
    We primarily use our working capital for purchases of raw materials necessary to operate the ethanol plant, payments on our credit facilities, distributions to our members and capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade the ethanol plant. Our primary sources of working capital are income from our operations and investments as well as our revolving lines of credit with our primary lender, Farm Credit. For our 2021 fiscal year, we anticipate using cash from our operations and our credit facilities to maintain our current plant infrastructure. Management believes that our current sources of working capital are sufficient to sustain our operations for our 2021 fiscal year and beyond.
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
    As discussed above, we have marketing agreements with RPMG to market our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil. Therefore, we rely on RPMG to market almost all of our products, except for the modified/wet distillers grains that we market locally. Our financial success will be highly dependent on RPMG's ability to market our products at competitive prices. Any loss of RPMG as our marketing agent or any lack of performance under these agreements or inability to secure competitive prices could have a significant negative impact on our revenues. While we believe we can secure new marketers if RPMG were to fail, we may not be able to secure such new marketers at rates which are competitive with RPMG's. 
Our Competition
    Ethanol Competition
    We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers in the sale of our products and with respect to raw material purchases related to those products. Many of the ethanol producers with which we compete have greater resources than we do. While management believes we are a lower cost producer of ethanol, larger ethanol producers may be able to take advantage of economies of scale due to their larger size and increased bargaining power with both ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil customers and raw material suppliers. As of December 31, 2020, the Renewable Fuels Association estimates that there are 210 ethanol production facilities in the United States with capacity to produce approximately 17.6 billion gallons of ethanol per year. The largest ethanol producers include Archer Daniels Midland, Flint Hills Resources, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining, and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which is capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce.
The following table identifies the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities. 
U.S. FUEL ETHANOL PRODUCTION CAPACITY 
BY TOP PRODUCERS
Producers of Approximately 800
million gallons per year (MMgy) or more

Company | Current Capacity(MMgy) | Percent of Total

POET Biorefining | 1,805 | 10.3% 
Green Plains Renewable Energy | 1,128 | 6.4% 
Valero Renewable Fuels | 1,730 | 9.8% 
Flint Hills Resources | 840 | 4.8% 

        Updated:  December 31, 2020
The products that we produce are commodities. Since our products are commodities, there are typically no significant differences between the products we produce and the products of our competitors that would allow us to distinguish our products in the market. As a result, competition in the ethanol industry is primarily based on price and consistent fuel quality. 
    We have experienced increased competition from oil companies that have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year. Therefore, the oil companies may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate our ethanol plant. Further, some ethanol producers own multiple ethanol plants which may allow them to compete more effectively by providing them flexibility to run certain production facilities while they have other facilities shut down. Finally some ethanol producers who own ethanol plants in geographically diverse areas of the United States may spread the risk they encounter related to feedstock prices due to localized corn shortages or poor growing conditions.
    A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas, and continues to represent a source of competition for the ethanol industry. While there are currently a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, making electric cars not feasible for all consumers, there has been increased development of these recharging stations which is making this technology more widely available. Additional competition from these other sources of alternative energy, particularly in the automobile market, could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
In addition to domestic producers of ethanol, we face competition from ethanol produced in foreign countries, particularly Brazil. Ethanol imports have been lower in recent years and ethanol exports have been higher. As of May 1, 2013, Brazil increased its domestic ethanol use requirement from 20% to 25% which decreased the amount of ethanol available in Brazil for export. Further, in August 2017, Brazil instituted a quota and tariff on ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil which reduced exports to Brazil. Brazil increased the quota during our 2019 fiscal year which resulted in additional demand from Brazil, however, without this quota and tariff, Brazilian exports likely would have been higher. In December 2020, the Brazilian quota expired so all ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil is now subject 
to Brazil's import tariff. In the future, we may experience increased ethanol imports from Brazil which could put negative pressure on domestic ethanol prices and result in excess ethanol supply in the United States.
Competition among ethanol producers may continue to increase as gasoline demand decreases due to more fuel efficient vehicles being produced. If the concentration of ethanol used in most gasoline does not increase and gasoline demand is lower due to increased fuel efficiency by the vehicles operated in the United States, competition may increase among ethanol producers to supply the ethanol market.
Distillers Grains Competition
Our ethanol plant competes with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. Distillers grains are primarily used as an animal feed supplement which replaces corn and soybean meal. As a result, we believe that distillers grains prices are positively impacted by increases in corn and soybean prices. In addition, in recent years the United States ethanol industry has increased exports of distillers grains which management believes has positively impacted demand and prices for distillers grains in the United States. In the event these distillers grains exports decrease, including as a result of the Chinese tariffs which have significantly reduced export demand for distillers grains, it could lead to an oversupply of distillers grains in the United States. An oversupply of distillers grains could result in increased competition among ethanol producers for sales of distillers grains which could negatively impact market distillers grains prices in the United States. 
Corn Oil Competition
    We compete with many ethanol producers for the sale of corn oil. Many ethanol producers have installed the equipment necessary to separate corn oil from the distillers grains they produce which has increased competition for corn oil sales.
Governmental Regulation
Federal Ethanol Supports
    The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol, the most significant of which is the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the "RFS"). The RFS requires that in each year, a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022. Starting in 2009, the RFS required that a portion of the RFS must be met by certain "advanced" renewable fuels. These advanced renewable fuels include ethanol that is not made from corn, such as cellulosic ethanol and biomass based biodiesel. The use of these advanced renewable fuels increases each year as a percentage of the total renewable fuels required to be used in the United States.
    The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") has the authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirement, in whole or in part, provided one of the following two conditions have been met: (1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply; or (2) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. Recently, the EPA has been granting small refinery exemptions from the RFS while not using its authority to waive the RFS statutory volume requirements. These small refinery exemptions created unallocated gallons reducing the corn-based conventional biofuel RFS requirements by 2.25 billion gallons in 2018 and 2 billion gallons in 2019. These small refinery exemptions have had a significant negative impact on domestic demand for ethanol and have resulted in negative operating margins in the ethanol industry.
    On November 30, 2018, the final RVO for 2019 was set at 19.29 billion gallons and the corn-based ethanol RVO was set at 15 billion gallons. However, the EPA did not address small refinery exemptions in its 2019 RVO release. In addition, the EPA did not address the reallocation of 500 million gallons from the 2016 RVO which was ordered by a federal court in a recent lawsuit. In June 2019, the EPA proposed an RVO of 20.04 billion gallons and the corn-based ethanol RVO was set at 15 billion gallons. On December 19, 2019, the final RVO for 2020 was set at 20.09 billion gallons and the corn-based ethanol RVO was set at 15 billion gallons. The EPA has not yet established the RVO for 2021. The ethanol industry has been pushing the EPA to reverse the effects of these small refinery waivers which we believe are the reason for the poor operating margins during 2018 and 2019. In January 2020, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that small refinery exemptions may only be granted to refineries that had secured them continuously each year since 2010. Consistent with this ruling, in September 2020, the EPA denied certain small refinery exemption petitions filed by oil refineries in 2020 seeking retroactive relief from their ethanol use requirements for prior years.
    Most ethanol that is used in the United States is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. Estimates indicate that gasoline demand in the United States is approximately 143 billion gallons per year. Assuming that all gasoline in the United States is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol is 14.3 billion gallons per year. This is commonly referred to as the "blend wall," which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the use of higher percentage blends such as E15 or E85. These higher percentage blends may lead to additional ethanol demand if they become more widely available and accepted by the market.
    Many in the ethanol industry believe that it will be impossible to meet the RFS requirement in future years without an increase in the percentage of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline for use in standard (non-flex fuel) vehicles. The EPA has approved the use of E15, gasoline which is blended at a rate of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, in vehicles manufactured in the model year 2001 and later. However, there are still state hurdles that need to be addressed in some states before E15 will become more widely available. Many states still have regulatory issues that prevent the sale of E15. Sales of E15 may be limited because it is not approved for use in all vehicles, the EPA requires a label that management believes may discourage consumers from using E15, and retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. In addition, different gasoline blendstocks may be required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions which may limit E15 sales in these markets. As a result, the approval of E15 by the EPA has not had an immediate impact on ethanol demand in the United States. In June 2019, the Trump Administration approved the use of E15 year-round which has somewhat expanded the use of E15.
In May 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") announced the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program which consists of up to $100 million in funding for grants to be used to increase the availability of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel fuels. Funds may be awarded to retailers such as fueling stations and convenience stores to assist in the cost of installation or upgrading of fuel pumps and other infrastructure. In October 2020, the USDA announced the first round of awards to recipients of $22 million worth of grants. Recently the USDA closed on an additional $30 million worth of grants in a second round of funding.
Effect of Governmental Regulation
    The government's regulation of the environment changes constantly. We are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations and we have been required to obtain a number of environmental permits to construct and operate the ethanol plant. It is possible that more stringent federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted, which could increase our operating costs and expenses. It also is possible that federal or state environmental rules or regulations could be adopted that could have an adverse effect on the use of ethanol. Plant operations are governed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"). OSHA regulations may change such that the costs of operating the ethanol plant may increase. Any of these regulatory factors may result in higher costs or other adverse conditions effecting our operations, cash flows and financial performance.
    We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the ethanol plant. During our 2020 fiscal year, our costs of environmental compliance were approximately $219,000. We anticipate that our environmental compliance costs will be approximately $230,000 during our 2021 fiscal year. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations.
    In late 2009, California passed a Low Carbon Fuels Standard ("LCFS"). The California LCFS requires that renewable fuels used in California must accomplish certain reductions in greenhouse gases which is measured using a lifecycle analysis, similar to the RFS. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.
    In August 2017, Brazil instituted an import quota for ethanol produced in the United States and exported to Brazil, along with a 20% tariff on ethanol imports in excess of the quota. The quota expired in December 2020 so all U.S. ethanol exports to Brazil are now subject to the tariff. This tariff and quota have reduced exports of ethanol to Brazil and may continue to negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States. Any reduction in ethanol exports could negatively impact market ethanol prices in the United States. In addition, the Chinese government increased the tariff on United States ethanol imports into China from 30% to 45% and ultimately to 70%. Due to other recent tariff activity between the United States and China, management does not expect these Chinese tariffs to be removed in the near term. Both China and Brazil have been major 
sources of import demand for United States ethanol and distillers grains. These trade actions may result in negative operating margins for United States ethanol producers.
We are subject to environmental oversight by the EPA. There is always a risk that the EPA may enforce certain rules and regulations differently than South Dakota's environmental administrators. South Dakota or EPA rules are subject to change, and any such changes could result in greater regulatory burdens on plant operations. We could also be subject to environmental or nuisance claims from adjacent property owners or residents in the area arising from possible foul smells or other air or water discharges from the ethanol plant. Such claims may result in an adverse result in court if we are deemed to engage in a nuisance that substantially impairs the fair use and enjoyment of property.
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had 43 full-time employees. We do not expect the number of employees to materially change in the next 12 months.
