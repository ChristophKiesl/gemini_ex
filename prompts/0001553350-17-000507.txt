FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

GENERAL

Vetro, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 15, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of February 28. We do not have revenues, have no assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are a development-stage company, which we formed to commence operations in the business of selling crepes; however, we abandoned that business when control of the Company was sold by Tatiana Fumioka, on May 6, 2014. As a result, we are now controlled by Rama Mohan R. Busa, the principal shareholder and sole officer and director.

On April 30, 2014, Tatiana Fumioka (the Seller), entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to Mr. Rama Mohan R Busa, CEO of ANVI Global, Inc.(misspelled as by AVNI Global Inc in the Companys Form 8-K filing on May 22, 2014), a North Carolina corporation (the Purchaser), with a principal place of business in Cary, NC, the 8,000,000  shares of common stock of the Company owned by Ms. Fumioka, constituting approximately 75.8% of the Companys outstanding common stock to be transferred to the name of Mr. Rama Mohan R Busa, for $375,000, provided from his personal and family funds. The sale was consummated on May 6, 2014.  As a result of the sale, there was a change of control of the Registrant. This was a private transaction between the Seller and Purchaser, and no new shares of the Company were sold or issued.

The change of control was reported in the Form 8-K which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 22, 2014. Since the change of control, we have not started any business, and have no assets; therefore, we are deemed a shell, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

During the past fiscal year, we have been exploring the possibility of acquiring assets in the Brazilian mining industry; however, as of the date of this Annual Report we have not entered into any agreements or understandings with any person or entity, and therefore we are a still a shell company.
