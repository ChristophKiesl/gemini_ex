Overview
 Alico is an agribusiness with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus and conservation. The Company owns approximately 83,000 acres of land in eight Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands and Polk), and approximately 90,000 acres of mineral rights throughout Florida. Alico holds these mineral rights on substantially all its owned acres, with additional mineral rights on other acres. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves and conservation.
 Alico is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America.
 Alico, Inc. operates two divisions: Alico Citrus, a citrus producer on its own land and as a manager of citrus groves for third parties, and Land Management and Other Operations, which includes land conservation, encompassing environmental services, land leasing and related support operations.
 The Company manages its land based upon its primary usage and reviews its performance based upon two primary classifications - Alico Citrus and Land Management and Other Operations. The Alico Citrus division includes the production, cultivation and sale of citrus on its owned lands and as a manager of citrus groves for third parties. Land Management and Other Operations include leases for grazing rights, hunting leases, a farm lease, a lease to a third party of an aggregate mine, leases of oil extraction rights to third parties, and other miscellaneous operations generating income. Alico presents its financial results and the related discussion based upon its two business segments: (i) Alico Citrus and (ii) Land Management and Other Operations.
 Recent Developments
 The COVID-19 Pandemic
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current novel coronavirus outbreak (“COVID-19”) to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country have imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including certain agriculture businesses.
 On November 4, 2021, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) posted an Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) on mandating that all private employers with 100 or more employees ensure their employees are COVID-19 fully vaccinated before entering the employer’s worksite or, at the employer’s option, require employees who remain unvaccinated and want to come to the worksite to wear an approved face covering and produce a negative COVID-19 test at least weekly. Pursuant to the ETS, employers must offer up to four hours of additional paid time off, including travel time, per vaccine dose to allow employees to be vaccinated and reasonable time and paid sick leave to recover from side effects experienced after each vaccine dose. Pursuant to the ETS, the ETS remains in effect for a maximum of six months. This ETS implements President Biden’s COVID-19 Action Plan, which aims to accelerate the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States.

Pursuant to the ETS, the ETS is effective immediately upon its publication in the Federal Register. Pursuant to the ETS, employers must comply with most requirements within 30 days of publication (December 5th) and with optional testing requirements within 60 days of publication (January 4th). Employees who have completed their vaccination by that date do not have to be tested, even if they have not yet completed the 2-week waiting period. On November 6, 2021, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an emergency motion to stay enforcement of the ETS, subject to the resolution of ongoing litigation challenging the constitutionality of the ETS. The order enjoins the federal government from taking any action to enforce the ETS while it is in effect. On November 12, 2021, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its suspension of the ETS and, on November 16, 2021, OSHA announced it suspended its activities related to the implementation and enforcement of the ETS pending future developments in the litigation. It is unknown how long the Fifth Circuit’s stay will remain in place. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was selected through the lottery system on November 16, 2021, to hear a consolidated action concerning multiple challenges to the ETS and is authorized to uphold or lift the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals order. 
 Also, a number of state governments have considered legislation related to employer vaccine mandates during the pandemic. OSHA maintains that its ETS preempts these laws, but states such as the State of Florida disagree. On November 17, 2021, the Florida legislature passed legislation, which was signed into law on November 18, 2021 and codified at section 381.00317, Florida Statutes, prohibiting private-sector employers from implementing a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for full-time, part-time, or contract employees without providing at least five individual exemptions, including, but not limited to, pregnancy or anticipated pregnancy; religious reasons; COVID-19 immunity; periodic testing; and the use of employer-provided personal protective equipment. If an employer fails to comply with the new law and terminates an employee based on a COVID-19 vaccination mandate, then the employer will be subject to a fine of up to $50,000 per violation.
 The Company plans to monitor conflicting guidance from the State of Florida and the federal government and adjust its policies in accordance with the resolution of the ongoing litigation in the federal courts.
 Since the commencement of COVID-19 in March 2020, the Company took steps to allow and encourage greater separation for our employed and contracted field workers and has worked with its harvesters, haulers and suppliers to minimize interactions. For the continued protection of our employees and in accordance with the OSHA mandate, the Company intends to comply with all requirements as outlined in the ETS that was published on November 4, 2021, to the extent consistent with applicable law. 
 To date, the Company has experienced no material adverse impacts from this pandemic.
 Prepayment and Restructure of Fixed-Rate Term Loans
 In April 2021, the Company made a prepayment of $10,312,500 on the Met Fixed-Rate Term Loans and, effective May 1, 2021, the Company modified its Met Fixed-Rate Term Loans, which in the aggregate, after the prepayment, had a balance of $70,000,000 to be interest only with a balloon payment to be paid at maturity, which is November 1, 2029. As part of this modification, the interest rate on these Met Fixed-Rate Term Loans, which were bearing interest at 4.15%, has been adjusted to 3.85% and the Company no longer has the prepayment option previously allowed under the arrangement.
 Sales and Purchase of Land
 On December 3, 2021, the State of Florida purchased, under the Florida Forever program, approximately 1,638 acres of the Alico Ranch for approximately $5,675,000 pursuant to an option agreement entered into on September 21, 2021 between the State of Florida and the Company.
 On June 3, 2021, the Company sold approximately 11,700 acres, which were encumbered by an easement, to a third-party for approximately $12,219,000.  In 2013, these acres were enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program (“WRP”), which calls for the restoration and maintenance of the property for the duration of the WRP easement.  As part of that enrollment in 2013, Alico received approximately $1,800 per acre.  
 On April 15, 2021, the State of Florida purchased, under the Florida Forever program, approximately 5,734 acres of Alico Ranch for approximately $14,445,000, pursuant to an option agreement between the State of Florida and Alico dated December 15, 2020. This is the third sales transaction we have completed with the State of Florida within the last three years, aggregating over 22,000 acres.  Alico used most of the net sales proceeds to prepay a portion of its fixed-rate term debt.
 On October 30, 2020, the Company purchased approximately 3,280 gross acres located in Hendry County for a purchase price of $18,230,000. This acquisition allows the Company to add additional scale to its existing 46,000 gross acres of citrus properties. Strategically, with these acquired groves neighboring existing Alico groves, Alico has continued to realize economy of scale which has allowed Alico to continue to operate as a low-cost, high producing citrus grower.

Federal Relief Program
 The Company was eligible for Hurricane Irma federal relief programs for block grants that were being administered through the State of Florida. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company received approximately $4,629,000 and $15,597,000, respectively, under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant (“CRBG”) program. These federal relief proceeds represented Part 1 and Part 2 reimbursement under the program. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the Company received approximately $4,299,000, representing reimbursement under Part 3 of the program. The remaining portion of the funds that are due to Alico under the Florida CRBG program relates to certain crop insurance expenses incurred by the Company, which is estimated to be approximately $2,000,000.  In October 2021, the Company received its first portion of this crop insurance expense reimbursement in an amount equal to $1,000,000 and expects to receive the remaining portion in fiscal year 2023.
The Land We Manage
 We regularly review our land holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating income potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and efforts are being made to sell such land holdings or to exchange such land holdings for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile, or to lease such land holdings.
 Our land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:
 
 
 | Gross Acreage | | Operating Activities 
-------------------------------------+---------------+--------+------------------------
Alico Citrus | | | | 
Citrus Groves | | 48,830 | | Citrus Cultivation 
Citrus Nursery | 22 | | Citrus Tree Development
 | | 48,852 | | 
Land Management and Other Operations | | | | 
Ranch | | 32,979 | | Leasing and Conservation
Other Land | | 1,446 | | Mining Lease and Office 
 | | 34,425 | | 
Total | | 83,277 | | 

Alico Citrus
 We own and manage citrus land in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties in the State of Florida and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Alico citrus groves total approximately 48,852 gross acres or 58.7% of our land holdings. The Company manages approximately 7,400 acres of citrus land on behalf of third-party grove owners in addition to the 48,852 gross acres owned by Alico.
 Our citrus acreage is further detailed in the following table:
 
 
 | Net Plantable | | | | | | | | | | 
-----------------+---------------+--------+------------+---+-----+--------+---+---------------------+-----+-----------------+-------
 | Producing | | Developing | | | Fallow | | Total Net Plantable | | Support & Other | | | Gross | 
DeSoto County | | 16,185 | | | 115 | | | 522 | | | 16,822 | | | | 4,650 | | 21,472
Polk County | | 4,870 | | | — | | | — | | | 4,870 | | | | 2,237 | | 7,107 
Collier County | | 4,261 | | | — | | | — | | | 4,261 | | | | 2,905 | | 7,166 
Hendry County | | 5,735 | | | 57 | | | 175 | | | 5,967 | | | | 2,799 | | 8,766 
Charlotte County | | 1,729 | | | — | | | 138 | | | 1,867 | | | 676 | | 2,543 |

Total | | 34,246 | | | 172 | | | 835 | | | 35,253 | | | | 13,599 | | 48,852

 
Of the 48,852 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage 13,599 acres are classified as support and other acreage. Support and other acreage include acres used for roads, barns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees, but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a small citrus tree nursery of approximately 22 acres and utilize the trees produced in our own operations. The 35,253 remaining acres are classified as net plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly 
 6


producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (i.e., acres that are planted with trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow.
 
In an effort to replace trees lost in Hurricane Irma and increase the density of our citrus groves, Alico has planted approximately 1,500,000 new trees over the past four years. This level of planting has been substantially higher than the normal level of tree attrition. We will continue to evaluate the density throughout our groves and determine the appropriate tree plantings moving forward. Typically, citrus trees become fruit bearing approximately four years after planting and peak around seven to eight years after planting.
 
Our Alico Citrus business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market were approximately 82.7%, 91.0%, and 95.0% of Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The overall decrease in sales to processed markets as a percentage of citrus revenues was due to an agreement entered into on July 16, 2020 with an affiliated group of third parties to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services (“Grove Management Services”) for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company is reimbursed by the third parties for all its costs incurred related to providing these Grove Management Services and receives a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. The Company records both an increase in revenues and expenses as and when the Company provides these Grove Management Services. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, under this agreement, the Company recorded approximately $15,752,000 of operating revenue relating to these Grove Management Services, including the management fee. Excluding these revenues for these citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services, revenue to processed markets represents approximately 97.1% of total citrus revenues.
 The average pound solids per box was 5.66, 5.96, and 5.91, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 We generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a floor and ceiling price. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable relative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price to the extent it does not exceed the ceiling price.
 Our citrus produced for the processed citrus market in fiscal year 2021 under our largest agreement was subject to floor prices and ceiling prices. Under this agreement, if the market price was below the floor prices or exceeded the ceiling prices, then 50% of the shortfall or excess was deducted from the floor price or added to the ceiling price. Under our next largest agreement, our citrus produced is subject to a minimum floor price and maximum ceiling price and is based on a cost-plus structure. 
 On each of May 18, 2020 and May 20, 2020, the Company entered into two new agreements to supply Tropicana, its largest customer, with citrus fruit. These new agreements were effective October 1, 2020, expire on July 31, 2024, and succeeded our existing largest agreement with this customer which expired at the end of September 2020.
 Although we believe other markets and customers are available for our citrus products, we also believe that new arrangements in these other markets or with other customers may be less favorable than our current contracts.  
 Our sales to the fresh citrus market constituted approximately 0.6%, 2.6%, and 3.0% of our Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We produce numerous varieties for the fresh fruit market including grapefruit, navel and other fresh varieties. Generally, our fresh fruit is sold to packing houses by the box and the packing houses are responsible for the harvest and haul of these boxes. We produced approximately 61,000, 267,000, and 210,000 fresh fruit boxes for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 On July 16, 2020, the Company executed an agreement with an affiliated group of third parties to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services (“Grove Management Services”) for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is reimbursed by the third parties for all of its costs incurred related to providing these services and also is to receive a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. In August 2021, the third party purchased approximately 900 acres, which will be in addition to the acres currently receiving Grove Management Services. The Company, prior to this agreement, was already providing Grove Management Services to several small third-party grove owners on acres within the Company’s groves and continues to provide such services. Revenues generated from our Grove Management Services were approximately 16.1%, 5.1%, and 1.1% of our total citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
On October 30, 2020, the Company purchased approximately 3,280 gross acres located in Hendry County for a purchase price of $18,230,000. This acquisition allows the Company to add additional scale to its existing 46,000 gross acres of citrus properties. Strategically, with these acquired groves neighboring existing Alico groves, Alico believes that this acquisition will help Alico with its operation designed to be a low-cost, high producing citrus grower.

Revenues from our Alico Citrus operations were approximately 97.5%, 96.6%, and 97.4% of our total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Land Management and Other Operations
 We own and manage land in Collier, Glades, and Hendry Counties and are engaged in land leasing for recreational and grazing purposes, conservation, and mining activities. Our Land Management and Other Operations land holdings total 34,425 gross acres, or 41.3% of our total acreage.
 Our Land Management and Other Operations acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2021:
 
 
 | Acreage | 
---------------+---------+-------
Hendry County | | 29,877
Glades County | 526 | 
Collier County | | 4,022 
Total | | 34,425

 
On June 3, 2021, the Company sold approximately 11,700 acres, which were encumbered by an easement, to a third-party for approximately $12,219,000.  In 2013, these acres were enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve Program (“WRP”), which calls for the restoration and maintenance of the property for the duration of the WRP easement.  As part of that enrollment in 2013, Alico received approximately $1,800 per acre.  
 
On April 15, 2021, the State of Florida purchased, under the Florida Forever program, approximately 5,734 acres of Alico Ranch for approximately $14,445,000, pursuant to an option agreement between the State of Florida and Alico dated December 15, 2020. This is the third sales transaction we have completed with the State of Florida within the last three years, aggregating over 22,000 acres, including the September 2020 sale described below.  Alico used most of the net sales proceeds to prepay a portion of its fixed-rate term debt.
 
On September 10, 2020, the Company sold approximately 10,700 acres on the western part of Alico Ranch to the State of Florida. Because the acres involved in the sale would have been critical to our planned dispersed water storage project, the Company has decided to no longer pursue permit approval activities for this project from that point forward. As a result of this decision to no longer pursue permit approval activities for this project, the Company has renamed this segment Land Management and Other Operations to better reflect the components of this segment. The Company did not ever get to the point where it was generating any revenue from the dispersed water storage project and incurred expenses of $0, $1,346,000, and $1,206,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 
On March 27, 2020, the Company sold certain sections at the East Ranch for approximately $2,980,000 and realized a gain of approximately $2,748,000. The Company subsequently used substantially all of the net cash proceeds to purchase a like-kind asset in May 2020, which has allowed the Company to defer substantially all of the tax impact of the gain on sale of this ranch land.
 Revenues from Land Management and Other Operations were approximately 2.5%, 3.4%, and 2.6% of total operating revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Our Strategy
 Our core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing land through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and acquiring new land or operations with appreciation potential.
 Our objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell under-productive land and other assets not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the expectations of stockholder, customers, clients and partners.
 Our strategy is based on best management practices of our agricultural operations and the environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and natural resources. We try to manage our land in a sustainable manner and evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new opportunities. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to the Company’s core beliefs.

Intellectual Property
 While we consider our various intellectual property to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single piece of intellectual property or group of related intellectual property registrations or rights.
Seasonal Nature of Business
 As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations and revenues are predominantly seasonal in nature. The following table illustrates the seasonality of our agribusiness revenues:
 
 
 | Fiscal Year 
-------------------------------------------------+-------------
 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 
 | Ending 12/31 | Ending 3/31 | Ending 6/30 | Ending 9/30
 | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sept
Harvest Fresh and Early/Mid Varieties of Oranges | | X | X | X | X | | | | | | | 
Harvest Valencia Oranges | | | | | | X | X | X | X | | | 

Significant Customers
 Revenue from Tropicana represented approximately 77.5%, 86.9%, and 88.6% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The revenue in fiscal year 2021 from Tropicana was generated primarily from two separate contracts. This revenue was generated from the sale of our citrus product in the processed market. No other single customer provided more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2021, 2020 or 2019.
 The overall decrease in Tropicana revenue as a percentage of sales was expected, attributable to an increase in overall sales generated from an agreement entered into in July 2020 with an affiliated group of third parties to provide citrus grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services for approximately 7,000 acres owned by such third parties. Under the terms of this agreement, the Company is reimbursed by the third parties for all its costs incurred related to providing these services and receives a management fee based on acres covered under this agreement. The Company records both an increase in sales revenue and an increase in expenses as and when the Company provides these citrus grove caretaking management services. Revenue from Tropicana represents approximately 90.1% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.
 Competition
 The orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most notably Brazil and Mexico. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import restrictions and foreign currency exchange rates.
 Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 
Alico is an agricultural company which, based upon its rich heritage and traditions, seeks not only to maximize value for its customers and stockholders, but also to enhance its legacy by employing sustainable practices in all aspects of operations including stewardship of both its natural and human resources. The Company recognizes the increased emphasis by stockholders, business partners and other key constituents in recent years on ESG programs that are embedded into day-to-day business policies and practices. The Company is proud of its commitment to doing the right thing for communities, the environment, and its employees. 
 Governmental Regulations
 Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in material compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 9


Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every reasonable effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require in our leases that lessees of our property comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing.
 We are subject to other laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies within the United States, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.
 Human Capital Management
 
Purpose and Company Values
 
Supporting our people is a fundamental value for Alico. We believe the Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees and the employees of our independent contractors significantly benefit our operations and performance. The Company's management oversees various employee initiatives and also monitors the effectiveness of the personnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract for certain harvesting and hauling services.
Employees
 
We believe in a culture of equity, diversity and inclusion. We are also committed to advancing safe and respectful work environments where our employees are invited to bring their talents, backgrounds and expertise to bear on the success of our business and where every person has the opportunity to thrive personally and professionally.
Hiring, Development and Retention
 
Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and takes into account the services that are performed for us by our independent contractors. We rely on our independent contractors to manage their respective employee levels so that the harvesting and hauling services they are obligated to perform for us are consistent with the contractual obligations of these independent contractors and enable us to satisfy our harvesting and hauling needs. Management believes that through its own employees, coupled with the human capital supplied by its independent contractors, it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable, that its relations with its independent contractors is favorable, and that the relations that the independent contractors and the Company have with the employees of the independent contractors is favorable.
 
Employee Safety and Well-Being
 
Health and safety in the workplace for our employees and personnel provided by independent contractors with which we contract is one of the Company’s core values. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. In order to support and enhance health and safety practices, the Company routinely conducts safety training with employees to emphasize safety when conducting grove caretaking, general employee health, proper equipment operating techniques, office ergonomics and other important safety topics. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees and the personnel provided by independent contractors safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so that its workforce can more safely and effectively perform their work.
 
Inclusion and Diversity
 People are critical to our efforts to drive growth and deliver value for stockholders. One of the ways we have put people at the center is by continuing to work toward a more inclusive and diverse workplace where each person feels respected, valued and seen and can be the best version of themselves – from women and ethnic employees to veterans, among others. With employees, management and directors representing the diversity around the world, the Company can access stronger insights into different cultures and backgrounds, which ultimately helps the Company to better operate the business. 
 
As of September 30, 2021, ethnically diverse employees represent 69% of the Company’s Citrus operations, 27% of Corporate, General, Administrative and Other. Women made up 50% of the Company’s Corporate, General, Administrative and Other and 16% of the Company’s Citrus operations. On August 6, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company increased the size of the Board to nine and appointed Ms. Katherine English as a director to serve on (i) the Compensation Committee and (ii) the Nominating and Governance Committee. Ms. English’s appointment is part of the Company’s commitment to promote diversity and inclusion. 
 10



Based on our Inclusion and Diversity strategy, the Company promotes a greater sense of inclusion through a variety of initiatives, which includes a Company-wide women’s group to promote mentoring, career advancement, training, comradery, and empowerment. 
 
Compensation and Benefits
 Our compensation and benefits are designed to support the financial, mental, and physical well-being of our employees. We are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics. We believe our base wages and salaries, which we review annually, are fair and competitive with the external labor markets in which our employees work. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay.

None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 
Workforce Housing
 
We own and maintain 37 residential housing units located in various counties in Florida that we lease to employees and former employees. Our residential units provide affordable housing to many of our employees, including our agribusiness employees. Employees live close to their work, which reduces traffic and commuting times. This unique employment benefit helps us maintain a dependable, long-term employee base.
Capital Resources and Raw Materials
 Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, and over the long term, through internally generated funds, cash flows from operations, the sale of under-productive land and other assets, our existing lines of credit and access to capital markets. The Company has commitments that provide for lines of revolving credit that are available for our general and corporate use.
 Raw materials needed to cultivate the various crops grown by the Company consist primarily of fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides and fuel and are readily available from local suppliers.
 Societal Well-Being
 The Company remains committed to a healthy and equitable society to ensure our collective well-being for future generations. In the past year, we provided cash grants and supporting donations to support our communities and promote health and safety, education, and justice.
