ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our History
On December 17, 2018, Better Choice Company made a $2.2 million investment in TruPet, an online seller of pet foods, pet nutritional products and related pet supplies. On February 2, 2019, Better Choice Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remainder of TruPet. In connection with the acquisition, 15,027,533 shares of Better Choice Company common stock were issued to TruPet’s members for the remaining 93% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of TruPet. We closed the acquisition on May 6, 2019.
On February 28, 2019, Better Choice Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bona Vida, an emerging hemp-based CBD platform focused on developing a portfolio of brand and product verticals within the animal health and wellness space. In connection with the acquisition, 18,103,273 shares of Better Choice Company common stock were issued to Bona Vida’s stockholders for all shares of Bona Vida’s common stock outstanding immediately prior to the acquisition. We closed the acquisition on May 6, 2019.
On October 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (as amended, the “Halo Agreement”) with Halo, Thriving Paws, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Thriving Paws”), HH-Halo LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“HH-Halo” and, together with Thriving Paws, the “Sellers”) and HH-Halo, in the capacity of the representative of the Sellers. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Halo Agreement, among other things, we agreed to purchase from the Sellers one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Halo. The aggregate consideration payable by us under the Halo Agreement was $38.2 million, subject to customary adjustments for Halo’s net working capital, cash, and indebtedness, and consisted of a combination of (i) cash, (ii) shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and (iii) convertible subordinated notes and accompanying stock purchase warrants. We closed this acquisition, which we refer to as the Halo Acquisition, on December 19, 2019.
Overview of Our Business
Better Choice is a growing animal health and wellness company ready to lead the global industry shift toward pet products and services that help dogs and cats live healthier, happier and longer lives. Our mission is to become the most innovative premium pet food company in the world, and we are motivated by our commitment to making products with integrity and treating pets and their parents with respect. We position our portfolio of brands to benefit from the trends of growing pet humanization and an increased consumer focus on health and wellness, and have adopted a laser focused approach to growth that is driven by new product innovation. Our executive team has a proven history of success in both pet and consumer-packaged goods, and has over 50 years of combined experience in the pet industry and over 100 years of combined experience in the consumer-packaged goods industry. 
Better Choice’s best-in-class product offering is sold today under the Halo and TruDog brands and has enabled the Company to penetrate multiple channels of trade, which we believe enables us to deliver on core consumer needs and respond to changing channel dynamics that have only accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We group these channels of trade into four distinct categories: E-Commerce, which includes the sale of product to online retailers such as Amazon and Chewy; Brick & Mortar, which includes the sale of product to pet specialty chains such as Petco, PetSmart, select grocery chains and neighborhood pet stores; Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) which includes the sale of product through our online web platform; and International, which includes the sale of product to foreign distribution partners and to select international retailers. We believe our omni-channel approach is a significant competitive advantage, as it allows us to design and sell products purpose-built for success in specific channels while maintaining our ability to leverage marketing and sales resources cross-channel. 
New product innovation represents the cornerstone of our growth plan, and our established supply and distribution infrastructure allows us to develop, manufacture and bring new products to market in generally under nine months. Our flexible and scalable outsourced manufacturing model also promotes innovation, as we offer a wide variety of dog and cat food products under the Halo and TruDog brands that serve many different consumer needs. Founded in 1986, the Halo brand consists of a diversified, premium natural dog and cat portfolio, with products derived from real whole meat, no rendered meat meal and non-genetically modified (non-"GMO") fruits and vegetables, unlike many other kibble and canned products currently in the marketplace. In addition to its dry kibble and canned wet food offering, Halo also has a successful line of freeze-dried treats for dogs and cats and a growing line of award-winning vegan products for dogs. Founded in 2013, the TruDog brand offers ultra-premium, freeze-dried raw dog food, toppers, treats and supplements sold predominantly on its DTC website. Freeze-dried raw dog food is one of the fastest growing sub-category of premium pet food, with Packaged Facts reporting 39% YoY growth in the sub-category in 2019. We strongly believe that both brands are well positioned to take advantage of pet parents’ increasing desire to feed only the highest quality ingredients to their pets, and that there will continue to be innovative opportunities for brand consolidation over time.
Product Lines
We have a strong portfolio of premium animal health and wellness products for dogs and cats sold under the Halo, TruDog, and Rawgo! brand names across multiple forms and classes, including foods, treats, toppers, dental products, chews, grooming products and supplements. Our products consist of naturally formulated premium kibble and canned dog and cat food, freeze-dried raw dog food and treats, vegan dog food and treats, oral care products, supplements and grooming aids. Our core products sold under the Halo brand are sustainably sourced, derived from real whole meat and no rendered meat meal and include non-GMO fruits and vegetables. Our core products sold under the TruDog brand are made according to our nutritional philosophy of fresh, meat-based nutrition and minimal processing. 
We offer our customers over 100 active stock keeping units (“SKUs”), and all of our products are sold under the Halo, TruDog, or Rawgo! brand name, with ingredients, packaging and labeling customized by SKU.
Although Bona Vida remains a wholly owned subsidiary of the Better Choice Company, as of December 31, 2020 Better Choice does not currently sell or market any CBD products, does not currently own any CBD related inventory or raw materials and does not currently have plans to re-enter the CBD market at this time.
Supply, Manufacturing and Logistics
Our products sold under the Halo brand are made strictly from naturally raised animals on sustainable farms and are manufactured in the United States. By sourcing cage-free poultry, pasture-raised beef, and wild-caught fish from certified sustainable fisheries and not including meat meals or other animal byproducts in its formulations, Halo is able to provide pets and pet parents with a nutritious and highly digestible suite of food and treats. Halo partners with a number of co-manufacturing partners to produce its products. Halo’s dog and cat foods meet The Association of American Feed Control Officials (“AAFCO”) guidelines and are small-batch tested for common contaminants prior to leaving the manufacturer.
Our products sold under the TruDog brand are manufactured and sourced from a variety of third-party and suppliers in both the United States and New Zealand and use healthy, natural ingredients, with all purchases transacted in U.S. dollars. Many products are preserved using either freeze drying or gentle air dehydration to eliminate the need for artificial preservatives and added chemicals. Our treats and chews are oven-baked, using natural ingredients for maximum nutrition and protein content. Like Halo, TruDog raw dog foods meet AAFCO guidelines and are small-batch tested for common contaminants prior to leaving the manufacturer. 
We utilize logistics service providers as a part of our supply chain, primarily for shipping and logistics support. Fulfillment of orders for both the Halo and Trudog brands is managed by a third-party warehousing and logistics partner based in Lebanon, Tennessee. Our DTC ecosystem allows us to efficiently manage and customize the online shopping experience for customers, including a customer dashboard where shoppers can manage and track orders and order history. Our products are shipped by trusted carriers for expeditious and reliable delivery.
Customers
The following chart provides a breakdown of net sales by channel for the year ended December 31, 2020:
E-Commerce partners include Amazon, Chewy, Petflow, Thrive Market and Vitacost. While the industry-wide E-Commerce sales have retreated somewhat following the March 2020 pantry stocking, the sale of pet food and supplies online has increased 35% year-over-year according to Packaged Facts, with subscription sales nearly equal to the March 2020 peak. We anticipate our ability to reach a growing base of diverse customers online will only increase as E-Commerce penetration increases as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our DTC website also has a loyalty program called the TruDog Love Club (“TLC”), which incentivizes repeat purchases and customer loyalty.
Brick & Mortar partners include Petco, Petsmart, neighborhood pet stores and select grocery accounts. Although E-Commerce led industry growth in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we strongly believe Better Choice’s long-established relationships with key Brick & Mortar customers will enable us to jointly launch new products in the future that are designed for in-store success. 
International distribution partners are driven by purchases in China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. We believe that our growth in Asia is fueled by increasing levels of economic financial status and demand for premium, western manufactured products, with China representing the largest market opportunity for growth and 48% of Better Choice’s international sales in 2020. According to Euromonitor, the Chinese market for premium dry dog and cat food is anticipated to grow at a 20% CAGR and 28% CAGR, respectively, from 2015 through 2025. 
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing strategies are designed to clearly communicate to consumers about the benefits of our products and to build awareness of our brands. We deploy a broad set of marketing tools across various forms of media to reach consumers through multiple touch points and engage with a number of marketing agencies to develop content and product packaging. Our marketing initiatives include the use of social and digital marketing, Search Engine Optimization, email and SMS marketing, and paid media (Facebook, Instagram & YouTube), among other proven strategies to generate and convert sales prospects into loyal, satisfied customers. In addition to directly targeting and educating consumers of our products, we partner with a number of retailers such as Amazon, Chewy and Petco to develop joint sales and marketing initiatives to increase sales and acquire new customers.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related stay at home orders, consumer purchasing behaviors have shifted dramatically in the U.S. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, E-Commerce penetration increased from 13% in 2019 to 34% at the end of Q1 2020. Although approximately 59% of Better Choice’s sales are made online today, we remain committed to partnering with select Brick & Mortar retailers in pet specialty and neighborhood pet, as in-store recommendation and trial represent a significant opportunity for new customer acquisition. We believe that these in-store partnerships are complementary to the incentives that our E-Commerce partners offer to drive monthly subscriptions, and build upon the recurring revenue that we generate online. 
Competition
The pet health and wellness industry is highly competitive. Competitive factors include product quality, ingredients, brand awareness and loyalty, product variety, product packaging and design, reputation, price, advertising, promotion, and nutritional claims. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
We compete with manufacturers of conventional pet food such as Mars, Nestlé and Big Heart Pet Brands (part of the J.M. Smucker Company), and manufacturers of specialty and natural pet food such as Blue Buffalo (part of General Mills), Wellness, Fromm, Orijen, Merrick (part of Nestlé), Stella and Chewy, I and Love and You, and Freshpet. In addition, we compete with many regional niche brands in individual geographic markets.
Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
We rely upon the supply of raw materials that meet our specifications, such as USA farm-raised beef, Global Animal Partnership Certified Step 2 ("GAP 2") cage-free whole chicken and associated broths, GAP 2 certified cage-free whole turkey and associated broths, Marine Stewardship Council ("MSC") certified wild-caught salmon and MSC certified wild-caught whitefish and associated broths, and select non-GMO fruits and vegetables, such as peas, sweet potatoes and lentils. If any raw material is adulterated and does not meet our specifications, it could significantly impact our ability to source manufactured products and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We rely on Alphia, Inc. (“Alphia” f/k/a “C.J. Foods”) for the supply and co-manufacturing of dry kibble sold under the Halo brand, Simmons Pet Food, Inc. (“Simmons”) for the supply and co-manufacturing of the majority of canned wet food sold under the Halo brand, and Carnivore Meat Company, LLC (“Carnivore”) for the supply and co-manufacturing of freeze-dried food and treats sold under the TruDog brand. Together, CJ Foods, Simmons, and Carnivore represent more than 75% of product volume sold across the Better Choice platform. In addition, we sourced approximately 76% of inventory purchases from three vendors for the year ended December 31, 2020 and approximately 74% from one vendor for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 45 employees, all of which are full-time. Our employees are not represented by any labor union or any collective bargaining arrangement with respect to their employment with us. We have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. 
Many of our employees, including members of our management team, have been reporting to work remotely due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has resulted in the closure of our offices in Florida, Ohio and New York. Our operations or productivity may continue to be impacted throughout the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and government-mandated closures.
Government Regulation
The regulation of animal food products in the United States is complex, multi-faceted, and currently undergoing significant change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and other regulatory authorities at the federal, state and local levels, as well as authorities in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, composition, manufacture, import, export, labeling, storage, distribution, promotion, marketing, and post-market reporting of animal foods. We, along with our third-party contractors, are required to navigate a complex regulatory framework in the countries in which we wish to manufacture, test, import, export, or sell our products.
We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our distributors and suppliers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
FDA Regulation of Animal Foods
The FDA regulates foods, including foods intended for animals, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The FDCA defines “food” as articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, which includes products that are intended primarily for nutritional use, taste, or aroma and the components of such products. For animal foods in particular, this definition applies based on their intended use regardless of labelling as animal food, treats, or supplements. The FDA also imposes certain requirements on animal foods relating to their composition, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing. Among other things, the facilities in which our products and ingredients are manufactured must register with the FDA, comply with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) and comply with a range of food safety requirements.
Although pet foods are not required to obtain premarket approval from the FDA, any substance that is added to or is expected to become a component of a pet food must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation, unless it is generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”) under the conditions of its intended use or if it appears on an FDA-recognized list of acceptable animal food ingredients in the Official Publication of the Association of American Feed Control Officials ("AAFCO"). A food may be adulterated if it uses an ingredient that is neither GRAS nor an approved food additive, and that food may not be legally marketed in the United States.
The labeling of pet foods is regulated by both the FDA and state regulatory authorities. FDA regulations require proper identification of the product, a net quantity statement, a statement of the name and place of business of the manufacturer or distributor and proper listing of all the ingredients in order of predominance by weight. The FDA also considers certain specific claims on pet food labels to be medical claims and therefore subject to prior review and approval by the FDA. For example, pet food products that are labeled or marketed with claims that may suggest that they are intended to treat or prevent a specific disease in pets would potentially meet the statutory definitions of both a food and a drug. 
The FDA recently issued guidance containing a list of specific factors it will consider in determining whether to initiate enforcement action against such products if they do not comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to drugs, including, among other things, whether the product is only made available through or under the direction of a veterinarian and does not present a known safety risk when used as labeled. The FDA may classify some of our products differently than we do and may impose more stringent regulations which could lead to possible enforcement action.
Under the FDCA, the FDA may require the recall of an animal food product if there is a reasonable probability that the product is adulterated or misbranded, and the use of or exposure to the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, pet food manufacturers may voluntarily recall or withdraw their products from the market. If the FDA believes that our products are adulterated, misbranded or otherwise marketed in violation of the FDCA, the agency make take further enforcement action, including:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product;
•required modification of promotional materials or issuance of corrective marketing information;
•issuance of safety alerts, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about a product;
•warning or untitled letters;
•product seizure or detention;
•refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•fines, injunctions, or consent decrees; and
•imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Our Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce our brand, our sub-brands and our consumers’ perception of our products. The current registrations of these trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with the goods or services identified in the applicable registrations. In addition to trademark protection, we have registered more than 100 domain names, including www.trupet.com, www.trudog.com, www.rawgo.com, www.halopets.com, www.orapup.com and www.bonavida.com, that are important to the successful implementation of our marketing and advertising strategy. We rely on and carefully protect unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position.
In April 2019, we entered into an intellectual property license with Elvis Presley Enterprises, LLC, pursuant to which we licensed the image, likeness, and persona of Elvis Presley and an associated trademark (“Houndog”) for use in the United States and Canada (subject to a territorial restriction in the geographical area surrounding Memphis, Tennessee) in connection with the advertisement, promotion and sale, via approved distribution channels, of certain of our CBD-infused animal health and wellness products. In January 2020, we terminated the agreement with no further obligations under the agreement.
