FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

As used in this annual report, and unless otherwise indicated, the terms "we", "us", "our", the Registrant, "the Company", means GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT CLUBS, INC., initially known as Betafox Corp., and then Future World Group, Inc. from November, 2015 until February, 2017, when we amended our Charter to our current corporate name.

All dollar amounts refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated.

GENERAL

We were incorporated in Nevada on September 10, 2013, as Betafox Corp. Our limited business until May 11, 2015, when control of our Company changed, was attempting to make candles. Because previous management was unable to raise sufficient capital to enable our Company to develop its intended operations, on that date, Mr. Giorgos Kallides, our previous majority shareholder and sole officer and director, sold his 6,000,000 shares to Future Continental Limited, and resigned all of his positions with our Company. Mr. Pei Lei became our new CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and, as part of the change of control, (a) Mr. Kallides cancelled his loan of $11,672 which was owed to him by our Company, and (b) our previously limited operation was sold to Mr. Kallides for $1 (see Item 11 herein). In October, 2015, Future Continental Limited transferred the 6,000,000 shares to Mr. Lei Pei, in consideration of Mr. Pei serving as, and continuing to serve as, our director and CEO. In November, 2015, we changed our corporate name to Future World Group, Inc.; and on February 26, 2017, we changed our corporate name to Global Entertainment Clubs, Inc.

As reported in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 8, 2016, Mr. Peis 100%-owned company Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd. (Sky Rover) loaned us $1,000,000 (the Loan), pursuant to a three-year, unsecured promissory note bearing interest at 5% (payable in cash or in kind at our option), and convertible into our common shares at $.04 per share (including interest payable in kind). The proceeds of the Loan are intended were used for working capital.

On September 27, 2016, Sky Rover loaned us an additional $2,000,000 to the Registrant. Sky Rover was issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Note) which is due in three years (on September 27, 2019), and is convertible into the Registrants common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.04 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.). The $2,000,000 Note bears interest of 5% per annum, with interest payable quarterly, in cash or, at the Registrants option, the issuance to Sky Rover of restricted shares of the Registrants common stock at the conversion price of $.04 per share.

On February 23, 2017, Sky Rover loaned an additional $1,000,000 to the Company. Sky Rover was issued an unsecured, 5%, convertible promissory note which is due on February 23, 2020, and is convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder, into common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $0.08 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.). At the option of the Company, the interest may also be paid by issuing restricted shares of common stock, at the same conversion price per share. All funds expended to date have been used for professional fees, other general operating purposes and for payments in accordance with the SOWs.

On February 26, 2017, Sky Rover agreed to loan us up to an additional $20,000,000 to the Registrant, of which $8,000,000 was loaned to the Registrant on February 28, 2017. The loan of the $8,000,000, combined with the $4,000,000 which was loaned to the Registrant by Sky Rover since August, 2016, means that Sky Rover has loaned a total of $12,000,000 in convertible notes to the Registrant since August, 2016. Sky Rover and the Registrant have not determined when the balance of the $20,000,000 loan will be completed, and it is subject to the terms being agreed upon, i.e., the interest rate, conversion price, and due date.

The terms for the $8,000,000 loan which was made by Sky Rover to the Registrant on February 28, 2017 are evidenced by a promissory note (the  $8,000,000 Note) issued to Sky Rover, with the following terms: the $8,000,000 Note is unsecured, bears interest at 5% per year (payable quarterly in cash or in stock, in Registrants option, at the conversion price), is due in three years (on February 26, 2020), and is convertible into the Registrants common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.08 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.). The Registrant and its affiliate Sky Rover intend, but cannot confirm at this time, that the conversion price of any of the up to $12,000,000 additional loans will be at a conversion price at least equal to the $.08 conversion price of the $8,000,000 loan.

If and when Sky Rover converts the entire $8,000,000 Note at the present conversion price of $.08 per share to 100,000,000 shares, and assuming that Sky Rover also converts the $4,000,000 in notes which Sky Rover also holds, at the conversion price of $.04 per share, Sky Rover would be issued a total of 187,500,000 restricted shares of the Registrants common stock. Those shares, plus the 6,000,000 shares Mr. Pei currently owns, would give him beneficial ownership of 193,500,000 of the Registrants 195,630,000 then-issued and outstanding shares (assuming that no other shares are issued before conversion), which would be approximately 98.9% of the then-outstanding shares. 

The Registrant intends to use the proceeds of these $12,000,000 in loans to complete the development of a blockchain empowered platform to link online games with players who would like to earn points while playing games. The points accumulated over time could appreciate in value, and would be available for potential cashout; and the blockchain technology is intended to make "playing games and earning points" more secure and transparent. The Registrant intends to partner with other experienced third party service providers and marketing firms to match online games with players on our platform.

As of the date of the issuance of the $8,000,000 Note, the Registrant had 250,000,000 authorized common shares, $.001 par value, which would not be enough authorized shares if the $8,000,000 Note and the $4,000,000 in previously issued notes were converted immediately. So, the Registrant, by consent of Mr. Pei, the majority shareholder, caused the Registrant to increase its authorized common shares to 500,000,000, $.001 par value. The Registrant also has authorized 50,000,000 Preferred Shares, $.001 par value, containing such rights, powers, designations, preferences, liquidation and conversion rights, and other terms, as are set forth in each issuance of Preferred Shares in a resolution of the Board of Directors.

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no Preferred Shares have been issued, and the Registrant has no current plans or agreements which would require the issuance of any Preferred Shares.

On August 6, 2016 the Company signed Statements of Work (SOWs) with Intellectsoft LLC, an unaffiliated company, to perform services for the development and administration of websites to support a mobile app which will enable consumers to purchase goods with Future World Group vouchers, and merchants will be able to sell their goods directly to the users, using this platform. 

The SOWs provide that after this mobile app has been developed, Intellectsoft LLC will then proceed to phase 2, which is intended to be the development of this app for trade centers.

As of May 31, 2017 and the date of this Report on Form 10-K, the Company has paid $2,836,832 and $3,199,166, respectively, to Intellectsoft LLC.
In addition to the SOWs with Intellectsoft, between August 20, 2016 and September 27, 2016, the Registrant signed five SOWs with hedgehog lab, an unaffiliated UK-based company which is also unaffiliated with Intellectsoft to provide additional services to the registrant in connection with the app being developed. The objective of these services, to be completed in two phases, includes (1) creating a white labelled version of Future World which can be packaged up in a way by which small co-operatives of merchants can create their own eco systems of product selling and loyalty point trading, using Future Vouchers; (2) taking the current version of the app, improving the identified pain points and providing versions in English and Chinese, to allow the app to be used in Asia, Europe and North America, by the merchants and customers in as short a time as possible; (3) having a loyalty point trading platform visualized within the new iOS and Android applications, as well as defining the distribution of future vouchers and loyalty points; and (4) the creation of a prototype of a 3D globe system, visualizing the potential for the globalization of the app into cities.


2

As of May 31, 2017 and the date of this Report on Form 10-K, the Company has paid $1,872,689 and $2,002,964, respectively, to hedgehog lab.

As a result of the Company signing these SOWs in August, 2016, and paying the amounts set forth above, the Company determined that it is executing its business plan, and is therefore no longer a shell, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.

Our financial statements report no revenue since inception, an accumulated deficit of $5,167,026 as of May 31, 2017 and a net loss of $5,053,337for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for our Company, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to successfully acquire assets or a business, we may fail.
