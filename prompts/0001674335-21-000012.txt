Item 1 - Business.
Our Company
    We are one of the world’s largest door and window manufacturers. We design, produce, and distribute an extensive range of interior and exterior doors, windows, and related products for use in the new construction and R&R of residential single and multi-family homes and, to a lesser extent, non-residential buildings. 
    We market our products globally under the JELD-WEN brand along with several market-leading regional brands, such as Swedoor and DANA in Europe and Corinthian, Stegbar, and Trend in Australia. Our customers include wholesale distributors and retailers as well as individual contractors and consumers. Our business is highly diversified by distribution channel, geography, and construction application as illustrated below: 

2020 Net Revenues $4,236 million


Channel | Geography | Construction Application(1)

(1)Percentage of net revenues by construction application is management’s estimate based on the end markets into which our customers sell.
    As one of the largest door and window companies in the world, we have invested significant capital to build a business platform that we believe is unique among our competitors. We operate approximately 140 manufacturing and distribution facilities in 19 countries, located primarily in North America, Europe, and Australia. Our global manufacturing footprint is strategically sized and located to meet the delivery requirements of our customers. For many product lines, our manufacturing processes are vertically integrated, enhancing our range of capabilities, our ability to innovate, and our quality control, as well as providing us with supply chain, transportation, and working capital savings. We believe that our manufacturing network allows us to deliver our broad portfolio of products to a wide range of customers across the globe, while improving our customer service and strengthening our market positions.
Our History
    We were founded in 1960 by Richard L. Wendt, when he, together with four business partners, bought a millwork plant in Oregon. The subsequent decades were a time of successful expansion and growth as we added different businesses and product categories such as interior doors, exterior steel doors, and vinyl windows. Our first overseas acquisition was Norma Doors in Spain in 1992 and since then we have acquired or established numerous businesses in Europe, Australia, Asia, Canada, and Mexico, making us a truly global company. 
    In October 2011, certain funds managed by affiliates of Onex acquired a majority of the combined voting power in the Company through the acquisition of convertible debt and convertible preferred equity. After the Onex investment, we began the transformation of our business from a family-run operation to a global organization with independent, professional management. The transformation accelerated after 2013 with the hiring of a new senior management team strategically recruited from a number of world-class industrial companies. Our current management team has extensive experience driving operational improvement, innovation, and growth, both organically and through acquisitions. As of December 31, 2020, Onex owned approximately 32.6% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock.

In February 2017, we completed an initial public offering of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “JELD.”
Our Business Strategy and Operating Model
We strive to achieve best-in-industry financial performance and shareholder returns through the disciplined execution of our strategic growth drivers which include:
•initiatives to drive profitable organic revenue growth, including new product development and innovation, investments in our brands and marketing, commercial excellence programs such as customer segmentation, and pricing optimization; 
•an operational excellence model designed to improve our profit margins, including lean tools to drive manufacturing productivity savings and cycle time improvements, as well as fixed-cost savings and quality enhancements from our global facility rationalization and modernization initiative; 
•high conversion of earnings to free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation designed to maximize shareholder returns in a balanced manner between debt reduction, strategic acquisitions, and share repurchases; and 
•growing a premier performing culture with high employee engagement, supported by our values and a relentless focus on talent management.
The execution of our strategy is supported and enabled by a relentless focus on the deployment of the JELD-WEN Excellence Model, or JEM, which is our global business operating system. JEM creates a culture of continuous improvement through standard work, problem solving tools, and lean thinking. We believe that JEM is the foundation to drive business transformation across all aspects of the entire global enterprise. Over the long term, we believe that the implementation of these strategic drivers is largely within our control and is less dependent on external factors. 
Our Products
    We provide a broad portfolio of interior and exterior doors, windows, and related products manufactured from a variety of wood, metal, and composite materials offered across a full spectrum of price points. In the year ended December 31, 2020, our door sales accounted for 65% of net revenues, our window sales accounted for 20% of net revenues, and our other ancillary products and services accounted for 15% of net revenues. 
Doors 
    We are a leading global manufacturer of residential doors. We offer a full line of residential interior and exterior door products, including patio doors and folding or sliding wall systems. Our non-residential door product offering is concentrated in Europe, where we are a leading non-residential door provider by net revenues in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavia. In order to meet the design, durability, and energy efficiency requirements of our customers, our product portfolio encompasses many types of materials, including wood veneer, composite wood, steel, glass, and fiberglass that satisfy a range of price points from mid-level to high-end. Our highest volume products include molded interior doors, which are made from two composite molded door skins joined by a wooden frame and filled with a hollow honey-cell core or other solid core materials. These low-cost doors are the most popular choice for interior residential applications in North America and are also prevalent in France and the U.K. In the U.S., we manufacture exterior doors primarily made from fiberglass and steel. Fiberglass has grown in popularity due to its attractive thermal properties, aesthetics, and durability. We have dedicated additional resources to our exterior fiberglass door business, which includes door slabs and door systems, and believe we have a leading product offering based on quality, breadth of design options, and range of price points. In Europe, we also sell highly engineered non-residential doors, with features such as soundproofing, fire resistance, radiation resistance, and added security. We also manufacture stile and rail doors in our Southeast Asia and U.S. manufacturing facilities. In the U.S., we also manufacture folding and sliding wall systems. Additionally, we offer profitable value-added distribution services in all of our markets, including customizable configuration services, specialized component options, and multiple finishing options. These services are valued by labor constrained customers and allow us to capture more profit from the sale of our door products. In the U.S., our acquisitions of ABS and MMI Door are examples of our increased focus on value-added services. 
Windows 
    We are a leading global manufacturer of residential windows. We manufacture wood, vinyl, aluminum, and wood composite windows in North America, wood and aluminum windows in Australia, and wood windows in the U.K. Our window product lines comprise a full range of styles, features, and energy-saving options in order to meet the varied needs of our customers in each of our regional end markets. For example, our high-performance wood and vinyl windows with multi-pane glazing and superior energy efficiency properties are in greater demand in Canada and the northern U.S. By contrast, our lower-cost aluminum framed windows are popular in some regions of the southern U.S., while in coastal Florida certain local building codes require windows that can

withstand the impact of debris propelled by hurricane-force winds. Wood windows are prevalent as a high-end option in all of our markets because they possess both insulating qualities and the beauty of natural wood. In North America, our wood windows and patio doors include our proprietary AuraLast treatment, which is a unique water-based wood protection process that provides protection against wood rot and decay. We believe AuraLast is unique in its ability to penetrate and protect the wood through to the core, as opposed to being a shallow or surface-only treatment. Our most recent windows product introductions showcase our differentiated capability utilizing alternative materials including our Auraline wood composite window and patio doors. Additionally, with the acquisition of VPI, we added vinyl windows for mid-rise, multi-family, institutional, hospitality, and commercial properties to our product lineup. Our windows typically retail at prices ranging from $100 to $200 for a basic vinyl window to over $1,000 for a custom energy-efficient wood window. We believe that our innovative energy-efficient windows position us to benefit from increasing environmental awareness among consumers and from changes in local building codes. In recognition of our expansive energy-efficient product line, we have been an ENERGY STAR partner since 1998. 
Other Ancillary Products and Services 
    In certain regions, we sell a variety of other products that are ancillary to our door and window offerings, which we do not classify as door or window sales. These products include shower enclosures and wardrobes, moldings, trim board, lumber, cutstock, glass, staircases, hardware and locks, cabinets, and screens. We also sell molded door skins to certain customers pursuant to long-term contracts, and these customers in turn use the molded door skins to manufacture interior doors and compete directly against us in the marketplace. Miscellaneous installation and other services are also included in this category. 
Our Segments
    We operate within the global market for residential and non-residential doors and windows with sales spanning approximately 100 countries. While we operate globally, the markets for doors and windows are regionally distinct with suppliers manufacturing finished goods in proximity to their customers. Finished doors and windows are generally bulky, expensive to ship, and, in the case of windows, fragile. Designs and specifications of doors and windows also vary from country to country due to differing construction methods, building codes, certification requirements, and consumer preferences. Customers also demand short delivery times and can require special order customizations. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet the global demands of our customers due to our market leadership, strong brands, broad product line, and strategically located manufacturing and distribution facilities. 
    Our operations are managed and reported in three reportable segments, organized and managed principally by geographic region. Our reportable segments are North America, Europe, and Australasia. We report all other business activities in Corporate and unallocated costs. Factors considered in determining the three reportable segments include the nature of business activities, the management structure accountable directly to the CODM for operating and administrative activities, the discrete financial information available, and the information regularly presented to the CODM.
North America
    In our North America segment, we compete primarily in the market for residential doors and windows in the U.S. and Canada. We are the only manufacturer that offers a full line of interior and exterior door and window products, allowing us to offer a more complete solution to our customer base. We believe that our leading position in the North American market will enable us to benefit from continued growth in residential construction activity over the next several years. We believe that our total market opportunity in North America also includes non-residential applications, other related building products, and value-added services. 
Europe 
    The European market for doors is highly fragmented and we have the only platform in the industry capable of serving nearly all European countries. In our Europe segment, we compete primarily in the market for residential and non-residential doors in Germany, the U.K., France, Austria, Switzerland, and Scandinavia. We believe that our total market opportunity in Europe also includes other European countries, other door product lines, related building products, and value-added services. New construction and R&R activity is expected to remain stable over the next several years and we believe opportunity in Europe includes the introduction of new product offerings.
Back to top

Australasia 
    In our Australasia segment, we compete primarily in the market for residential doors and windows in Australia, where we hold a leading position by net revenues. We believe that our total market opportunity in the Australasia region includes other countries in the region, as well as non-residential applications, other related building products, and value-added services. For example, we also sell a full line of shower enclosures and closet systems throughout Australia. The market for residential new construction in Australia contracted over the last two years, primarily due to government-imposed rules that restricted credit availability for homebuyers, increased immigration restrictions limiting population growth due to COVID-19, and continued downward economic results further extended due to the pandemic. While the Australian government has taken accommodative actions to increase credit availability and spur demand growth, the market for new home construction is expected to remain soft throughout 2021.
    Financial information regarding our segments is included in Note 16 - Segment Information to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
Materials
    Historically our sourcing function operated primarily in a regional, decentralized model. Over the past several years we have turned global sourcing into a competitive advantage by building a centralized global sourcing team focused on minimizing material costs through strategic global sourcing and value-added re-engineering of components. We believe leveraging our significant spending and the global nature of our purchases will allow us to achieve these goals. 
    We generally maintain a diversified supply base for the materials used in our manufacturing operations. The primary materials used for our door business include wood, wood veneers, wood composites, steel, glass, internally produced door skins, fiberglass compound, and hardware, as well as petroleum-based products such as resin and binders. The primary materials for our window business include wood, wood components, glass, hardware, as well as aluminum and vinyl extrusions. Wood components for our window operations are sourced primarily from our own manufacturing plants, which allow us to improve margins and take advantage of our proprietary technologies such as our AuraLast wood treatment process. 
    We track commodities in order to understand our vendors’ costs, realizing that our costs are determined by the broader competitive market as well as by increases in the inputs to our vendors. In order to manage the risk in material costs, we develop strategic relationships with suppliers, routinely evaluate substitute components, develop new products, vertically integrate, where applicable, and seek alternative sources of supply from multiple vendors and often from multiple geographies. 
Seasonality
    In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, peak season for home construction and remodeling in our North America and Europe segments, which represent the substantial majority of our revenues, generally corresponds with the second and third calendar quarters, and therefore our sales volume is usually higher during those quarters. Seasonal variations in operating results may be impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects. 
Sales and Marketing
    We actively market and sell our products directly to our customers around the world through our global sales force and indirectly through our marketing and branding initiatives, which includes our enhanced social media presence. Our global sales force, which is organized and managed regionally, focuses on building and maintaining relationships with key customers as well as managing customer supply needs and arranging in-store promotional initiatives. In North America, we also have a dedicated team that focuses on our large home center customers. We have recently made significant investments in tools and technologies to enhance the effectiveness of our sales force and improve ease of doing business. For example, we are in the process of deploying Salesforce.com on a global basis, which will provide us with a common global customer relationship management platform. In addition, we are investing in our online ordering tools to simplify our order entry process. We have introduced an electronic ordering system for easy order placement, and we are expanding our online retail sales.
    We have restructured the commission and incentive plans of our sales team to drive focus on achieving profitable growth. We have also invested significantly in our architectural sales force by adding staff and tools to increase the frequency with which our products are specified by architects and, more recently, have restructured the North America sales team focused on our traditional distribution channel, from a single team to product focused teams. We believe these investments will increase sales force effectiveness, create pull-through demand, and optimize sales force productivity. 
    We believe that our broad product portfolio of both doors and windows in North America and Australasia is a competitive advantage as it allows us to cross-sell our door and window products to our end customers, many of whom find it more efficient to choose one supplier for their door and window needs on a given project. None of our primary competitors in these regions offers a similarly complete range of windows as well as interior and exterior doors.

Research and Development 
    A core aspect of our business strategy is the investment and innovation of new products and technologies. We believe that leading the market in innovation will enhance demand for our products and allow us to sell a higher margin product mix. Our research and development efforts encompass new product development, derivative product development, as well as value added re-engineering of components in our existing products leading to reduced costs and manufacturing efficiencies. We have also designed a new governance process that prioritizes the most impactful projects, which is expected to improve the efficiency and quality of our research and development efforts. The governance process is currently being deployed globally, such that we can leverage best practices from region to region. Additionally, a substantial driver of our acquisition activity has been increasing access to new and innovative products, including the transfer and integration of acquired technology. 
    Although product specifications and certifications vary from country to country, the global nature of our operations allows us to leverage our global innovation capabilities and share new product designs across our markets. We believe that the global nature of our research and development capabilities is unique among our door and window competition. An example of global sharing of innovation is the Shaker door series, which is manufactured at our Indonesia operations and is now offered to our North American customers. Additionally, we have successfully launched new door designs into our North American market, including our Moda Door Collection that was originally developed for the Australian market.
Customers
    We sell our products worldwide and have well-established relationships with numerous customers throughout the door and window distribution chain in each of our end markets, including retail home centers, wholesale distributors, and building product dealers that supply homebuilders, contractors, and consumers. Our wholesale customers include such industry leaders as ProBuild/Builders First Source (which also includes BMC/Stock Building Supply), Saint-Gobain, and the Holzring group. Our home center customers include, among others, The Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menards in North America; B&Q, Howdens, and Bauhaus in Europe; and Bunnings Warehouse in Australia. We have maintained relationships with the majority of our top ten customers for over 20 years and believe that the strength and tenure of our customer relationships is based on the total value we provide, including the quality and breadth of our product offering, our customer service, innovation, and delivery capabilities. Our top ten customers together accounted for 40% of our net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020, and our largest customer, The Home Depot, accounted for approximately 15% of our net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Competition
    The door and window industry is highly competitive and includes a number of regional and international competitors. Competition is largely based on the functional and aesthetic quality of products, service quality, distribution capability, and price. We believe that we are well-positioned in our industry due to our leading brands, our broad product lines, our consistently high product quality and service, our global manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and our extensive multi-channel distribution. For North American interior doors, our major competitors include Masonite and several smaller independent door manufacturers. For North American exterior doors, competitors include Masonite, Therma-Tru (a division of Fortune Brands), and Plastpro. The North American window market is highly fragmented, with sizable competitors including Andersen, Pella, Marvin, Ply-Gem (a division of Cornerstone Building Brands, formerly NCI Building Systems), and Milgard (a division of MI Windows and Doors). The door manufacturers that we primarily compete with in our European markets include Huga, Prüm/Garant (a division of Arbonia Group), Viljandi, Masonite, Keyor, and Herholz. The competitive landscape in Australia is varied across the door and window markets. In the Australian door market, Hume Doors is our primary competitor, while in the window, shower screen, and wardrobe markets we largely compete against a fragmented set of smaller companies. 
Intellectual Property
    We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Generally, registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain the trademark registrations listed below so long as they remain valuable to our business. 
    Our U.S. window and door trademarks include JELD-WEN®, AuraLast®, VPI™, MiraTEC®, Extira®, LaCANTINA®, Karona®, ImpactGard®, JW®, Aurora®, MMI Door®, IWP®, True BLU®, and ABS®. Our trademarks are either registered or have long been used as a common law trademark by the Company. The trademarks we use outside the U.S. include the Stegbar®, Regency®, William Russell Doors®, Airlite®, Trend®, The Perfect Fit™, Aneeta®, Breezway®, Kolder™, Corinthian®, and A&L® marks in Australia, and Swedoor®, Dooria®, DANA®, Mattiovi™, Alupan®, and Domoferm® in Europe.

Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters
Human Capital Resources
We believe that the success of our mission is realized by the engagement and empowerment of our employees and we are committed to investing in our people. Our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Human Resources, is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, retention, development, and engagement of talent. In addition, our Executive Vice President, Human Resources regularly updates senior management and our Board of Directors on the operation and status of our human capital management. 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed over 23,000 people. Of our total number of employees, approximately 11,500 are employed in operations included in our North America segment and corporate operations, approximately 7,300 are employed in operations included in our Europe segment, and approximately 4,200 are employed in operations included in our Australasia segment. 
    In total, approximately 1,140, or 10%, of our employees in the U.S. and Canada are unionized. Two facilities in the U.S., representing approximately 330 employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In Canada, approximately 71% of our employees work at facilities covered by collective bargaining agreements. As is common in Europe and Australia, the majority of our facilities are covered by work councils and/or labor agreements. We believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees and our organized labor unions. 
Health and Safety
We strive to operate in a way that prioritizes the health and safety of our employees, business partners, and the communities in which we operate. JELD-WEN's commitment to the environmental health and safety (“EH&S”) of our associates is foundational and embedded in our values. Nothing takes precedence over safety. Our EH&S programs are designed around global policies and standards and a commitment to complying with or exceeding applicable requirements within our manufacturing, service and install, and headquarter operations. We proactively implement management systems consistent with ISO 14001 and 45001 requirements to prevent EH&S risks and to create a strong safety culture and improve performance. We are committed to continuous improvement and continue to measure, refine, and improve on our performance. We educate and train our employees to ensure compliance with our policies, standards, and management systems. We also have policies and procedures in place to encourage employees to stop work to address at-risk conditions without the threat of retaliation. Our management and Board of Directors also periodically review our health and safety practices to address ongoing effectiveness and compliance. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse and engaged workforce is a strong competitive advantage and we strive to create an environment where individuals of all backgrounds can fully contribute and maximize their potential. Our employees are encouraged to bring their authentic selves to the workplace and work together to enrich a culture of inclusivity and belonging. Senior leadership teams review their succession plans, as well as their broader workforce demographics, on a regular cadence to ensure underrepresented groups are being offered fair consideration for open roles and internal promotions. We believe diversity and inclusion begins as we source potential talent for the Company. We recruit from historically black colleges and universities, partner with affinity groups and veterans’ organizations, and work with minority owned recruiting firms to ensure managers are presented with diverse candidate pools for their workforce needs. As part of our human capital strategy we incorporate mentoring programs, support employee resources groups, and facilitate training sessions into our annual initiatives. 
Training and Talent Development
We strive to not only attract and retain great talent but are committed to the continued development of our workforce. We invest in formal leadership development programs that help prepare senior leaders for succession into executive roles, in regional programs to accelerate the leadership conversion of mid-level managers, and in focused efforts to upskill our front-line leaders. Retaining and developing early career talent is an additional focus. Across our teams, we welcome apprenticeship and work study arrangements that seed talent into manufacturing and team lead roles. In North America specifically, we offer a summer internship program and a multi-year cross-functional rotational program to identify, attract, and accelerate the growth of an internal pipeline of future managers. In our regions, we seek out, seed, and utilize financial grants and social educational investment requirements to reinvest in the ongoing learning and development needs of our diverse global workforce. 
Internal job opportunities are posted for employees to review and our internal mobility philosophy encourages employees to apply for roles after they have passed 12 months on a job. Our human capital management system allows employees to document their skills, prior work experiences, and desired future areas of growth. As part of the annual performance management process, managers and employees meet to review individual development plans and discuss actions for ongoing growth and development. The company continues to invest in its employees through new global learning platforms, content libraries, and additional formal and informal training programs.

Employee Engagement
We manage and measure our organizational health with a view to gaining insight into our employees’ experiences, levels of workplace satisfaction, and feelings of engagement within the Company. We measure employee engagement and manager effectiveness annually through our global census survey and strive to increase our engagement scores year over year. To assist in this formal effort, all people managers are given direct access to their engagement results, share these results with their teams, and create measurable action plans. The Senior Leadership Team demonstrates their commitment to engagement through transparent communications in town halls and leadership team meetings; they also carry engagement goals on their individual annual goal plans. Engagement is also managed and measured at the local level. Each region, as well as the local facilities, host engagement events that align to the Company values of Investing in People, while also positively impacting the communities in which we work and live. 
Environmental Sustainability
    We strive to conduct our business in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and demonstrates environmental stewardship. Toward that end, we pursue processes that are designed to minimize waste, maximize efficient utilization of materials, and conserve resources, including using recycled and reused materials to produce portions of our products. We offer a variety of products that contain pre-consumer recycled content, such as our vinyl windows, aluminum cladding, and window glass. Our U.S. produced pine wood windows and select patio doors and door frames are made from AuraLast® pine, which is a proprietary, water-based wood protection process that results in a decrease of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) released during production. In addition, we manufacture many products that meet local green building provisions and top nationally recognized environmental programs. We continue to evaluate and modify our manufacturing and other processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce our impact on the environment. 
Environmental Regulatory Actions
    The geographic breadth of our facilities and the nature of our operations subject us to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in jurisdictions throughout the world. Such laws and regulations relate to, among other things, air emissions, the treatment and discharge of wastewater, the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the handling, storage, use and disposal of solid, hazardous and other wastes, worker health and safety, or otherwise relate to health, safety, and protection of the environment. Many of our products are also subject to various laws and regulations, such as building and construction codes, product safety regulations, and regulations and mandates related to energy efficiency. 
    The nature of our operations, which involve the handling, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous wastes, exposes us to the risk of liability and claims associated with contamination at our current and former facilities or sites where we have disposed of or arranged for the disposal of waste, or with the impact of our products on human health and safety and the environment. Laws and regulations with respect to the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous materials upon statutorily defined parties, including us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. We have been subject to claims, including having been named as a potentially responsible party, in certain proceedings initiated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and similar state and foreign laws, regulations, and statutes, and may be named a potentially responsible party in other similar proceedings in the future. Unforeseen expenditures or liabilities may arise in connection with such matters.
    We have also been the subject of certain environmental regulatory actions by the EPA and state regulatory agencies in the U.S. and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate and are obligated to make certain expenditures in settlement of those actions. We do not expect expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or competitive position. However, the discovery of a presently unknown environmental condition, changes in environmental requirements or their enforcement, or other unanticipated events, may give rise to unforeseen expenditures and liabilities which could be material.
Back to top

In 2008, we entered into an Agreed Order with the WADOE to assess historic environmental contamination and remediation feasibility at our former manufacturing site in Everett, Washington. As part of this agreement, we also agreed to develop a Corrective Action Plan (“CAP”), arising from the feasibility assessment. On April 30, 2020, we provided the WADOE with a revised draft of our feasibility assessment. On June 19, 2020, we received substantive comments from the WADOE that included additional remedial alternatives and changes to the scoring of the alternatives. We worked with WADOE on its comments with respect to and the scoring of the remedial alternatives, and we submitted the draft final feasibility assessment to the WADOE in December 2020, which we considered substantially complete. The draft final feasibility assessment included remedial alternatives ranging from $8.3 million to $57.0 million. We expect to deliver a draft CAP to the WADOE in late-April 2021. The final feasibility assessment and draft final of the CAP are expected to be delivered to the WADOE in May 2021. At that time, the WADOE will release the documents to the public for a 30-day comment period. Once the public comment period has expired and any comments incorporated, the WADOE will select the remedial actions we will be required to perform, and a final CAP will be developed and delivered to the WADOE 15 days thereafter. While we have made provisions in our financial statements within the range of possible outcomes for this matter, it is unclear at this time which remedial actions we will be required to undertake or the cost thereof. As a result, the cost of the final CAP could vary materially from our provisions and have a material impact on our statement of operations and statement of cash flows.
    In December 2020, we entered into a COA with the PaDEP to remove a pile of wood fiber waste from our site in Towanda, Pennsylvania, which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of CMI in 2013, by using it as fuel for a boiler at that site. The COA replaced a 2018 Consent Decree between PaDep and us. Under the COA, we are required to achieve certain periodic removal objectives and ultimately remove the entire pile by August 31, 2025. There are currently $2.3 million in bonds posted in connection with these obligations. If we are unable to remove this pile by August 31, 2025, then the bonds will be forfeited, and we may be subject to penalties by PaDEP. We currently anticipate meeting all applicable removal deadlines; however, if our operations at this site decrease and we burn less fuel than currently anticipated, we may not be able to meet such deadlines.

Government Regulation
As a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. These regulations, which differ among jurisdictions, include those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, privacy, and anti-corruption, in addition to the environmental laws and regulations described above.
For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.
