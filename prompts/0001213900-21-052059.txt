Overview



At SunHydrogen, our goal is to replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable hydrogen.



Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical element in the universe. When hydrogen fuel is used to power transportation and industry, the only byproduct left behind is pure water, unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas that release carbon dioxide and other contaminants into the atmosphere when used. However, naturally occurring elemental hydrogen is rare – so rare, in fact, that today over 95% of hydrogen still comes from methane, a fossil fuel (Source: Forbes, Estimating the Carbon Footprint of Hydrogen Production). This hydrogen is procured through steam methane reforming (SMR), a capital-intensive process that emits carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants.



The SunHydrogen solution offers an efficient and cost-effective way to produce truly green hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water. Our core technology is a self-contained, nanoparticle-based hydrogen generator that mimics photosynthesis to split water molecules, resulting in hydrogen. By optimizing the science of water electrolysis at the nano-level, we believe we have developed a low-cost method to potentially produce environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen.



We believe renewable hydrogen is the fuel of the future, and we believe our technology potentially offers solutions to the challenges that the hydrogen future presents, including cost of production and transportation.



Because our process only requires sunlight and water, our technology can be installed near the point of hydrogen use. This eliminates the need for pipelines and trucks that result in high carbon emissions and high capital investment. With a target cost of $2.50/kg., we aspire for our technology to be cost-competitive with brown hydrogen and below the cost of clean hydrogen competitors. We believe our solution has the potential to clear a path for green hydrogen to compete with natural gas hydrogen and gain mass market acceptance as a true replacement for fossil fuels.



Our technology is primarily developed at the University of Iowa, through a sponsored research agreement. A longtime development partner to SunHydrogen, The University of Iowa research team has worked over the past several years to both lead and optimize the scale-up of our nanoparticle technology.



In 2021, we made strides toward the commercialization of our nanoparticle technology and entered agreements with two new technology development partners; InRedox in Longmont, Colorado and SCHMID Group in Freudenstadt, Germany.



Under our agreement with InRedox, they support the design and production of essential materials for our nanoparticle technology.



Concurrently, SCHMID has worked to develop the process and equipment to manufacture and scale up our nanoparticle technology.




In 2021, we also successfully completed production of 100 demonstration units of our Gen 1 technology, and added a Chief Operating Officer, Woosuk Kim, a seasoned senior operations executive with global business management and financial market expertise spanning the U.S. and Wall Street, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

We will continue working diligently with our existing technology partners to drive our technology to commercialization while we simultaneously prepare for mass production and seek out potential manufacturing partners for production facility, equipment design and engineering.



Market Opportunity



The global hydrogen market is large and growing rapidly. Current fossil fuels can’t sustain future energy requirements environmentally or economically, and hydrogen fuel technologies are being adopted across all sectors as the world moves toward renewable alternatives.



Over 110 countries have set goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and as governments look to clean energy sources to help them meet their targets, hydrogen is emerging as a promising solution (Source: United Nations, The race to zero emissions, and why the world depends on it). It is estimated that nearly 25% of global energy will come from clean hydrogen alone by 2050, which could bring in a projected $2.5 trillion in annual revenues (Source: Bank of America Securities, New Energy Behind Green Hydrogen).



In the US, California is leading the way in hydrogen strategies, with more fuel cell passenger vehicles on the road than any other state and one of the largest hydrogen refueling station networks in the world (Source: Sierra Nevada Ally, Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles are Building Momentum in California). Globally, over 320 green hydrogen production demonstration projects have been announced, and governments around the world have put forth ambitious strategies to utilize hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across all sectors of the economy including transportation, feedstock and industrial heat use (Source: International Energy Agency, Hydrogen Projects Database).



By 2050, the hydrogen market is expected to increase tenfold compared to where it stands today (Source: The Hydrogen Council, Hydrogen, scaling up).



Existing Market Growth 



According to a Grand View Research study released in March 2021, the global hydrogen generation market size was valued at $120.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7% from 2021 to 2028. This places the market’s projected value at $184 billion in 2028.



Among the factors driving the global hydrogen generation market size are regulations intended to reduce sulfur content and measures to reduce the carbon footprint. U.S. federal and state governments have adopted various programs, including the Tier 3 program, to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline, motor oil and diesel.



Growing demand for petroleum products from developing countries is also anticipated to drive the hydrogen generation market in the coming years. Hydrogen is used in various refining processes including hydrocracking and hydrodesulfurization to crack bigger molecules into lighter ones and produce more usable products.



We believe increasing demand for clean fuel energy will be affected by:




● | Stringent government regulation toward desulphurization of petroleum products
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deteriorating crude oil quality; and
--+-------------------------------------


● | Transportation and storage issues
--+----------------------------------




Therefore, we believe our renewable hydrogen-producing technology possesses significant early market opportunity, especially as innovation and infrastructure continue to develop.

Utility Scale Hydrogen Electricity



According to a March 2013 report from NREL, a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, hydrogen can be blended into existing natural gas pipeline networks, thus bypassing the high cost of dedicated hydrogen pipelines to use hydrogen at a large scale. If implemented with relatively low concentrations, less than 5%–15% hydrogen by volume, this strategy of storing and delivering renewable hydrogen to markets appears to be viable without significantly increasing risks associated with utilization of the gas blend in end-use devices (such as household appliances), overall public safety, or the durability and integrity of the existing natural gas pipeline network (Source: NREL, Blending Hydrogen into Natural Gas Pipeline Networks: A review of Key Issues).



Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles



The auto manufacturing and vehicle industries are among the most recognized applications for hydrogen fuel technologies. According to a 2021 study by Information Trends, over 27,500 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles had been sold by year-end 2020 since their sales first began. Sales were held back due to the lack of a solid hydrogen refueling infrastructure, but the numbers are projected to rise quickly, and fuel cell vehicles are gaining momentum around the world. In the same study, Information Trends projected that close to 600,000 hydrogen fuel cell buses and minibuses will be in service by 2035 (Source: Information Trends, Global Market for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Buses). In California, executives from 25 multinational companies including Toyota, Hyundai, BMW, Chevron and other key players have called on Governor Gavin Newsom to heavily invest in hydrogen infrastructure in the state (Source: Ways2H, Executives Pen Letter to Newsom Calling for Major Investments in Hydrogen Infrastructure). Stories and projections like these suggest a promising future for fuel cell vehicles.



Our Technology



Technology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight and Water



Powered by solar energy, billions of our microscopic nanoparticles split apart water at the molecular level, extracting hydrogen for use as a clean energy source and leaving behind only clean oxygen as a byproduct. This process is similar to what happens inside a plant cell during photosynthesis: Each Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures (or PAH) nanoparticle is a microscopic machine, composed of multiple layers enabling the solar electrolysis reaction to take place.
Water Splitting



In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds. Essentially, manufactured hydrogen serves as a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable, such as solar or wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen.



While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable:




● | Energy Inefficiency — Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes resulting in only a small portion of electricity making it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. We intend to address this problem with our low-cost and energy efficient particle technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Need for Clean Water — Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using large quantities of available water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. Our technology is being designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology



Water electrolysis in its simplest form is the transfer of “input electrons” in the following chemical reactions:




● | Cathode (reduction): 2H2O + 2e- ® H2 + 2OH-
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Anode (oxidation): 4OH- ® O2 + 2H2O + 4 e-
--+-------------------------------------------




From these equations, one can deduce that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split each water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available.



SunHydrogen Panel™



Since our particles are intended to mimic the natural temperature conditions of photosynthesis, they can be housed in very low-cost reactors. To facilitate the commercial use of our self-contained particle technology, we are developing a modular system that will enable the onsite daily production and storage of hydrogen for any time use in electricity generation.



We refer to our potential product as the SunHydrogen Panel which is comprised of the following components:



1. The Generator Housing – Our novel device design is the first of its kind to safely separate oxygen and hydrogen in the water splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, and the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gasses. Utilizing a novel ion-exchange membrane strategy for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, ion transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. Our design can be scaled up and manufactured for commercial use.



2. The NanoParticle or Solar Cell - Powered by solar energy, billions of our microscopic nanoparticle solar cells split apart water at the molecular level, extracting hydrogen for use as a clean energy source and leaving behind only clean oxygen as a byproduct.



3. Oxygen Evolution Catalyst - This proprietary catalyst developed at the University of Iowa lab is uniformly applied onto the solar cell or nanoparticle and efficiently oxidize water molecule to generate oxygen gas. The oxygen evolution catalyst must be robust to withstand the long operating hours of the hydrogen generation device to ensure long lifetime. It must be stable in alkaline, neutral and acidic environments.



4. Hydrogen Evolution Catalyst - Necessary for collecting electrons to reduce protons for generating hydrogen gas, we have successfully integrated a low-cost hydrogen catalyst into our generator system, successfully coating a triple junction solar cell with a catalyst comprised primarily of ruthenium, carbon and nitrogen that can function as well as platinum, the current catalyst used for hydrogen production.



5. Coating Technologies - Two major coating technologies were developed to protect the nanoparticles and solar cells from photocorrosion under water: A transparent conducive coating to protect our nanoparticles and solar cells from photo corrosion and efficiently transfer charges to catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions; and a polymer combination that protects the triple junction solar cells from any corrosive water environments for long lifetime of the hydrogen generation device.



In the process of optimizing our nanoparticles to be efficient and only during experimentation with earth abundant materials (an ongoing process), we experimented with commercially available triple junction silicon solar cells to perform tests with our generator housing and other components. Through this experimentation, our discovery led us to believe that we could bring a system (Gen 1) to market utilizing these readily available cells while our nanoparticles are still being optimized. While these solar cells also absorb sunlight and produce the necessary charge for splitting the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, their efficiency is low, thus we have made the strategic decision to focus on our NanoParticle strategy (Gen 2) and use the Gen 1 hydrogen generators for proof of concept and demonstration purposes only. We anticipate these hydrogen panels will be demonstrated in various parts of the world as further proof of concept of our technology and to promote our nanoparticle technology that will be more efficient and economical.

Our business and commercialization plan utilizes our second generation of hydrogen panels featuring the nanoparticle-based technology where billions of autonomous solar cells are electrodeposited onto porous alumina sheets and manufactured in a roll to roll process or wafer process and inserted into our proprietary panels. For this generation, we have received multiple patents and our target cost of hydrogen production is $2.50 per kilogram before pressurization.



We are working with several vendors to help commercialize and manufacture our renewable hydrogen panels that use sunlight and water to generate hydrogen. In February 2021, we entered into a cooperation agreement with Schmid Group of Freudenstadt, Germany to design and define a process platform that enables mass manufacturing of SunHydrogen’s Gen 2 NanoParticle hydrogen panels. In April 2021, we entered into an agreement with InRedox of Longmont, Colorado to produce the material components needed for Gen 2 manufacturing development. Both Schmid and InRedox work alongside the research team at the University of Iowa, a longtime technology development partner to SunHydrogen under sponsored research agreement.



Intellectual Property



On November 14, 2011, we filed a provisional application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property rights for “Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures, methods for their manufacture, and methods and systems for producing desired products.” A year later on November 14, 2012, we filed a non-provisional application claiming priority to the provisional application. On March 14, 2017, a first patent covering the structural design of Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures (PAH) was granted as United States Patent No. 9,593,053B1. A divisional application claiming priority to the foregoing applications was filed, and on April 3, 2018, a second patent covering the method for manufacturing PAH was granted as United States Patent No. 9,593,053B2. These patents protect the Company’s proprietary design and manufacturing method of a self-contained solar-to-hydrogen device made up of millions of solar-powered water-splitting nanoparticles, per square centimeter. These nanoparticles are coated with a separate patent-pending protective coating that prevents corrosion during extended periods of hydrogen production. The aim of these nanoparticles is high conversion efficiency and low cost. This patent expires on November 14, 2032.



An important aspect of the patented technology referred to in the preceding paragraph is the integrated structures of high-density arrays of nano-sized solar cells as part of hydrogen production nanoparticles. The technology enables manufacturing of ultra-thin sheets for solar-to-hydrogen production, requiring substantially less material as compared to conventional solar cells used in rooftop power applications. 




On March 21, 2014, we jointly filed a provisional application with UCSB for the “Multi-junction artificial photosynthetic cell with enhanced photovoltages.” Thereafter, we filed a non-provisional application on March 16, 2015 and a corresponding PCT Application on March 17, 2015. These applications cover our semiconductor designs to enhance the photovoltages of the nano-sized solar cells in the PAH structures. The semiconductor designs stacking multiple junctions inside the PAH structures would be an efficient and economic solution for the photovoltaic and the photoelectrochemical industries. Patents were granted in Australia in April of 2018, China and Europe in March of 2019, and in the U.S. as United States Patent No. 10,100,415 in October of 2018. A patent application is currently pending in India. This patent expires on March 17, 2025.



On September 26, 2016, we filed jointly with the University of Iowa a provisional application for “Integrated Membrane Solar Fuel Production Assembly” to protect the intellectual property for our generator housing system that safely separates oxygen and hydrogen in the water-splitting process without sacrificing efficiency. This device houses the water, the solar particles/cells and is designed with inlets and outlets for water and gases. Utilizing a special membrane for separating the oxygen side from the hydrogen side, proton transport is increased which is the key to safely increasing solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. On September 26, 2017, we filed a PCT Application that was later nationalized in the U.S. on March 26, 2019. The U.S. patent application for this important invention is pending and prosecution is ongoing.

Strategic Partners



As of September 1, 2021, we have renewed our sponsored research agreement with the University of Iowa, As consideration under the research agreement, the University of Iowa will receive a maximum of $299,966 from the Company. The research agreement may be terminated by either party upon 60 days prior written notice or by either party upon notice of a material breach or default which is not cured within 90 days of receipt of written notice of such breach. This term of the research agreement runs through August 31, 2022 but may be extended upon mutual agreement of the parties.



In February 2021, we entered into a cooperation agreement with SCHMID Group of Freudenstadt, Germany. Due to delays associated with supply chain challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, the cooperation agreement has been extended to fully complete the work scope with no additional cost to the company.



In April 2021, we entered into an additional agreement with InRedox of Longmont, Colorado to support the design and production of essential materials for our nanoparticle technology.



Competition



Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane. This production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas. Partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas. The third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal. The current industry is heavily dominated by large players such as Air Products, Chemicals Inc. and Air Liquide.



Green or renewable hydrogen can be produced through electrolyzers if the electrolyzers are powered by solar or wind energy. Several companies of this nature have emerged in the past few years. ITM Power in England and Proton Onsite in Norway are two of the largest companies in this industry. If not powered by solar panels or wind power, they require external electricity most likely created by coal, gas or oil. We believe that our process when fully developed may potentially offer a competitive advantage as we anticipate it will be completely green and renewable and utilize no external power other than the sun.
