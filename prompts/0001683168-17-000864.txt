ITEM 1 BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
Lifeway Foods, Inc. (the "Company", "Lifeway", “we”, or “our”) was co-founded in 1986 by Michael and Ludmila Smolyansky shortly after their emigration from Russia to the United States. Mr. and Mrs. Smolyansky were the first to successfully introduce kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale, initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. In the thirty years that have followed, Lifeway has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader market spaces of probiotic-based products and natural, "better for you" foods.
PRODUCTS
 
Lifeway's primary product is drinkable kefir, a fermented dairy product. Kefir has a tart and tangy taste similar to yogurt and the consistency of a smoothie. Kefir also has a slightly effervescent quality all its own. Unlike yogurt, Lifeway incorporates a unique blend of probiotic kefir cultures in the fermentation process. The probiotic feature, in concert with the base-line nutritional value of a staple beverage that is high in protein, calcium and vitamin D, and low in calories, presents a unique and differentiated taste profile.
 
We manufacture (or have manufactured) our products under our own brand, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. Our product categories are:
 

· | Drinkable kefir, sold in a variety of organic and non-organic sizes, flavors, and types, including low fat, non-fat, whole milk, protein, BioKefir (a 3.5 oz. kefir with additional probiotic cultures), and Kefir with Oats.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ProBugs, a line of kefir products in drinkable, frozen, and freeze dried formats, designed for children.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Frozen Kefir, available in both bars and pint-size containers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | European-style soft cheeses.
--+-----------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company offered over 50 varieties of its kefir products including more than 20 flavors. In late 2016, we announced that we would begin offering Kefir Cups, a strained, cupped version of our kefir; and Organic Farmer Cheese Cups, a cupped version of our soft cheeses, both served in resealable 5 oz. containers with mini-spoons. We have also announced that we will begin offering Lifeway Elixir, a line of sparkling organic probiotic beverages, and probiotic supplements for adults and children. Because these product line launches occurred in late 2016 or early 2017, they had no significant impact on 2016 financial performance.
 
Net sales of products by category were as follows for the years ended December 31:
 

 | 2016 | | 2015
-----------------------------------+------+---------+-----
In thousands | $ | | % | | $ | | % 
Drinkable Kefir other than ProBugs | $ | 105,983 | | 85.6% | | $ | 100,812 | 85.0%
Lifeway cheese products | | 10,258 | | 8.3% | | | 9,725 | 8.2% 
ProBugs Kefir products | | 6,383 | | 5.1% | | | 6,775 | 5.7%

Product innovation and new product development
 
The Company is committed to maintaining its position as the leading producer of kefir and routinely evaluates opportunities for new product flavors and formulations, improved package design, new product configurations and other innovation opportunities. Beyond our kefir products, the Company has an ongoing effort to extend the strength of the Lifeway brand and leverage the capabilities of the Lifeway organization into categories outside of the dairy aisle, including into non-food categories. As noted above, these product innovation and development efforts led to the launch of our cupped kefir and cupped cheese product line, a line of probiotic supplements, and a probiotic beverage line.
 
Lifeway considers research and development of new products to be a significant part of our overall business philosophy and leverages its existing staff to conduct its innovation, research, and development efforts, rather than a dedicated research and development staff. Accordingly, we did not incur significant research and development expenses in 2016.
 
PRODUCTION
 
Manufacturing
 
During 2016 and 2015, approximately 99% of our revenue was derived from products manufactured at our own facilities. We currently operate the following manufacturing and distribution facilities:
 

· | Morton Grove, Illinois, which produces drinkable kefir, our drinkable ProBugs kefir, and cheese products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Skokie, Illinois, which produces cheese products;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | Waukesha, Wisconsin, which produces drinkable kefir products and our drinkable ProBugs products, and which has the capacity to store and distribute products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Niles, Illinois, which stores and distributes all products, including those manufactured by co-packers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which produces drinkable kefir and cheese products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We own these manufacturing facilities, and all our fixed assets associated with manufacturing, storage, and distribution of our products are located in the United States.
 
Co-Packers
 
In addition to the products manufactured in our own facilities, independent manufacturers (“co-packers”) manufacture some of our products. We have co-packer agreements to manufacture drinkable kefir in European markets, our freeze-dried ProBugs kefir products, our frozen kefir products, our probiotic supplements, and our sparkling organic probiotic beverages. During 2016 and 2015, approximately 1% of our revenue was derived from products manufactured by independent co-packers. Our co-packers are audited regularly by our staff and are required to follow our specifications and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Additionally, the co-packers are required to ensure our products are manufactured in accordance with our quality and safety specifications and that they are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations.
 
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
 
Sales Organization
 We sell our products primarily through our direct sales force, brokers and distributors. Our sales organization strives to cultivate strong, collaborative relationships with our customers that facilitate favorable shelf placement for our products, which, we believe will drive sales volumes when combined with our marketing efforts and our brand strength. Our relationships with food brokers provide additional retail customer coverage as a supplement to our direct sales force. These brokers are paid commissions that vary based on the scope of services provided and customers served.

Distribution inside the United States
 
Lifeway's products reach the consumer through four primary "route-to-market" pathways:
 

• | Retail-direct;
--+---------------


• | Distributor;
--+-------------


• | Direct store delivery ("DSD");
--+-------------------------------


• | Retail sales.
--+--------------

 
Under the retail-direct channel, our products are sold to the retailer and shipped to that retailer's distribution center. In turn our retail customer then delivers the product to its respective stores within its chain. Customers in this route-to-market grouping include among others Kroger, Walmart and Costco. Under the retail direct model, optimal product merchandising, assortments and product presentation are attended to by the retailer with support from Lifeway's broker network. Sales to our retail-direct customers represents about 50% of total Company net sales.
 
Under the distributor channel, our products are sold to distributors and shipped to those distributors’ designated warehouses. In turn, our distributor customers then sell the product to their retail customers and ship the products to their retail customers. Our distributors often use a DSD model of their own to make deliveries directly to individual stores but also make deliveries to a retailer's warehouse. Our distributor customers include among others United Natural Foods, Kehe Foods and C&S Wholesale. Optimal product merchandising, assortments and product presentation at the retail end of the channel are attended to by the distributor with support from Lifeway's broker network. Sales to our distributor customers represents about 45% of total Company net sales.
 
Under the direct store delivery (DSD) route to market, we distribute our products directly to the grocer's dairy cooler using a fleet of Company-owned vehicles and a team of Lifeway merchandisers who engage face-to-face with store management to ensure optimal product assortments and presentation. We operate our DSD model in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area only. Sales to our DSD customers represents approximately 5% of total Company net sales.
 
In the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area, Lifeway operates three retail stores and a food truck under its Lifeway Kefir Shop subsidiary. The Company sells its frozen kefir products through these retail outlets. Sales through these retail outlets represents less than 1% of net sales.
 
Distribution outside of the U.S. 
 
Substantially all of Lifeway's products are distributed within the United States; however, certain of our distributors sell our products to retailers in Mexico, Costa Rica, Dubai, Hong Kong, China, portions of South America, and the Caribbean. Additionally, the Company's products reach consumers in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden under third party co-manufacturing agreements and in-country distributor arrangements. Sales outside the United States represents less than 1% of net sales.
 
Distribution arrangements
 
Our generally standardized agreements with independent distributors allow us the latitude to establish new relationships with independent distributors as the need arises. Lifeway does not offer exclusive territories to any of its distributors.
 
Independent distributors are provided Lifeway products at wholesale prices for distribution to their retail accounts. Lifeway believes that the price at which its products are sold to its distributors is competitive with the prices generally paid by distributors for similar products in the markets served. Due to the perishable nature of our products and the costs associated with moving product back through the channel, the Company does not offer return privileges to any of its distributors or channel customers; however, from time to time we do provide our customers with allowances for non-saleable product.

MARKETING
 
We use a combination of sales incentives, trade promotions, and consumer promotions to market our products.
 
Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances
 
The Company offers various sales incentives and trade promotional programs to its retailer and distributor customers from time to time in the normal course of business. These sales incentives and trade promotion programs typically include rebates, in-store display and demo allowances, allowances for non-saleable product, coupons and other trade promotional activities. Trade promotions support price features, displays, and other merchandising of our products by our retail and distributor customers. These arrangements are recorded as a reduction to net sales in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
Consumer Promotions and Marketing Campaigns
 
The Company engages in an ongoing and wide variety of marketing and media campaigns - primarily digital and social media, print advertising in some newspapers and magazines, and, to a lesser extent, targeted television advertising. These marketing and media efforts are complemented by participation in sponsorships of cultural and community events, various festivals, industry-related trade shows, and in-store promotional events. Our consumer marketing efforts also include cooperative advertising programs with our retail customers and various couponing campaigns, online consumer relationship programs, and other similar forms of promotions.
 
Our marketing efforts are aimed at stimulating demand with new and existing consumers by elevating awareness and consumption of kefir and probiotics, as well as enhancing our brand equity. Our awareness marketing seeks to promote the verifiable nutritional profile, purity, benefits, and good taste of our kefir.
 
COMPETITION
 
Lifeway competes with a limited number of other domestic kefir producers and consequently faces a small amount of direct competition for kefir products; however, Lifeway's kefir-based products compete with other dairy products, notably spoonable and drinkable yogurt, and, increasingly, with non-dairy probiotic products that incorporate kefir cultures but are not kefir. Many of our competitors are well-established and have significantly greater financial resources than Lifeway to promote their products.
SUPPLIERS
 
We purchase our ingredients such as raw milk, cane and other forms of sugar from unaffiliated suppliers. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas, fuels, and electricity for our facilities. Purchases are made through purchase orders or contracts, and price, delivery terms, and product specifications vary. Although the prices for our principal ingredients can fluctuate based on economic, weather, and other conditions, Lifeway believes it has ready access to multiple suppliers for all ingredient and packaging requirements.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, two distributors, United Natural Foods, Inc. and KEHE, represented approximately 15% and 8% of the Company's total net sales. These customers collectively accounted for approximately 25% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016.
SEGMENTS
 
The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment based on how the Company's chief operating decision maker manages the business and in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing Company performance, has been identified collectively as the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the board of directors. Substantially all of the consolidated revenues of the Company relate to the sale of fermented dairy products which are produced using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a network of distributors and retailers in the United States.

DANONE SA
 
Since October, 1999 Danone SA, through subsidiaries (collectively “Danone”), has been the beneficial owner of approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of Lifeway. Lifeway and Danone are parties to a Stockholders' Agreement dated October 1, 1999, which as amended provides Danone the right to nominate one director, provides Danone with anti-dilutive rights relating to certain future offerings and issuances of capital stock, and grants Danone limited registration rights.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 
We own more than thirty United States trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own other trademarks and service marks for which we have filed applications for U.S. registration. We have licenses to use certain trademarks inside and outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. The Company's policy is to pursue registration of its marks whenever appropriate and to vigorously oppose any infringements of its marks. The Company regards its Lifeway family of trademarks and other trademarks as having substantial value and as being an important factor in the marketing of its products. The loss of such identification would have a material adverse impact on our operations and share price.
 
Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. In addition, we own numerous copyrights, registered and unregistered, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other proprietary rights that are not registered.
 
REGULATION
 
Lifeway is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities. In the United States, agencies governing the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of our products include, among others, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the United States Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and their state and local equivalents. Under various statutes, these agencies prescribe, among other things, the requirements and standards for quality, safety, and representation of our products to consumers. We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to our organic products and production. For example, as required by the National Organic Program ("NOP"), we rely on third parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways.
 
Internationally, we are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products, including the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom; the Canadian Food Inspection Agency in Canada; the National Service of Health, Food Safety and Agro-Food Quality (known by its Spanish-language acronym “SENASICA”) and the Federal Commission for the Protection from Sanitary Risks (“COFEPRIS”) in Mexico; the Food Safety Authority in Ireland; and the European Food Safety Authority which supports the European Commission, as well as individual country, province, state, and local regulations.
 
MILK INDUSTRY REGULATION
 
Our primary raw material is conventional and organic raw milk. Raw milk primarily contains raw skim milk, in addition to a small percentage of butterfat and other components. The federal government establishes minimum prices for raw milk purchased in federally regulated areas. Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices. The federal government announces prices for raw milk each month. While we are subject to federal government regulations that establish minimum prices for milk, the prices we pay producers of organic raw milk are generally well above such minimum prices, as organic milk production is generally costlier, and organic milk therefore commands a price premium. In addition to the prices for raw milk, we also pay producer (“over-order”) premiums, federal order administration costs, and other related charges that vary by milk product, location, and supplier.

FOOD SAFETY
 
Lifeway takes appropriate precautions to ensure the safety of our products. In addition to routine inspections by state and federal regulatory agencies, including the USDA and FDA, we have instituted Company-wide quality systems that address topics such as supplier control; ingredient, packaging, and product specifications; preventive maintenance; pest control; and sanitation. Each of our facilities also has in place a hazard analysis critical control points (“HACCP”) plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards. To the extent that the federal Food Safety Modernization Act applies to Lifeway’s business, we develop food safety plans and implement preventive measures to protect against food contamination. We also maintain a product recall plan, including lot identifiability and traceability measures that allow us to act quickly to reduce the risk of consumption of any product that we suspect may pose a health issue.
 
We maintain general liability insurance, including product liability coverage, which we believe to be sufficient to cover potential product liabilities.
 
We have also implemented the Safe Quality Food (“SQF”) program at all of our facilities. SQF is a fully integrated food safety and quality management protocol designed specifically for the food sector. The SQF code, based on universally accepted CODEX Alimentarius, HACCP guidelines and the Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”) standards, offers a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality simultaneously. Safe Quality Food or SQF certification provides an independent and external validation that a product, process or service complies with international, regulatory and other specified standards. Our Waukesha facility is SQF level III certified, the highest level of such certification from GFSI.
 
SEASONALITY
 
The Company's business is not seasonal.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2016 the Company employed approximately 320 employees, approximately 125 of which were members of a union bargaining unit.
 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
 
The Company maintains a corporate website for investors at www.lifeway.net and it makes available, free of charge, through this website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports that the Company files with or furnishes to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.
