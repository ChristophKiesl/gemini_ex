Item 1. Business
Overview
Brown-Forman Corporation (the “Company,” “Brown-Forman,” “we,” “us,” or “our” below) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1933, successor to a business founded in 1870 as a partnership and later incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1901. We primarily manufacture, bottle, import, export, market, and sell a wide variety of alcoholic beverages under recognized brands. We employ over 4,700 people on six continents, including approximately 1,300 people in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, home of our world headquarters. We are the largest American-owned spirits and wine company with global reach. We are a “controlled company” under New York Stock Exchange rules as the Brown family owns more than 50% of our voting stock. Additionally, taking into account ownership of shares of our non-voting stock, the Brown family controls more than 50% of the economic ownership in Brown‑Forman.
For a discussion of recent developments, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Executive Summary.”
Brands
Beginning in 1870 with Old Forester Bourbon Whisky – our founding brand – and spanning the generations since, we have built a portfolio of more than 40 spirit, wine, and ready-to-drink cocktail (RTD) brands that includes some of the best-known and most-loved trademarks in our industry. The most important brand in our portfolio is Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, which is the fourth-largest spirits brand of any kind and the largest American whiskey brand in the world, according to Impact Databank’s “Top 100 Premium Spirits Brands Worldwide” list. Among the top five premium spirits brands on the list, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey was the only one to grow by volume in 2016. In its fourth year on the Worldwide Impact list, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey remains the second-largest-selling flavored whiskey. Our other leading global brands on the Worldwide Impact list are Finlandia, the tenth-largest-selling vodka; Canadian Mist, the fourth-largest-selling Canadian whisky; and el Jimador, which is the fourth-largest-selling tequila and designated as an Impact “Hot Brand.” Additionally, Woodford Reserve was once again selected as an Impact “Hot Brand.”1

Our vision in marketing is to “be the best brand builders in the industry.” We build our brands by investing in programs that we believe create enduring connections with our consumers. These programs cover a wide spectrum of activities, including media (TV, radio, print, outdoor, and, increasingly, digital and social media), consumer and trade promotions, sponsorships, and visitor center programs at our distilleries and our winery. We expect to grow our sales and profits by consistently delivering creative, responsible marketing programs that drive brand recognition, brand trial, brand loyalty, and, ultimately, consumer demand around the world.
Markets
We sell our products in more than 165 countries around the world. The United States, our largest, most important market, accounted for 48% of our net sales in fiscal 2017. Our largest international markets include the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, Germany, France, Poland, Japan, Canada, and Russia. Over the last decade, we have continued to expand our international footprint. In fiscal 2017, we generated 52% of our net sales outside the United States compared to 51% ten years ago. The U.S. proportion of net sales grew from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 then stayed constant in fiscal 2017, mainly due to the negative effect of foreign exchange on our international business. We present the percentage of total net sales by geographic area for our most recent three fiscal years and, to provide historical context, fiscal 2008, below:

Percentage of Total Net Sales by Geographic Area
------------------------------------------------
 | Year ended April 30
2008 | ... | 2015 | 2016 | 2017
United States | 49 | % | ... | 46 | % | 48 | % | 48 | %

For details about net sales in our largest markets, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2017 Market Highlights.” For details about our reportable segment and for additional geographic information about net sales and long-lived assets, refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” For details on risks related to our global operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Distribution Network and Customers
Our distribution network, which we sometimes refer to as our “route-to-consumer” (RTC), takes a variety of forms, depending on (a) a market’s laws and regulatory framework for trade in beverage alcohol, (b) our assessment of a market’s long-term attractiveness and competitive dynamics, (c) the relative profitability of distribution options available to us, (d) the structure of the retail and wholesale trade in a market, and (e) our portfolio’s development stage in a market. As these factors change, we evaluate our RTC strategy and, from time to time, adapt our model.
In the United States, which generally prohibits wine and spirits manufacturers from selling their products directly to consumers, we sell our brands either to distributors or (in states that directly control alcohol sales) to state governments that then sell to retail customers and consumers. 
Outside the United States, we use a variety of RTC models, which can be grouped into three categories: owned distribution, partner, and government controlled markets. We own and operate distribution companies in 13 markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mexico, Poland, Thailand, and Turkey. In these markets, and in a large portion of the travel retail channel, we sell our products directly to retailers, to wholesalers, or, in Canada, to provincial governments. Over the past decade, we began distribution operations in multiple markets outside the United States, as shown in the table below.

Recent Route-to-Consumer Changes
--------------------------------
Fiscal year | Market 
2011 | Germany
 | Brazil 
2012 | Turkey 
2014 | France 
2018 (planned) | Spain 

In the United Kingdom, we partner in a cost-sharing arrangement with another supplier, Bacardi Limited, to sell a portfolio of both companies’ brands. In many other markets, including Italy, Japan, Russia, and South Africa, we rely on others to distribute our brands, generally under fixed-term distribution contracts. 
We believe that our customer relationships are good. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.
Seasonality
Holiday buying makes the fourth calendar quarter (generally our third fiscal quarter) the peak season for our business. Approximately 32%, 31%, and 30% of our net sales for fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2017, respectively, were in the fourth calendar quarter. 
Competition
Trade information indicates that we are one of the largest global suppliers of premium spirits and wine. According to International Wine & Spirit Research (IWSR), for calendar year 2016, the ten largest global spirits companies controlled less than 20% of the total global market for spirits (on a volume basis). While we believe that the overall market environment offers considerable growth opportunities for us, our industry is now, and will remain, highly competitive. We compete against many global, regional, and local brands in a variety of categories of beverage alcohol, but our brands compete primarily in the industry’s premium-and-higher price categories. Our competitors include major global wine and spirits companies, such as Bacardi Limited, Beam Suntory Inc., Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A., Diageo PLC, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Pernod Ricard SA, and Rémy Cointreau. In addition, particularly in the United States, we increasingly compete with national companies and craft spirit brands, many of which are recent entrants to the industry.
Brand recognition, brand provenance, quality of product and packaging, availability, flavor profile, and price affect consumers’ choices among competing brands in our industry. Several factors influence consumers’ buying decisions, including: advertising; promotions; merchandising in bars, restaurants, and shops; expert or celebrity endorsement; social media and word of mouth; and the timing and relevance of new product introductions. Although some competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, we believe that our competitive position is strong, particularly as it relates to brand recognition, quality, availability, and relevance of new product introductions.
Ingredients and Other Supplies
The principal raw materials used in manufacturing and packaging our distilled spirits, liqueurs, RTD products, and wines are shown in the table below. 

Principal Raw Materials
-----------------------
Distilled Spirits | Liqueurs | RTD Products | Wines | Packaging 
Agave | Flavorings | Flavorings | Grapes | Aluminum cans
Barley | Neutral spirits | Malt | Wood | Cartons

Sugar | Wine | Water | | Labels 
Water | | Whiskey | | 
Wood | | | |

Our grape supply comes from a combination of our California vineyards and contracts with independent growers. We believe that our relationships with our growers are good. Currently, none of these raw materials are in short supply, but shortages could occur. From time to time, our agricultural ingredients (corn, rye, malted barley, agave, and grapes) could be adversely affected by weather and other forces that might constrain supply.
Whiskeys, certain tequilas, and other distilled spirits must be aged. Because we must schedule production years in advance to meet future demand for these products, our inventories of them may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.
For details on risks related to the availability of raw materials and the uncertainty inherent in forecasting supply and demand, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights include trademarks, copyrights, proprietary packaging and trade dress, proprietary manufacturing technologies, know-how, and patents. Our intellectual property, especially our trademarks, is essential to our business. We register our trademarks broadly – some of them in every country where registration is possible. We register others where we sell or expect to sell our products. We protect our intellectual property rights vigorously but fairly. We have licensed some of our trademarks to third parties for use with services or on products other than alcoholic beverages, which we believe enhances the awareness and protection of our brands.
For details on risks related to the protection of our intellectual property, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” For details on our most important brands, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Fiscal 2017 Brand Highlights.”
Regulatory Environment
Federal, state, local, and foreign authorities regulate the production, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of our products. Some countries and local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the marketing or sale of distilled spirits in whole or in part.
In the United States, at the federal level, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury regulates the wine and spirits industry with respect to the production, blending, bottling, labeling, sales, advertising, and transportation of beverage alcohol. Similar regulatory regimes exist at the state level and in most non-U.S. jurisdictions where we sell our products. In addition, beverage alcohol products are subject to customs duties or excise taxation in many countries, including taxation at the federal, state, and local level in the United States.
Laws of each nation define distilling and maturation requirements; for example, under U.S. federal regulations, bourbon and Tennessee whiskeys must be aged in new charred oak barrels; we typically age our whiskeys three to six years. Canadian whisky is required to be manufactured in Canada in compliance with Canadian laws. Mexican authorities regulate the production and bottling of tequilas; they mandate minimum aging periods for extra anejo (three years), anejo (one year), and reposado (two months) tequilas. Irish whiskey must be matured at least three years in a wood cask, such as oak, on the island of Ireland. Scotch whisky must be matured in oak casks for at least three years in Scotland. We comply with all of the above laws and regulations.
Our operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, and our policy is to comply with them.
Strategy
Seven years ago, we introduced our “Brown-Forman 150” long-term strategy, focused on driving sustainable growth toward our 150th anniversary in 2020. The B-F Arrow articulates our core principles: our purpose as well as the vision, values, and behaviors that we expect our employees to embrace and exhibit.
7

These core principles are a constant and powerful means of connecting our stakeholders to a shared vision of “Building Forever,” and we continue to refresh our strategies to reflect current realities. The strategic ambitions described below both demonstrate a sustained focus on several drivers of our recent growth and acknowledge today’s emerging opportunities.
We seek to build brands and businesses that can create shareholder value – ones that deliver strong and sustainable growth, solid margins, and high returns on investment. In addition, given our growing size and scale, we focus on building brands that can be meaningful for our company over time. Our first priority is to innovate and grow our premium spirits portfolio organically. But as opportunities arise, we will consider acquisitions and partnerships that meet our rigorous quantitative and qualitative criteria.
The Jack Daniel’s family of brands, including Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, is our most valuable asset. We will always work to keep Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey strong, healthy, and relevant to consumers worldwide, and to take advantage of the abundant opportunities to grow the Jack Daniel’s family of brands across markets, price points, channels, and consumer groups. Product innovation has become a meaningful contributor to our company’s performance in recent years. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to grow the Jack Daniel’s family of brands through thoughtful new product introductions, including the recently announced U.S. launch of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Rye in the fall of 2017, and the continued expansion of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire in markets outside of the United States. 
We are the global leader in American whiskey1, and we will continue to pursue growth in the broader global, premium whiskey category. We believe that we can leverage our whiskey-making knowledge, production assets, trademarks, and brand- building skills to accomplish this objective. We will focus first on the global growth of our most important whiskey, Jack Daniel’s. In addition, we expect to generate excellent growth with our other whiskey brands around the world, particularly Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, which have both experienced rapid growth in recent years. 
In 2016, we launched Coopers’ Craft, our first new bourbon trademark in more than 20 years, in select markets in the United States. We unveiled our first expression of our Slane Irish Whiskey brand in April 2017 in Travel Retail in Ireland, and we expect to introduce the brand in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia during the summer of 2017. We added three single malt Scotch whisky brands, GlenDronach, BenRiach, and Glenglassaugh, to our world-class whiskey portfolio in June 2016 with the acquisition of The BenRiach Distillery Company Limited. We believe that super- and ultra-premium whiskeys are attractive long-term businesses for us, and we will continue to pursue global growth in these categories.
Fiscal 2017 marks the ten year anniversary of our acquisition of Casa Herradura, and we are pleased with the development of both our business in Mexico and our portfolio of world-class tequila brands globally. Looking ahead, we plan to expand Herradura tequila in order to realize its full potential, reaching new consumers in Mexico, the United States, and other high-potential markets. After repositioning el Jimador tequila as a more premium brand at home in Mexico, we are encouraged by our prospects for long-term, profitable growth there. Outside Mexico, we have nearly quadrupled el Jimador’s volumes since fiscal 2008, and we remain confident in el Jimador’s potential to improve its position among the world’s leading tequila brands.
Finlandia is the tenth-largest-selling vodka in the world,2 and it is additionally prominent in several of the world’s largest vodka markets, such as Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and Czechia. We plan to grow Finlandia where its position is strong, including in its largest market, Poland, where Finlandia accounts for five out every ten bottles of imported vodka sold.1

In fiscal 2016, as part of our evolving portfolio strategy and our efforts to focus resources on our highest strategic priorities, we sold our Southern Comfort and Tuaca brands. This decision reflects our continuing efforts to reshape our portfolio by developing, divesting, and acquiring brands to create value and improve growth.
The United States remains our largest market, and continuing to grow in this market is important to our long-term success. We expect to foster this growth by emphasizing fast-growing spirits categories such as super-premium whiskeys and tequila, continued product and packaging innovation, continued route-to-consumer proficiency, and brand building within growing consumer segments (with increasing emphasis on multicultural marketing).
Over the last two decades, our business outside the United States has grown more quickly than our business within it. Although the past three years have been an exception to this trend, we expect the longer-term trend to resume. Our ability to achieve our long-term growth objectives requires further development of our business globally, especially in emerging markets. We expect to continue to grow our business in developed markets such as France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom. We will continue to pursue RTC strategies that will expand our access to and understanding of consumers in these diverse markets, such as the establishment of our own distribution organization in Spain this summer, which is the world’s ninth largest whiskey market. In addition, we expect increasingly significant contributions to our growth from emerging markets including Mexico, Poland, Turkey, Brazil, China, Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. 
We believe that having a long-term-focused, committed, engaged shareholder base, anchored by the Brown family, gives us an important strategic advantage, particularly in a business with aged products and multi-generational brands. For nearly 150 years, the Company and the Brown family have been committed to preserving Brown-Forman as a thriving, family controlled, independent company. 
Recognizing the strong cash-generating capacity and the capital efficiency of our business, we will continue to pursue what we believe to be well-balanced capital deployment strategies aimed at perpetuating Brown-Forman’s strength and independence.
Corporate Responsibility
In pursuing the objectives described above, we will strive to be responsible in everything we do. Our history of responsibility began in 1870, when our founder, George Garvin Brown, first sold medicinal whiskey in glass bottles to ensure quality and safety – an innovative idea back when whiskey was usually sold by the barrel. Today, achieving our stated business purpose, to “enrich the experience of life,” is possible only within a context of corporate responsibility. This means promoting responsible consumer enjoyment of our brands; working to reduce alcohol abuse and misuse; protecting the environment; providing a healthy, safe, and inclusive workplace; and contributing to the communities where we operate around the globe.
Alcohol Responsibility. Our business is based on the belief that beverage alcohol, consumed in moderation, can enrich the experience of life. However, we are well aware that when consumed irresponsibly, alcohol can have harmful effects on people and society. We appreciate the need for governments to regulate our industry appropriately and effectively, taking into account national circumstances and local cultures. We also appreciate that some people should not drink or choose not to drink, and we respect this choice. Acting in partnership with others, we want to be part of the solution to real, complex problems such as underage drinking, drunk driving, overconsumption, and alcoholism.
As a significant player in the global beverage alcohol industry, we foster collective action with our peers. Working with other producers, we are able to leverage our views on a scale that can create change. For example, we continue to work with 11 other industry leaders that signed the Beer, Wine and Spirits Producers’ Commitments to Reduce Harmful Drinking. In the fourth year of our five year plan, we tailored our work to address key concerns in individual markets with programs that leveraged the strengths of local- and country-level partnerships. We also innovated strategies to promote responsible drinking and develop approaches that can help build programs and interventions to reduce harmful drinking. Our collective progress on these commitments will be reported annually through 2018 and can be seen at www.producerscommitments.org.
Since 2009, we have hosted an open forum to share our points of view, post the research of outside experts, and encourage the opinions of others at www.OurThinkingAboutDrinking.com. In the United States, we support The Ad Council’s “Buzzed Driving is Drunk Driving” campaigns and safe ride services. In 2016, Gentleman Jack partnered with the largest U.S. designated driver service to provide free designated drivers in 24 cities nationwide. We also continued to collaborate with the Responsible Retailing Forum, which brings together diverse stakeholders seeking to reduce underage sales, among other initiatives. In our consumer relationships, we seek to communicate through responsible advertising content and placement, relying on our comprehensive internal marketing code and adhering to industry marketing and advertising guidelines. We also engage consumers where they are through innovative programs such as the Cascadia Challenge, a partnership with U.S. Major League Soccer to get fans to pledge to be designated drivers at games in the Pacific Northwest. 
9

As part of our commitment to responsible marketing, and to enable consumers to make more informed decisions, in February 2017 we launched a website, nutrition.brown-forman.com, providing nutritional information on our brands. Our individual brand websites will be linked to this content later this year. We also are founding members of, and contribute significant resources to, the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility (responsibility.org), an organization created by spirits producers to prevent drunk driving and underage drinking as well as promote responsible decision-making. While this is a U.S. organization, we participate actively in similar organizations in other markets, such as DrinkWise in Australia, BSI in Germany, The Portman Group in the United Kingdom, and FISAC in Mexico. Our team in Finland and the Association of Finnish Alcoholic Beverage Suppliers created a website in 2016 to help parents educate their teens on how to say no to alcohol. We also provide long-running support for alcohol education programs at the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky (two major universities in the state of our corporate headquarters). 
Environmental Sustainability. We view environmental sustainability as integral to our strategy to perpetuate Brown-Forman and Build Forever. Our environmental sustainability strategy aims to protect and conserve resources that we depend on. It also reinforces our business strategy through programs that reduce costs through efficiency, lessen risks to our operations, and improve effectiveness through innovation. We invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and efficient transportation to reduce our carbon footprint. Mindful of our overall impact, in fiscal 2014, we set ambitious environmental sustainability goals for fiscal 2023: (a) reducing our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, (b) sending zero waste to landfill, and (c) reducing our water use and wastewater discharges per unit of product by 30% (versus 2012 baseline year). These goals support our ambition to responsibly grow our brands and our company while protecting and enriching the natural environment. We have refreshed our strategy to now include a greater focus beyond our operational borders into our supply chain. We report on our progress toward these goals in our biennial Corporate Responsibility Reports, available on our corporate website. In 2016, Newsweek magazine named Brown-Forman the third “greenest” U.S. beverage company, and number 52 among the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the United States. Rankings were based on eight measures of corporate sustainability and environmental performance.
Diversity, Inclusion, and Human Rights. We believe that having a diverse and inclusive workforce is central to our success. As we work to increase our brands’ relevance and appeal to diverse consumer groups, we need a diversity of experiences and outlooks within our own workforce. We also want employees to feel comfortable in contributing their whole selves and different perspectives to their work. Over the past few years, we have made progress with diverse representation at the senior level. Three women and one African American serve on our Board of Directors. Four members of our 14-member Executive Leadership Team are women and two are minorities. In 2017, we once again earned a perfect score of 100% in the Corporate Equality Index by the Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights organization promoting equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans. This makes us one of the “Best Places to Work for LGBT equality”1 in the United States for the seventh consecutive year. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) have been the core of our diversity culture by supporting employees’ growth while enhancing their contributions. Our eight ERGs foster a diverse and inclusive environment that drives our high-commitment, high-performance organization and encourages our employees to bring their individuality to work. Our commitment to diversity extends to our partnerships with small and diverse suppliers. By 2020, our goal is to source at least 16% of our procurement from businesses owned by ethnic minorities, women, LGBT persons, people with disabilities, and veterans. To date, we have procured approximately 11% of our supplies from such businesses.
In the marketplace, we focus on promoting fair and ethical business practices. We remain committed to the guidelines set forth in our Global Human Rights Statement, defining our commitment to respecting the fundamental rights of all human beings. Our work in this area helped inform our response to the U.K.’s recent passage of the Modern Slavery Act in 2015, which is available on our corporate website.
Community Involvement. Our approach to philanthropy reflects our values as a corporate citizen. Our civic engagement supports non-profit organizations that improve the lives of individuals and the vitality of our communities. We believe, as a responsible and caring corporate citizen, it is vital that we give back to the communities that support both our employees and our business. Through our contributions, we work to create communities that ensure basic living standards, support healthy and sustainable living, and enhance intellectual and cultural living. While we focus on our hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, our civic engagement activities extend to the communities around the globe where our employees live, work, and raise their families.
In fiscal 2017, we donated approximately $11 million, logged approximately 15,000 volunteer hours, and had 128 employees serve on boards of directors of 211 non-profit organizations.
