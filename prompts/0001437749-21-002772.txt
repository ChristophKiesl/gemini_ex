Since then, we have grown through a series of acquisitions and now own a global portfolio of businesses.
 
We operate all of our businesses through Huntsman International, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Huntsman International is a Delaware limited liability company and was formed in 1999.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 10003 Woodloch Forest Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77380, and our telephone number at that location is (281) 719-6000.
  Recent Developments 
 
COVID-19 Update
 
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) has spread from China to many other countries, including the United States (“U.S.”). In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, there have not been any significant interruptions in our ability to provide our products and support to our customers. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions throughout the U.S. and the world, including the markets in which we operate. Demand for our products declined at a rapid pace in the second quarter 2020, which led to a meaningful adverse impact on our revenues and financial results. Although we have experienced improved conditions in most of our core markets in the second half of 2020, there continues to be many uncertainties regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the scope of scientific and health issues, the anticipated duration of the pandemic and the extent of local, regional and worldwide economic, social and political disruption. Given such uncertainties, it is difficult to estimate the magnitude COVID-19 may impact our future business, but we expect any adverse impact to continue for some time.
 
In response to the impact of COVID-19, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, cost saving initiatives, including:
 

● | suspended merit and general wage increases that customarily would have occurred at the end of the first quarter of 2020;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implemented a temporary hiring freeze for all non-business critical positions;

Sale of Assets at our Basel, Switzerland Site
 
In November 2020, we entered into a sale and leaseback agreement to sell certain properties in Basel, Switzerland for approximately CHF 67 million (approximately $73 million) and to lease those properties back for five years. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately CHF 30 million (approximately $33 million). 
 
Sale of India-Based Do-It-Yourself Consumer Adhesives Business
 
On November 3, 2020, we completed the sale of the India-based do-it-yourself consumer adhesives ("DIY") business, previously part of our Advanced Materials segment, to Pidilite Industries Ltd. and received cash of approximately $257 million. Under the terms of the agreement, we may receive up to approximately $28 million of additional cash under an earnout within 18 months if the business achieves certain sales revenue targets in line with the DIY business' 2019 performance. In connection with this sale, we recognized a pretax gain of $247 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was recorded in gain on sale of India-based DIY business in our consolidated statements of operations.
 
Sale of Venator Interest
 
On December 23, 2020, we completed the sale of approximately 42.4 million ordinary shares of Venator Materials PLC (“Venator”) to funds advised by SK Capital Partners, LP. We received approximately $99 million in cash, which included $8 million for a 30-month option described below. In addition to the cash proceeds received from the sale, we achieved immediate cash tax savings of approximately $150 million by offsetting the capital loss on the sale of Venator shares against the capital gain realized on the sale of our Chemical Intermediates Businesses. See “Note 4. Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions—Separation and Deconsolidation of Venator” to our consolidated financial statements.
 
Concurrently with the sale of Venator ordinary shares, we entered into an option agreement, pursuant to which we granted an option to funds advised by SK Capital Partners, LP to purchase the remaining approximate 9.7 million ordinary shares we hold in Venator at $2.15 per share. The option will expire on June 23, 2023 and will not be exercisable so long as such exercise would result in a default or an "Event of Default" under Venator’s Term Loan Credit Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 
In connection with the 2017 initial public offering of Venator, we recorded a receivable of approximately $34 million related to certain income tax benefits that was reduced upon completion of the sale of Venator shares to SK Capital Partners, LP due to a change of control limitation on specific Venator tax attributes. Accordingly, we wrote off approximately $31 million of this receivable upon completion of the sale of the Venator ordinary shares in December 2020.

Overview
 
We are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products. Our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations, which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers. Our products are used in a wide range of applications, including those in the adhesives, aerospace, automotive, construction products, durable and non-durable consumer products, electronics, insulation, medical, packaging, coatings and construction, power generation, refining, synthetic fiber, textile chemicals and dyes industries. We are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines, including MDI, amines, maleic anhydride, epoxy-based polymer formulations, textile chemicals and dyes. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $6,018 million, $6,797 million and $7,604 million, respectively.
 
We operate in four segments: Polyurethanes, Performance Products, Advanced Materials and Textile Effects. In August 2017, we separated our Titanium Dioxide and Performance Additives business (the “P&A Business”) through an initial public offering (“IPO”) of ordinary shares of Venator. In December 2020, we began to account for our remaining ownership of 9,688,761 Venator ordinary shares as an investment in equity securities that are marked to fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. For more information, see “Note 4. Discontinued Operations and Business Disposition—Separation and Deconsolidation of Venator” to our consolidated financial statements. On January 3, 2020, we completed the sale of our Chemical Intermediates Businesses to Indorama, and beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we reported the results of our Chemical Intermediates Businesses as discontinued operations. For more information, see “Note 4. Discontinued Operations and Business Dispositions—Sale of Chemical Intermediates Businesses” to our consolidated financial statements.
 
Our Products
 
All four of our segments produce differentiated organic chemical products. Growth in our differentiated products has been driven by the substitution of our products for other materials and by the level of global economic activity. Accordingly, the profitability of our differentiated products has been somewhat less influenced by the cyclicality that typically impacts the petrochemical industry.

Polyurethanes
 
General
 
We are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals, including MDI products, polyols and TPU (each discussed in more detail below under “—Products and Markets”). Polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams, as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. We focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth markets for specialty MDI and MDI-based polyurethane systems. Volume growth in our Polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by global economic activity and the continued substitution of MDI-based products for other materials across a broad range of applications. We operate three major polyurethane manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China. We also operate 30 strategically located downstream facilities, 26 of them are polyurethane formulation facilities, commonly referred to in the chemical industry as “systems houses,” located in close proximity to our customers worldwide, which enables us to focus on customer support, technical service and a differentiated product offering. We also operate two specialty polyester polyol manufacturing facilities focused on the insulation market and three downstream TPU manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and China.
 
Our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate, such as MDI, with polyols, which are derived largely from PO and EO. We are able to produce over 2,500 distinct MDI-based polyurethane products by modifying the MDI molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our MDI formulations. As a result, polyurethane products, especially those derived from MDI, are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end-use markets, including insulation in construction and appliances, cushioning for automotive and furniture, coatings, adhesives, wood binders for construction and furniture, footwear and other specialized engineering applications.
 
We operate a world-scale integrated polyurethane formulations facility and a world-scale research and development campus in China to service our customers in the critical Chinese market, the largest MDI market in the world, and we will support the long-term demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with Sinopec to form a joint venture to build and operate a world-scale PO/MTBE plant in Nanjing, China utilizing proprietary PO/MTBE manufacturing technology. We own a 49% interest in the joint venture and account for our interest in the joint venture as an equity method investment.
 
In May 2020, we rebranded our leading spray polyurethane foam (“SPF”) business as Huntsman Building Solutions (“HBS”). HBS was formed through our acquisitions of Icynene-Lapolla in 2020 and Demilec in 2018. Our SPF products offer significant environmental benefits, as our proprietary manufacturing process transforms low quality PET plastic bottles into highly effective energy-saving polyurethane insulation. HBS offers attractive growth potential as the business turns our lower margin polymeric MDI, the other key ingredient in SPF formulations, into higher margin specialized SPF products.
 
Products and Markets
 
MDI is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized, higher-value flexible foam as well as coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers. Polyols, including polyether and polyester polyols, are used in conjunction with MDI in rigid foam, flexible foam and other non-foam applications. The following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals. We produce MDI, polyols and TPU products and do not produce TDI products.
 

    5 

  

Polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products. Depending on their needs, customers will use either component polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements. By varying the blend, additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals, manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products.
 
Our strategy is focused on growing our differentiated product offering (specialty MDI and polyols, formulated MDI systems and TPU), which requires a greater emphasis on formulating capability to help our downstream customers to meet the desired effect required in their applications. These differentiated products tend to require technical solutions, offer higher margins, lower volatility and are less dependent on industry utilization rates compared to sales of component MDI or component polyols.
 
MDI. MDI has grown substantially over the past three decades, increasing by a factor of 6% CAGR, well in excess of global GDP. MDI has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than other polyurethane isocyanates. This is primarily because MDI can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications. We believe that MDI and formulated MDI systems, which combine MDI and polyols, will continue to grow at approximately double the rate of global GDP driven by the mega trends of energy management, food preservation, demographics and urbanization/transportation. MDI offers key products benefits of energy efficiency, comfort and durability aligned with these megatrends. We believe that MDI and formulated MDI systems will continue to substitute for alternative materials such as fiberglass in insulation, phenol formaldehyde in wood binders and TDI in automotive and furniture. Specialty cushioning and insulation applications, thermoplastic polyurethanes and adhesives and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of MDI. MDI experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting its exposure to seasonal construction-related end markets such as insulation and composite wood products. Sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year.
TPU. TPU is a high-quality, fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of MDI or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability, flexibility, strength, abrasion-resistance, shock absorbency and chemical resistance. We can tailor the performance characteristics of TPU to help meet the specific requirements of our customers. TPU is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries. It is also extruded into films for apparel, wires and cables for industrial use and in a wide variety of applications in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets.
Polyols. Polyols are combined with MDI and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of formulated polyurethane systems. Demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which MDI consumption has grown.
Aniline. Aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture MDI. The majority of our aniline is consumed internally with some sold to third parties. We believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive, MDI manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long-term, cost-competitive aniline supply contract.
 
Our strategic focus is on growing our differentiated (specialty MDI and polyols, formulated MDI-based systems and TPU) product offerings and the diagram below provides an overview of that focus with an approximation of the number of grades, formulations, products and stock keeping units which we produce and sell.

Sales and Marketing
 
We market our polyurethane chemicals to over 7,000 customers in more than 90 countries. Our sales, marketing and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets and key end-use markets, some of which require a coordinated global approach, such as key accounts across the automotive sector. These key end-use markets include the commercial and residential insulation, appliance, automotive, footwear, furniture and coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers industries. We sell both directly and indirectly to customers, the latter via a network of distributors and agents who in turn sell our products to customers who cannot be served as cost effectively by our internal sales groups.
 
We provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components (i.e., the isocyanate or the polyol) or in the form of “systems” in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers. Our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support, which can be tailored for the needs of our customers, is critical to our long-term success. We have strategically located our downstream polyurethane systems houses close to our customers, enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service. We believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers.
 
Our strategy is to grow the number and capability of our downstream facilities both organically and inorganically. As a result, we have made a number of “bolt-on” acquisitions in recent years to expand our downstream footprint and align with our strategic intent.
 
We believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts, in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships, have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long-term customer supply positions. Our sales strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions, quality products, reliable supply, competitive prices and superior customer service.
 
Manufacturing and Operations
 
Our world-scale MDI production facilities are located in Geismar, Louisiana; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and through our joint ventures in Caojing, China. These facilities receive aniline, which is a primary material used in the production of MDI, from our facilities located in Geismar, Louisiana; Wilton, U.K.; and Caojing, China. We believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities is necessary to provide cost competitiveness in MDI production. The following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at select polyurethanes facilities: 

 | MDI | | | Polyols | | TPU | Aniline | Nitrobenzene |

(1)    Represents our share of capacity from SLIC.
 (2)    Represents our approximately 78% share of capacity under our consolidated Rubicon LLC manufacturing joint venture with Lanxess AG.
 
At our Geismar, Rotterdam and Caojing facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce MDI. This technology contributes to our position as a low-cost MDI producer.
 
Joint Ventures
 
Rubicon Joint Venture. Lanxess AG (“Lanxess”) is our joint venture partner in Rubicon LLC, which owns aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA manufacturing facilities in Geismar, Louisiana. We are entitled to approximately 78% of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of Rubicon LLC, and Lanxess is entitled to 100% of the DPA production. In addition to operating the joint venture’s aniline, nitrobenzene and DPA facilities, Rubicon LLC operates our wholly-owned MDI, polyol and maleic anhydride facilities at Geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire Geismar complex. As a result of this joint venture, we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain. Rubicon LLC is consolidated in our financial statements.
Chinese MDI Joint Ventures. We are involved in two related joint ventures which operate MDI production facilities in Caojing, China. SLIC, our manufacturing joint venture with BASF and three Chinese chemical companies, produces MNB, aniline and crude MDI. We effectively own 35% of SLIC and account for our investment under the equity method. HPS, our splitting joint venture with Shanghai Chlor-Alkali Chemical Company, Ltd, manufactures pure MDI, polymeric MDI, MDI variants and formulated MDI systems. We own 70% of HPS and it is consolidated in our financial statements. These projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds. We completed capacity expansions of these facilities in the first quarter of 2018. The total production capacity of the SLIC facilities is 1,280 million pounds per year of MDI, of which HPS is entitled to 825 million pounds.
Chinese PO/MTBE Joint Venture. In November 2012, we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with Sinopec. The joint venture involved the construction and operation of a PO/MTBE facility in China. Under the joint venture agreement, we hold a 49% interest in the joint venture and Sinopec holds a 51% interest. Beneficial commercial operations began during the second half of 2017.

Raw Materials
 
The primary raw materials for MDI-based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and PO. Benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of MDI and aniline. Historically, benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs. We purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline, almost all of which we then use to produce MDI.
 
In connection with the sale of the Chemical Intermediates Businesses to Indorama, we entered into a strategic agreement for the supply of PO in North America. In China, the Chinese PO/MTBE joint venture supplies PO into our downstream China business. The strategic supply of PO gives us access to competitively priced PO and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of MDI products.
 
Competition
 
Our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include BASF, Covestro, Dow and Wanhua Chemical Group. While these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals, we focus on MDI and MDI-based formulated polyurethane systems. Our downstream business is fragmented with different competitors in various markets and regions. Our competitors in downstream markets include Kingspan, Carlisle and Coim. Our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways: (1) where price is the dominant element of competition, our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support, including cooperation on technical and safety matters; and (2) elsewhere, we compete on the basis of product performance, our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs.
Performance Products
 
General
 
Our Performance Products segment has leading global positions in the manufacture and sale of amines and maleic anhydride and serves a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets. Our Performance Products segment is organized by region and product family: amines and maleic anhydride (including licensing).
 
We produce a wide range of amines, many of which are sold into specialty markets such as epoxy curing agents, oil exploration and production, agrochemicals, and fuel and lubricant additives. We believe we are the largest global producer of polyetheramines, one of the largest producers of 2-(2-amino ethoxy) ethanol, sold under our DGA™ brand, the largest global producer making the full range of ethyleneamines, the second largest producer of morpholine and a leading global producer of low emission polyurethane catalysts.

Products and Markets
 
Amines. Amines are a family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia, or an alkylamine, with various ethylene and propylene derivatives. Generally, amines are valued for their properties as a reactive agent, emulsifier, dispersant, solvent or corrosion inhibitor. Growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with GDP growth. However, certain segments of the amines market, such as polyetheramines, have historically grown at rates in excess of GDP growth due to new product development, technical innovation and end-use substitution. As amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer-specific end-use applications, pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials. Our amines business is organized around the following product groups:

Product Group | Applications 
--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polyetheramines | Epoxy composites, polyurethane foams and insulation, construction and flooring, paints and coatings, lubricant and fuel additives, adhesives, agrochemicals, oilfield chemicals, printing inks and pigment dispersion
Ethyleneamines | Chemical building block used in lubricant and fuel additives, epoxy hardeners, wet strength resins, chelating agents and fungicides 
Specialty amines, including DGA™ Agent and JEFFCAT® catalysts | Gas treating, agricultural chemicals, personal care, lubricant and fuel additives, polyurethane foams, fabric softeners, paints and coatings, refinery processing and water treating 

 
Polyetheramines are produced by reacting polyol with ammonia. They provide sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations, enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials.
 
Our ethyleneamines are manufactured by reacting EDC and caustic soda with ammonia to produce a range of various ethyleneamines homologues having different molecular weights. Most other producers utilize a reductive amination process, which yields a light slate of ethyleneamines. We believe our heavier slate of homologues allows access to a greater range of markets.
 
Our amines are used in a wide variety of mainly industrial applications, including composites, paints and coatings, polyurethane foam, fuel and lubricant additives, and solvents. Our key amines customers include Afton, Bayer, Chevron Oronite, DuPont, Evonik, Hexion, Infineum, Ingevity, Lubrizol, Olin, PPG, Sherwin-Williams and Quadra.
 
Maleic Anhydride (including licensing). Maleic anhydride is a highly versatile chemical intermediate that is used to produce UPRs, which are the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products. Maleic anhydride is also used in the production of lubricants, food additives and artificial sweeteners.
 

Product Group | Applications 
------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maleic anhydride | Boat hulls, automotive, construction, lubricant and fuel additives, countertops, agrochemicals, paper and food additives
Maleic anhydride and other technology licensing | Maleic anhydride and 1-4 butanediol (BDO) and other process technologies 

 
Maleic anhydride is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst. Our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed butane-based process with a solvent recovery and refining system. We believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery. The maleic anhydride-based route to BDO manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes, which utilize PO, butadiene or acetylene as feedstocks. As a result, the growth in demand for BDO supports growing demand for our maleic anhydride technology. Generally, changes in price have resulted from a combination of changes in industry capacity utilization and underlying raw material costs.
 
We license our maleic anhydride technology and other technologies worldwide. Revenue from licensing comes from new plant commissioning, as well as current plant retrofits. Our licensing group also licenses technology on behalf of other Performance Products businesses and other segments.
 
Our key maleic anhydride customers include Andercol, Chevron Oronite, Cranston, Dixie, Ingevity, Lubrizol, MFG Chemical, Polynt-Reichhold and Tate & Lyle.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell approximately 350 products to over 900 customers globally through our Performance Products regional sales and marketing organizations, which have extensive market knowledge, considerable chemical industry experience and well-established customer relationships.
 
In more specialty products for certain markets (e.g., lubricants, coatings, construction, agrochemicals, oilfield, automotive, gas treating and insulation), our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications. We believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers.
 
We provide extensive pre- and post-sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements. These technical service professionals interact closely with our marketing managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies. In addition to our focused direct sales efforts, we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products. These distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end-use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces.

Our sales and technical services representatives work directly with our existing customers forming strong relationships and uncovering new opportunities. Demand for our products is subject to fabric trends and seasonal changes in connection with summer and winter fashion trends. Traditionally, sales generally peak in the second quarter of the year as textile mills prepare for the winter fashion trends which tend to use darker shades and heavier fabric, thereby using more of our products. However, in 2020, the seasonal tread was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic when many countries around the world restricted people movement in the second quarter, resulting in the lowest sales quarter of the year.
 
In determining the markets on which we focus, we look at growth opportunity and value proposition. Consumption markets are primarily in developed economies, such as Europe and North America, while production markets are primarily in Asia, particularly China, India, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Our downstream marketing team engages with leading brands and retailers in developed economies while our sales force and manufacturing footprint are primarily in Asia, closer to the manufacturing and sourcing base for textiles. We believe that this set-up also enables us to take advantage of continuous demand growth due to demographic and lifestyle changes in emerging markets.
 
For our textile effects products, we focus on providing effect competence and process competence to our customers. Effect competence, which we define as delivering value-added effects to our customers’ products, enables us to capitalize on new and innovative technologies and to assist our customers in their efforts to differentiate themselves from competitors. Process competence, which we define as applying know-how and expertise to improve customers’ processes, allows us to utilize our technical service to reduce cost, enhance efficiency and offer recommendations to improve the ecological and environmental footprint in the wet processing of textiles.

Health and Safety: Our global health and safety programs are designed around dedicated environmental, health and safety ("EHS") Standards and Procedures specifically tailored at the facility level to address the different jurisdictions and regulations, specific operating hazards and unique working environments. The Company’s objectives focus on regulatory compliance and protection of people and the environment. Compliance with the EHS Standards and Procedures are evaluated through site self-audits as well as regularly scheduled Corporate EHS audits. In addition, other management systems applicable to many of our sites include third party verification of Responsible Care® and ISO 14001. A key metric used to assess the safety performance of our operations is the OSHA Total Recordable Injury Rate (“TRIR”), which is based upon the number of recordable injuries per 100 employees. In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a TRIR of 0.28 and 0.49, respectively.
Ethics and Compliance: At Huntsman our commitment to our values of Honesty, Integrity, Respect and Responsibility unite us globally and fosters high ethical standards in our relationships with each other, with our customers and with all those we do business with. Our Business Conduct Guidelines, along with the policies and procedures referenced within the guidelines, provide guidance for all employees on topics such as anti-corruption and bribery, anti-trust and competition law, discrimination including our policy on harassment and retaliation, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information and reporting concerns and violations. The guidelines are used to reinforce our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and to emphasize the importance of having an open and welcoming environment in which all employees feel empowered to do what is right. Should potential violations of the guidelines, policies, procedures or the law occur, employees are encouraged to voice concerns promptly and are reminded that we do not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports a potential violation in good faith. All employees are required to complete the training on the Business Conduct Guidelines annually, and our Chief Compliance Officer reports matters related to the Business Conduct Guidelines to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. 
Compensation and Benefits: Our policy is to competitively compensate our associates and to appropriately motivate associates to provide value to our shareholders. Our compensation philosophy is to align both short-term and long-term incentives with our strategic objectives and to take into account market forces, best practices, and the performance of our Company and the employee. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace. Examples of benefits offered in the U.S. include a 401(k) plan with employer contributions; health benefits; business travel and life/disability insurance; supplemental voluntary insurance; and paid time off.
Training and Talent Development: We are committed to the continued development of our workforce. We provide technical and leadership training to our associates, customers and suppliers who work for or with our products and services. Training is provided in a number of formats to accommodate the learner’s style, pace, location, technological knowledge and access.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
 
General
 
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to occupational health and safety, process safety, pollution, protection of the environment and natural resources, product management and distribution, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal, modification and, in certain circumstances, revocation. Actual or alleged violations of safety laws, environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations or product distribution, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, or injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations altogether. In addition, some environmental laws may impose liability on a strict, joint and several basis. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations and make significant environmental compliance expenditures. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Information related to EHS matters may also be found in other areas of this report including “—Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Environmental Expenditures” to our consolidated financial statements and “Note 22. Environmental Health and Safety Matters” to our consolidated financial statements.

Environmental, Health and Safety Systems
 
We are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable EHS legal requirements, and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of EHS legal requirements applicable to our operations, enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements, improve the safety of our employees, contractors, community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants. We cannot guarantee, however, that these policies and systems will always be effective or that we will be able to manage EHS legal requirements without incurring substantial costs. Although EHS legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with, these EHS management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and reducing overall risk to us. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our capital expenditures for EHS matters totaled $28 million, $42 million and $32 million, respectively, and our estimated capital expenditures for 2021 is expected to be $47 million.
Environmental Remediation
 
We have incurred, and we may in the future incur, liabilities to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials. Similarly, we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses. Under some circumstances, the scope of our liabilities may extend to damages to natural resources.
 
In cases where our potential liabilities arise from historical contamination based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility, we frequently obtain an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre-closing conditions. We have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and, where applicable, mitigated our ultimate remediation liabilities. We cannot assure you, however, that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters.
 
Based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available, we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material effect on our financial statements. However, if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs, then such expenditures may have a material effect on our financial statements. At the current time, we are unable to estimate the total cost, exclusive of indemnification benefits, to remediate contaminated sites.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Climate Change
 
Globally, our operations are increasingly subject to regulations that seek to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and methane, which may be contributing to changes in the earth’s climate. At the Durban negotiations of the Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in 2012, a limited group of nations, including the European Union (the “EU”), agreed to a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that provides for reductions in GHG emissions. More significantly, the EU GHG Emissions Trading System (“ETS”), established pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol to reduce GHG emissions in the EU, continues in its fourth phase. The EU parliament has used a process to formalize “backloading”—the withholding of GHG allowances during the trading period from 2014 to 2016 with additional allowances auctioned during 2019 to 2020—to prop up carbon prices. As backloading is only a temporary measure, a sustainable solution to the imbalance between supply and demand requires structural changes to the ETS. To that end, the European Commission established a market stability reserve to address the current surplus of allowances and improve the system’s resilience that started operating in 2019. In addition, the EU has set a binding target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by at least 40% below the 1990 level by 2030 and a binding target to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 32% of the EU’s energy consumption by 2030. The European Commission proposed to increase the greenhouse gas emission reduction target to at least 55% in September 2020, and expects to complete the associated legislative proposals by June 2021.
 
In addition, at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, the U.S. and nearly 200 other nations entered into an international climate agreement, which went into effect in November 2016 (the “Paris Agreement”). Although the agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and the U.S. completed the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. In response to the U.S.’s withdrawal announcement, various corporations, investors, and U.S. state and local governments publicly pledged to further the goals of the Paris Agreement. On January 20, 2021, President Biden issued written notification to the United Nations of the U.S.’s intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which will become effective in 30 days.
 
Domestic efforts to curb GHG emissions are being led by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (the “EPA”) GHG regulations and similar programs of certain states. To the extent that our domestic operations are subject to the EPA’s GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the Clean Air Act’s (the “CAA”) requirements for pollutants regulated under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs. Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs.
 
We are already managing and reporting GHG emissions, to varying degrees, as required by law for our sites in locations subject to U.S. federal and state requirements, Kyoto Protocol obligations and/or ETS requirements. Although these sites are subject to existing GHG legislation, few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs, although it is possible that GHG emission restrictions may increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet GHG emission restrictions and/or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites.
 
Finally, it should be noted that most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
