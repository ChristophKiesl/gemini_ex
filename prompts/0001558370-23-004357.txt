Item 1. BUSINESS
The Merger
​
On September 15, 2022, STORE Capital Corporation, a Maryland corporation, Ivory Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”) and Ivory REIT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub” and, together with Parent, the “Parent Parties”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). The Parent Parties are affiliates of GIC, a global institutional investor, and Oak Street Real Estate Capital, a division of Blue Owl Capital, Inc. On February 3, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, STORE Capital Corporation merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”) with Merger Sub surviving (the “Surviving Entity”) and the separate existence of STORE Capital Corporation ceased. Immediately following the completion of the Merger, the Surviving Entity changed its name to STORE Capital LLC. References herein to “we”, the “Company” “S|T|O|R|E” or “STORE Capital” are references to STORE Capital Corporation prior to the Merger and to STORE Capital LLC upon and following the Merger. As of the Closing Date of the Merger, the common equity of the Company is no longer publicly traded. 
Overview
General. S|T|O|R|E is an internally managed net-lease real estate investment trust, or REIT, that is a leader in the acquisition, investment and management of Single Tenant Operational Real Estate, or STORE Properties, which is our target market and the inspiration for our name. A STORE Property is a real property location at which a company operates its business and generates sales and profits, which makes the location a profit center and, therefore, fundamentally important to that business. Our portfolio is highly diversified and our customers operate across a wide variety of industries within the service, service-oriented retail and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy.
Taxation as a Real Estate Investment Trust. STORE Capital Corporation elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commencing with its initial taxable year ended December 31, 2011. STORE Capital LLC has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its initial taxable year ended December 31, 2022. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our members annually. 
The Net-Lease Model and Sustainability. S|T|O|R|E is a net-lease REIT. Accordingly, we acquire STORE Properties from business owners, and then lease the properties back to the business owners under net-leases, substantially all of which are triple-net. Under a triple-net lease, our customer (the tenant) is solely responsible for operating the business conducted at the property subject to the lease, keeping the property and improvements in good order and repair, remodeling and updating the building as it deems appropriate to maximize business value, and paying the insurance, property taxes and other property-related expenses. Under the triple-net lease model, therefore, S|T|O|R|E is not a real estate operator; rather, we provide real estate financing solutions to customers seeking a long-term, more efficient cost alternative to real estate ownership. Following our acquisition of a property, it is our customer, and not S|T|O|R|E, that controls the property, including with respect to decisions as to when and how to implement environmentally sustainable practices at a given property.

Our Corporate Responsibility. We define success by our ability to make a positive difference for all of our stakeholders. S|T|O|R|E’s beginning was inspired by our belief that we could make a positive difference for real estate intensive businesses across the U.S. by delivering innovative and superior real estate capital solutions. That belief has guided our efforts to bring much needed capital and liquidity opportunities to middle-market and larger businesses which, in turn, have brought value creation and growth to our customers, owners and employees. For our many customers, S|T|O|R|E’s real estate lease solutions have contributed to their prospects for wealth creation and to their ability to grow, create jobs and contribute to many communities across the country. In turn, meeting the needs of our customers provides an extraordinary investment opportunity that we believe creates sustainable long-term wealth. We are committed to operating our business responsibly, guarding our valuable reputation and creating long-term and sustainable value for our company through a robust business model and attentiveness to our many stakeholders. S|T|O|R|E is committed to playing an important role for middle-market and larger companies across the U.S. in order to help them succeed, while making a positive impact on our collective communities, both today and for future generations.
Our Target Market and Asset Class
We provide real estate financing solutions principally to middle-market and larger businesses that own single tenant profit-center real estate locations on which they conduct their businesses and generate revenues and profits, which we refer to as Single Tenant Operational Real Estate or “STORE Properties.” Our customers operate these STORE Properties within the broad-based service, service-oriented retail and manufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy. We have designed our net-lease solutions to provide a long-term, cost efficient way to improve our customers’ capital structures and, thus, be a preferred alternative to real estate ownership.





Our customers typically have the choice either to own or to lease the real estate they use in their daily businesses. They choose to lease for various reasons, including the potential to lower their cost of capital, as leasing supplants traditional financing options that tie up the equity in their real estate. Leasing is also viewed as an attractive alternative to our customers because it generally locks in scheduled payments, at lower levels and for longer periods, than traditional financing options; these factors are viewed favorably relative to the amounts funded.
Because STORE Properties are profit-center locations, payment of rent under our lease contracts is supported not only by the credit quality of the tenant and the residual value of the real estate, but also and primarily by the profits produced by the business operations at the locations we own (e.g. unit-level profitability).
Creating Superior Lease Contracts
We believe that our net-lease contracts, and not simply tenant or real estate quality, are central to our potential to deliver superior long-term risk-adjusted rates of return. Contract quality embodies tenant and real estate characteristics, together with other investment attributes we believe are highly material. Contract attributes include the prices we pay for the real estate we own, inclusive of the prices relative to new construction cost. Other important contract attributes include the ability to receive unit-level financial statements, which allows us to evaluate unit-level cash flows relative to the rents we receive. Likewise, over many years of providing real estate net-lease capital, we have determined that tenant alignments of interest are highly important. Such alignments of interest can include full parent company recourse, credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, cross default provisions and the use of master leases. Master leases, which comprise most of our multi-property net-lease contracts, are individual lease contracts that bind multiple properties and offer landlords greater security in the event of tenant insolvency and bankruptcy. Whereas individual property leases provide tenants with the opportunity to evaluate the desirability and viability of each individual property they rent in the event of a bankruptcy, master leases bind multiple properties, permitting landlords to benefit from aggregate property performance and limiting tenants’ ability to pick and choose which leases to retain. Other important tenant contract considerations include contractual lease escalations, indemnification provisions, lease renewal rights, and the ability to sublease and assign leases, as well as qualitative considerations, such as alternative real estate use assessment and the composition of a tenant’s capitalization structure.

Our Business Process
We operate a platform for the acquisition of, investment in and management of STORE Properties that creates value through four core competencies. 

● | Investment Origination. A S|T|O|R|E hallmark is our ability to directly market our real estate lease solutions to middle-market and larger companies nation-wide, utilizing a team of experienced relationship managers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investment Underwriting. Our investment underwriting approach centers on evaluations of unit-level and corporate-level financial performance, together with detailed real estate valuation assessments, which is reflective of the characteristics of the STORE Property asset class.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Investment Documentation. The purchase documentation process includes the validation of investment underwriting through our due diligence process, which includes our initiation and receipt of third-party real estate valuations, title insurance, property condition assessments and environmental reports. When we are satisfied with the results and outcome of our pre-acquisition due diligence process, we purchase the property under a purchase agreement and enter into a lease with the seller.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Portfolio Management. Net-lease real estate investment portfolios require active management to realize superior risk-adjusted rates of return. S|T|O|R|E monitors unit-level profit and loss statements, customer corporate financial statements and the timely payment of property taxes and insurance in order to gauge portfolio quality.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Stewardship
We are committed to environmental sustainability and the mitigation of environmental risks in connection with the development of our property portfolio. This commitment reflects the fact that the properties we acquire are subject to both state and federal environmental regulations, but, more importantly, it aligns with our belief that being conscious of, and seeking to address and manage, environmental risks within our control, and supporting our customers to do the same in their businesses, plays a role in building and sustaining successful enterprises; and, thus, is material to the success of our own business.
Our environmental initiatives and partnerships focus on energy savings and carbon footprint reduction in our customers’ facilities. As we are a triple-net lease REIT, without direct control of physical locations, our primary strategy includes educating ourselves and our customers on evolving environmental strategies, soliciting feedback, and gathering environmental data from our customers. This includes developing relationships between our customers and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) vendor partners, and supporting our tenants in the implementation of green programs including energy efficiency and carbon reduction programs.


Human Capital Management
We believe that to continue delivering strong financial results, we must execute on a human capital strategy that prioritizes, among other things: (i) establishing a work environment that: attracts, develops, and retains top talent; (ii) affording our employees an engaging work experience that allows for career development and opportunities for meaningful civic involvement; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits, and rewarding outstanding performance; (iv) engaging with, and obtaining feedback from, our employees on their workplace experiences; (v) enabling every employee at every level to be treated with dignity and respect, to be free from discrimination and harassment, and to devote their full attention and best efforts to performing their job to the best of their respective abilities; and (vi) communicating with our board of directors on key topics. 
As part of our efforts to achieve these priorities:



● | We seek to foster a diverse and vibrant workplace of individuals who possess a broad range of experiences, backgrounds and skills, starting at the top.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | We empower our employees through employee-run engagement committees that develop and influence new employee onboarding, personal growth and professional development programs, company social and team-building events and health and wellness programs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We actively support charitable organizations that promote education and social well-being and we encourage our employees to personally volunteer with organizations that are meaningful to them.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We seek to identify future leaders and equip them with the tools for management roles within our Company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2022, we had 116 full-time employees, all of whom are located in our single office in Scottsdale, Arizona. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Competition
We face competition in the acquisition and financing of STORE Properties from numerous investors, including, but not limited to, traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity investors and other institutional investment funds, as well as private wealth management advisory firms that serve high net worth investors (also known as family offices).

Regulations and Requirements
Our properties are subject to various laws and regulations, including regulations relating to fire and safety requirements, as well as affirmative and negative contractual covenants and, in some instances, common area obligations. We believe that each of our customers has the necessary permits and approvals to operate and conduct their businesses on our properties. Moreover, our properties are subject to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws and regulations (collectively, the “ADA”). Our customers have primary responsibility for complying with these regulations and other requirements pursuant to our lease and loan agreements; however, we may have liability in certain circumstances if our tenants do not comply with such laws and regulations. As of January 31, 2023, we are not aware of any ADA non-compliance that we believe would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
Additionally, our properties are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may give rise to liabilities related to the presence, handling or discharge of hazardous materials that may emanate from properties that we purchase, regardless of fault. We mitigate the possible liabilities from such laws and regulations by undertaking extensive environmental due diligence and by entering into leases with the sellers of our properties, pursuant to which the sellers agree to certain covenants and indemnities that typically require the sellers to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and remediate or take other corrective action should any environmental issues arise. We believe the costs of capital expenditures related to environmental liabilities will not have a material impact on the results of our operations, as such costs are typically borne by the sellers, previous owners, and tenants of our properties.
