ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Introduction
 
As used in this report, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, the "Company" and terms such as "we," "us" "our," and "AIRI" refer to Air Industries Group, a Nevada corporation, and its directly and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 
We are an aerospace and defense company. We manufacture and design structural parts and assemblies that focus on flight safety, including landing gear, arresting gear, engine mounts, flight controls, throttle quadrants, jet engines and other components. We also provide sheet metal fabrication of aerostructures, tube bending and welding services. Our products are currently deployed on a wide range of high profile military and commercial aircraft including Sikorsky's UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters, Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Northrop Grumman's E2 Hawkeye, Boeing's 777, Airbus' 380 commercial airliners and the US Navy F-18 and USAF F-16 fighter aircraft. Our Turbine Engine sector makes components for jet engines that are used on the USAF F-15, the Airbus A-330 and A-380, and the Boeing 777, in addition to a number of ground turbine applications.
 
We became a public company in 2005 when our net sales were approximately $30 million. At that time we had been manufacturing components and subassemblies for the defense and commercial aerospace industry for over 45 years and had established long term relationships with leading defense and aerospace manufacturers. Since becoming public we have completed a series of acquisitions of defense related businesses. Since January 1, 2015, we have made the following acquisitions:
 

· | In March 2015, we acquired Sterling Engineering Corporation (“Sterling”). Founded in 1941, Sterling provides complex machining services and its business is concentrated with aircraft jet engine and ground turbine manufacturers; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In September 2015, we acquired Compac Development Corporation (“Compac”). Founded in 1976, Compac specializes in the manufacture of RFI/EMI (Radio Frequency Interference – Electromagnetic Interference) shielded enclosures for electronic components.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In January 2017 we sold AMK Welding, Inc., which we had acquired in October 2014.
 
We currently divide our operations into three operating segments: Complex Machining; Aerostructures & Electronics; and Turbine Engine Components. As our businesses continue to develop and evolve, we may deem it appropriate to reallocate our companies into different operating segments and, once we achieve sufficient integration among our businesses, report as a unified company.
 
Complex Machining is currently comprised of Air Industries Machining (“AIM”) and Nassau Tool Works (“NTW”). Since the lease for the premises occupied by NTW expires in October 2018, we are relocating and consolidating the operations of NTW into the facilities of AIM in Bay Shore, New York, which is approximately six miles from the premises presently occupied by NTW on Long Island.
 
We previously relocated the operations of Miller Stuart, and Compac Development from their locations on Long Island to Welding Metallurgy’s facility in Hauppauge, Long Island NY. We are continuing to fully integrate these operations, and the operations of Woodbine Products, and Decimal Industries into the operations of Welding Metallurgy.

 Our Market
 
We operate primarily in the military and, to a lesser degree, commercial aviation industries. Defense revenues represent a preponderance of our sales. Our principal customers include Sikorsky Aircraft, Goodrich Landing Gear Systems, Northrop Grumman, the United States Department of Defense, GKN Aerospace, Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon, Piper Aircraft, M7 Aerospace, Vought Aerospace, Ametek/Hughes-Treitler and Airbus.
 
Our products are incorporated into many aircraft platforms, the majority of which remain in production, and of which there are a substantial number of operating aircraft in the fleets maintained by the military and commercial airlines. We believe that we are the largest supplier of flight critical parts to Sikorsky’s Black Hawk helicopter. We have made, or currently make, or have been awarded, products for the CH-47 Chinook helicopter, Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Northrop Grumman's E2 Hawkeye, Boeing's 777, Airbus' 380 commercial airliners, and the US Navy F-18 and USAF F-16 fighter aircraft. Our Turbine Engine Components segment makes components for jet engines that are used on the USAF F-15, the Airbus A-330 and A-380, and the Boeing 777, in addition to a number of non-military ground turbine applications.
 
Many of our products are "flight critical," essential to aircraft performance and safety on takeoff, during flight and when landing. These products require advanced certifications as a condition to being a supplier. For many of our products we are the sole or one of a limited number of sources of supply. Many of the parts we supply are subject to wear and tear or fatigue and are routinely replaced on aircraft on a time of service or flight cycle basis. Replacement demand for these products will continue, albeit at perhaps a lower rate, so long as an aircraft remains in service, which is usually many years after production has stopped.
 
On March 1, 2013, as a result of the continuing budget impasse, automatic government spending cuts termed the Sequester were implemented.  Our revenues, particularly those of our Complex Machining segment, were and continue to be impacted by a slowing of orders in anticipation of a reduction or shift in the mix of defense spending and there can be no assurance that our financial condition and results of operations will not be materially adversely impacted by future reductions in defense spending or a change in the mix of products purchased by defense departments in the United States or other countries, or the perception on the part of our customers that such changes are about to occur.  
 
The National Defense Authorization Act, which was approved in December 2016, provides for an increase in defense spending. President Donald Trump’s preliminary budget proposal provides for a further increase in military spending of approximately 10%. Despite these positive developments, there can be no assurance that any such increase in military spending will increase demand for the products we supply or otherwise benefit us.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our approach to sales and marketing can be best understood through the concept of customer alignment. The aerospace industry is dominated by a small number of large prime contractors and equipment manufacturers. These customers rely heavily upon subcontractors to supply quality parts meeting specifications on a timely and cost effective basis.  These customers and other customers we supply routinely rate their suppliers based on a variety of performance factors.  One of our principal goals is to be highly rated and thus relied upon by all of our customers.
 
The large prime contractors are increasingly seeking subcontractors who can supply and are qualified to integrate the fabrication of larger, more complex and more complete subassemblies. We seek to position ourselves within the supply chain of these contractors and manufacturers to be selected for subcontracted projects.  Successful positioning requires that we qualify to be a preferred supplier by achieving and maintaining independent third party quality approval certifications, specific customer quality system approvals and top supplier ratings through strong performance on existing contracts.  We believe that the various capabilities we have acquired through our acquisition program increase the likelihood we will qualify for and be awarded larger, more complex projects. As an example of our successful efforts to move up the supplier chain, our Aerostructures & Electronics segment has grown from being a supplier of welding services to being a supplier of welding subassemblies and is now a product integrator, providing customers with complete structural assemblies.

As part of our effort to become a product integrator and increase our value to our customers, we have recruited personnel to design products and to fabricate complete, fully-assembled products.  In our marketing efforts we let customers know that we now have employees with the talent and experience to manage the manufacture of sections of aircraft structures to be delivered to the final assembly phase of the aircraft manufacturing cycle, and customers have now engaged us for these services.
 
As we acquired new businesses, we often gained new or enhanced technical capabilities. When we sought to exploit these new capabilities by introducing to our existing customers newly acquired products and capabilities we previously lacked.  Businesses we acquired often introduced us to customers we had not previously supplied and we marketed to these customers the products and services they need which we historically provided.  This marketing effort has enabled us to grow some of the businesses we acquired and increased our value to our customers.  For example, the acquisition of the business of Nassau Tool Works in 2012 expanded our capabilities in the “turning” of metal components. This enhanced capability was important in our Complex Machining segment winning a large multi-year commercial aerospace contract to supply Thrust Struts to a unit of UTAS for use in the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbo Fan jet engine.
 
Initial contracts are usually obtained through competitive bidding against other qualified subcontractors, while follow-on contracts are usually retained by successfully performing initial contracts. The long term business of each of our current operating segments generally benefits from barriers to entry resulting from investments, certifications, familiarization with the needs and systems of customers, and manufacturing techniques developed during the initial manufacturing phase.   As our business base grows with targeted customers, we endeavor to develop each of our relationships to one of a “partnership” where we participate in the resolution of pre-production design and build issues, and initial contracts are obtained as single source awards and follow-on pricing is determined through negotiations.  Despite these efforts a minority of our sales are based on negotiated prices.
 
Our Backlog 
 
Our backlog is best understood by looking at our operating segments independently.
 
Within our Complex Machining and Turbine Engine Components segments, the production cycle of products can extend from several months to a year or longer. This gives rise to significant backlogs as customers must order product with sufficient lead time to ensure timely delivery. In contrast, the production cycle for a significant majority of the products produced in our Aerostructures & Electronics segment is much shorter, a matter of several weeks or a few months. This shorter cycle allows customers to delay orders resulting in a much smaller backlog.
 
We have a number of long-term multi-year General Purchase Agreements or GPA’s with several of our customers. These agreements specify part numbers, specifications and prices of the covered products for a specified period, but do not authorize immediate production and shipment. Shipments are authorized periodically by the customer to fit their production schedule. We recently received a renewal of our multi-year contract with Sikorsky, MY9, for the years 2018 to 2023. This contract is for $ 47 million worth of product during this period. This is the third multi-year contract award we have received from Sikorsky.
 
Our "firm backlog" includes only fully authorized orders received for products to be delivered within the forward 18-month period. As of March 1 2017, our 18-month "firm funded backlog" was approximately $98 million.

Competition
 
Winning a new contract is highly competitive. For the most part we manufacture to customer designs and specifications, and compete against companies that have similar manufacturing capabilities in a global marketplace. Consequently, the ability to obtain contracts requires providing quality products at competitive prices. To accomplish this requires that we strive for continuous improvement in our capabilities to assure our competitiveness and provide value to our customers. Our marketing strategy involves developing long-term ongoing working relationships with customers. These relationships enable us to develop entry barriers to would-be competitors by establishing and maintaining advanced quality approvals, certifications and tooling investments that are difficult and expensive to duplicate. Despite these barriers to entry, many of our competitors are well-established subcontractors engaged in the supply of aircraft parts and components to prime military contractors and commercial aviation manufacturers. Among our competitors are; Monitor Aerospace, a division of Stellex Aerospace; Hydromil, a division of Triumph Aerospace Group; Heroux Aerospace and Ellanef Manufacturing, a division of Magellan Corporation.
 
Many of our competitors are larger enterprises or divisions of significantly larger companies having greater financial, physical and technical resources, and the capabilities to timelier respond under much larger contracts.
 
Raw Materials and Replacement Parts
 
The manufacturing process for certain products, particularly those for which we serve as product integrator, requires significant purchases of raw materials, hardware and subcontracted details. As a result, much of our success in profitably meeting customer demand for these products requires efficient and effective subcontract management. Price and availability of many raw materials utilized in the aerospace industry are subject to volatile global markets. Most suppliers of raw materials are unwilling to commit to long-term contracts at fixed prices. This is a substantial risk as our strategy often involves long term fixed price commitments to our customers. Recently, we have had difficulties in securing timely shipments of raw materials from certain vendors due to our liquidity problems.
Future Expansion Strategy
 
Since the 1990s, the aerospace and defense industries have undergone radical consolidation and realignment. The largest prime contractors have merged or been acquired resulting in fewer, and much larger, entities. Some examples are Boeing which acquired McDonnell Douglas; Lockheed Martin, formed by Lockheed's acquisition of Martin Marietta, together with the aerospace divisions of General Dynamics; Northrop Grumman, which fused together Northrop, Grumman, Westinghouse and Litton Industries into one entity. Where once there were nine companies there are now just three. In November 2015, Lockheed Martin acquired Sikorsky from United Technologies.
 
The consolidation of the prime contractors has caused a similar consolidation of suppliers. Major contractors seek to streamline and reduce the cost of managing supply chains by buying both larger quantities and more complete sub-assemblies from fewer suppliers. This has led to increased competitive pressure on many smaller firms. To survive in this environment, suppliers must invest in systems and infrastructures capable of interfacing with and meeting the needs of prime contractors. We have made the effort to do so since becoming a public company in 2005. Suppliers with $15-$100 million in annual sales, referred to as the “Tier III and IV Manufacturing Sector,” must become fully capable of working interactively in a computer aided three dimensional automated engineering environment and must have independent third party quality system certifications. We believe this industry trend will increase pressure on smaller aerospace/defense critical component manufacturers, the Tier III and IV suppliers, as the cost of upgrading their systems to achieve the level of connectivity necessary to work interactively with prime contractors, to the extent they have not already done so, will adversely impact their profit margins. Our acquisitions are part of our strategy to react to and benefit from this market environment.
 
We intend to increase our business through internal growth and accretive acquisitions.  Our ability to make acquisitions is dependent, in part, on our available cash and upon our ability to raise debt or equity as necessary to complete any acquisition. Our current focus is to utilize cash to return to profitable operations.

Employees 
 
As of March 1, 2017, we employed approximately 366 people. Of these, approximately 42 were in administration, 29 were in sales and procurement, and 295 were in manufacturing.
 
Air Industries Machining, one of the components of our Complex Machining segment, is a party to a collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”) with the United Service Workers, IUJAT, Local 355 (the "Union") with which we believe we maintain good relations. The Agreement, dated January 1, 2016, expires December 31, 2018 and covers all of AIM's production personnel, of which there are approximately 104 people. AIM is required to make a monthly contribution to each of the Union's United Welfare Fund and the United Services Worker's Security Fund. This is the only pension benefit required by the Agreement and the Company is not obligated for any future defined benefit to retirees. The Agreement contains a "no-strike" clause, whereby, during the term of the Agreement, the Union will not strike and AIM will not lockout its employees.
 
All of our employees are covered under a co-employment agreement with ADP.
 
Regulations
 
Environmental Regulation; Employee Safety
 
We are subject to regulations administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, various state agencies and county and local authorities acting in cooperation with federal and state authorities. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions that require us to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous chemicals and substances. The extensive regulatory framework imposes compliance burdens and financial and operating risks on us. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose civil and criminal fines in the case of violations.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA") imposes strict, joint and several liability on the present and former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 ("RCRA") regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. New York and Connecticut, the states where all of our production facilities are located, also have stringent laws and regulations governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, counterparts of CERCLA and RCRA. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which requires employers to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, obligates employers to provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances.
 
Federal Aviation Administration
 
We are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have never been subject to such fines or disqualifications.

Government Contract Compliance
 
Our government contracts and those of many of our customers are subject to the procurement rules and regulations of the United States government, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Many of the contract terms are dictated by these rules and regulations. During and after the fulfillment of a government contract, we may be audited in respect of the direct and allocated indirect costs attributed to the project. These audits may result in adjustments to our contract costs. Additionally, we may be subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations because of our participation in government procurement. Any inquiry or investigation can result in fines or limitations on our ability to continue to bid for government contracts and fulfill existing contracts.
 
We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits required for the operation of our business.
