Item 1. Business
Corporate History and Background
 
The Company incorporated as a Nevada corporation on March 2, 2016 by the filing of articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada under the name Glolex, Inc.
 
On June 25, 2019, Maksim Charniak, the Company’s then sole executive officer and director and the owner of 3,000,000 shares (pre-stock split) of the Company’s common stock, sold all of his shares of common stock of the Company to Amer Samad, resulting in a change of control of the Company. As part of that transaction, Mr. Charniak resigned from all of his officer and director positions, and Mr. Samad was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company, and was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company. Mr. Samad also purchased 1,167,937 shares (pre-stock split) of the Company’s common stock in a series of private transactions, resulting in Mr. Samad owning 4,167,937 shares (pre-stock split) of the Company’s common stock, or approximately 95.6% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company.
 
On March 5, 2020, the Company filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to, among other things, (i) increase the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 100,000,000, (ii) create and authorize 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, and (iii) effect a 12.6374:1 forward stock split of the common stock. In addition, on March 16, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change the name of the Company from Glolex Inc. to Omnia Wellness Inc. On April 15, 2020, the stock of the Company began trading on the OTC Pink market under the symbol “OMWS”.
 
On April 17, 2020, we entered into a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Omnia Wellness Corporation (formerly known as Bed Therapies Inc.), a Texas corporation (“Omnia Corp.”), and the beneficial stockholders of Omnia Corp. to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Omnia Corp. The transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement were consummated on January 5, 2021, and, pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, among other things, all outstanding shares of common stock of Omnia Corp., no par value, or the Omnia Corp. Shares, were exchanged for shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, based on the exchange ratio of one share of our common stock for every one Omnia Corp. Share. We refer herein to the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, collectively, as the Acquisition. Accordingly, we acquired 100% of Omnia Corp. in exchange for the issuance of 10,000,000 (not adjusted to reflect our 15:1 forward stock split on April 6, 2021) shares of our common stock and Omnia Corp. became our wholly-owned subsidiary. As of the closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”), Mr. Samad, resigned as an officer and director of the Company and agreed to cancel 52,656,888 (pre-stock split) shares of our common stock owned beneficially and of record by him as part of the conditions to Closing, which were cancelled immediately following the Closing. The Company also issued an aggregate of 1,269,665 (pre-stock split) shares of common stock on January 5, 2021 as a result of the conversion in accordance with their terms of outstanding convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $539,000.

As of immediately prior to the closing of the Acquisition, we entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement with RZI Consulting LLC (the “Assignment Agreement”), pursuant to which RZI Consulting LLC assumed substantially all of our remaining assets and liabilities through the closing of the Acquisition. Accordingly, as of the closing of the Acquisition, we had no assets or liabilities (other than relating to general and administrative expenses).
 
Following the Acquisition, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Omnia Corp., now develops and markets products for wellness and physical therapy markets, using patented dry-hydro therapy equipment that the Company plans to offer and sell in medical and fitness markets.
 
On April 6, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to (i) increase the Company’s authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 1,500,000,000, (ii) increase the Company’s authorized shares of “blank check” preferred stock from 10,000,000 to 150,000,000, and (iii) effect a 1:15 forward stock split of the common stock.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 999 18th St., Suite 3000, Denver, CO 80202, and our telephone number is 303-325-3738. Our website address is www.omniawellness.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Business Plan
 
The Company’s post-Acquisition mission is to redefine the massage industry by introducing affordable, “on demand” massage memberships through a network of retail locations, which we refer to as Relaxation Centers, which feature a patented, touchless SOLAJET™ massage, a technology equivalent to hands-on massage. The Company seeks to become the leading provider of therapeutic massage and the most recognized brand in the massage category through the rapid and focused expansion of Relaxation Centers in key markets throughout the U.S. and Europe. The goal is not only to capture a significant share of the existing market but also to expand the massage market as a whole by attracting a large segment of potential customers who are averse to human touch.
 
The Company plans to introduce a disruptive business model into the traditional massage industry by delivering the important benefits of massage in a more affordable and convenient way. The Company has created a unique and expandable business model that the Company believes breaks through the main barriers of massage which include cost, scheduling, and quality/consistency.
 
Central to the Company’s business plan is the creation of Relaxation Centers, which are premium, spa-like locations that can be located, and an appointment booked, by customers or “members” using a smartphone app or the web (massage on demand). The Company expects that each Relaxation Center will have an average of ten patented dry-hydrotherapy SOLAJET™ massage systems where customers will receive a private, deeply relaxing, consistent and therapeutic massage. The Company believes that the experience is equal to a traditional hands-on massage provided by an experienced, licensed masseuse. The SOLAJET™ massage systems are designed to permit customers to control virtually every aspect of the massage session by the touch of a button.

The Company’s retail membership model is currently based upon a price from $5 to $10 per fifteen minute session. The Company believes that the combined experience of deep tissue massage, therapeutic heat and proprietary wave therapy is so significant, the effects of a one hour hands-on massage can be felt in as little as one fifteen minute session. Due to this technology advantage, the Company expects to operate the Relaxation Centers with a minimal amount of staffing, as well as potentially franchise Relaxation Centers to third parties to enhance the rate of growth. Based on projected usage rates determined by us after multiple years of product development and market testing, the Company estimates that a single SOLAJET™ massage system may generate approximately $60,000 in annual revenue with a target gross margin of approximately 60%.
 
Research and Development
 
To develop our proprietary technology and prepare our product for commercialization, Omnia Corp. and its founder and affiliates have spent multiple years designing and placing over 500 units in high volume usage commercial settings. This product verification program was important to validate the product’s reliability, performance, consumer features and production capacity. The Company does not incur material research and development expenses.
Manufacturing
 
The Company outsources its manufacturing pursuant to a Contract Services Agreement with DryRX, LLC dated as of January 1, 2020, which replaced and superseded the Contract Services Agreement with DryRX, LLC dated as of July 22, 2018 which expired in accordance with its terms. The Contract Services Agreement, among other things, provides that DryRX shall provide manufacturing and support services on behalf of the Company, and shall be responsible for the manufacturing oversight and production operations of the Company’s products. In return, the Company is obligated to pay to DryRX a fee equal to 10% of net sales less cost-of-goods-sold and all expenses associated with the services. DryRX is owned and controlled by Steve Howe’s brother.
Market Analysis
 
The global health and wellness industry had revenue of over $4.5 trillion per year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and, assuming the pandemic wanes in 2021 as a result of available vaccines and the global, national and local economies rebound, will continue to afford great opportunities for companies that offer innovative solutions to the challenges faced by our aging population. Now more than ever, people suffer from tension/stress, chronic pain, lack of exercise and a broad range of conditions which may be alleviated or treated by massage. Leading healthcare professionals generally agree that massage not only feels good, but can be very good for a user’s health. Massage therapy is estimated to be a $45 billion per year industry worldwide, according to Associated Bodywork & Massage Professionals. Furthermore, the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) estimates that massage therapy was a $18 billion industry in the U.S. alone in 2018. By comparison, in 2005, massage therapy was projected to be a $6 to $11 billion a year industry. Between July 2017 and July 2018, surveys indicated that roughly 47.5-63.6 million adult Americans (19%-28%) had a massage at least once, and U.S. massage customers receive about 230 million massages a year at an average price of $65.00 per massage (not including customary tip).
 
The Company believes that its technology has been and will continue to be embraced by some of the leading professionals in the wellness market. The Company has received testimonials which describe experiences ranging from how the product has made a big difference in daily personal lives to how commercial providers have enjoyed significant profits by charging for clients to use our deeply relaxing and therapeutic technology.

The Company did see a decrease in sales of its available products during 2020 which it believes is a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as gyms and other locations were closed and communities and individuals were quarantined for parts of the year. The Company did start to see indicators late in the third quarter of 2020 and early in the fourth quarter of 2020 that business was starting to pick up again on the medical side. The Company believes that as gyms, chiropractors and other medical facilities begin to open to larger capacities after vaccinations become more widespread, the Company’s products will be a better option for the locations due to the ability to be “touchless,” which has become more necessary over the last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the SOLAJET™ massage system allows the option of getting a treatment without being in a room with another person. Management believes that this will allow an additional way to market the beds over the next several years.
 
Products and Services
 
SOLAJET™ Massage System
 
The SOLAJET™ massage system is a patented and unique touch-less treatment that helps reduce pain, improve range of motion, revive and rejuvenate the body. Inside the system, a powerful traveling water jet performs a relaxing full body Endo-Kinetic™ treatment but is also able to isolate to any part of the body at the touch of a button. Highlights include:

● | Rated equivalent to hands-on massage therapy, and 8 to 1 over a hot tub or massage chair experience based on Company-administered trials and surveys. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Deep tissue penetration, therapeutic heat and a flushing body “wave” motion combine 3 therapies in one, delivering a similar feeling of an hour long traditional massage in as little as 15 minutes. 
● | Users remain clothed and dry. No oils, disrobing or getting wet. 
● | SOLAJET™ massage system features a full body massage with user controlled programs, pressure and custom adjustments via a touch screen controller or smartphone app. 


● | Company-administered surveys have suggested a 93% interest in continued use, and the system also appeals to a significant percentage of the population who will not normally seek a massage because they do not like personal touch. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AQUAVIVE™ Recliner System
 
The AQUAVIVE™ Recliner System, expected to be introduced in 2021, is a first in class, zero-gravity platform that uses water infused chambers to stimulate, soothe and compress soft tissue, delivering massage-like feeling while being able to rapidly vary temperature from 50 to 95 Degrees in approximately 1 minute. Highlights include:

● | Rapid cooling or heating at the touch of a button; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Water roller system to ensure comfort and effective massage; 
● | Painless massage patterns mimic hand motion; and 
● | Seamless/sanitary cover system for simple disinfection between uses.

Relaxation Centers
 
The Company’s business model is to create a national chain of BodyStop® “Relaxation Centers”. Earlier Company focus groups have shown that individuals introduced to the proposed BodyStop® Relaxation Center concept had a high interest in the services offered. The Company also had similar results selling SOLAJET™ memberships in commercial settings with a compelling conversion rate for users to purchase a monthly massage membership. The Company believes this is a strong indication that retention or membership sales will be high once consumers experience a SOLAJET™ massage in a relaxing and stress-free environment. The Company’s first BodyStop® location is currently under construction on Long Island, New York, with an expected opening date of August 1, 2021.
 
The Company intends to offer the following at each SOLAJET™ location:
 

● | Luxurious feeling, open and “stress free” environment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Relaxing pre-massage/recovery area provides the soothing tone of relaxation with an arrangement of colors, scents, lighting and décor. 
● | Privacy massage rooms for security and mental relaxation. 
● | “Hydration stations” - customizable energy water dispenser to help relax and replenish the body after massage. 
● | Sign-up/Sign-in kiosk – Registration will be done through a smartphone app, the internet or an in-store kiosk. The in-store kiosk will also be available to learn more about SOLAJET™. 
● | Consumers are able to control the massage and where to focus force via a control panel. 
● | SOLAJET™ “No Tip” policy creates a high value, cashless retail environment. 
● | Approximately ten SOLAJET™ massage systems. 

 
For the Relaxation Centers, the Company plans to test the names, product branding and marketing using professional marketing agencies and intends to hire consultants to develop the store layout and associated marketing concepts. The locations are intended to represent a “human oasis” or an affordable “recharge station” for our stressed-out world. The Company intends to work closely with its franchise consultants during the testing and modeling of the centers to make certain any franchise offering has the best opportunity to be successful.
 
Furthermore, the value proposition for each member of the Company’s Relaxation Centers is expected to be as follows:
 

● | A new therapeutic massage experience with wider appeal than traditional massage; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Affordable monthly membership program – making the luxury of a regular massage attainable; 


● | Convenient booking system making massage “on-demand”; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Convenient locations; 
● | Relaxing and welcoming atmosphere; 
● | High customer service focus – minimal staff administrative burden allows center employees to focus a majority of their time of service and hospitality; and 
● | User friendly control system using touch-screens to manage the “touchless” massage system.

Other Products and Offerings
 
The Company intends to introduce from time to time other products and service offerings. For instance, the Company is intending to introduce the SolaProTM mobile deep-tissue massage gun, which it believes will provide superior soft tissue treatment when compared to other products on the market.
Plan of Operations
 
The Company intends to implement an aggressive go-to-market plan intended to validate its business model, including to:
 

● | Engage a professional branding and marketing group to develop the Company’s Relaxation Center’s name and marketing collateral (print, web, mobile and social media). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Employ a design consultant to properly design the Relaxation Centers’ layout, theme, lighting and structure. 
● | Secure a real estate specialist to determine proper retail locations based on population, demographics and foot traffic. 
● | Initially launch three Relaxation Centers in the Denver Metro area (or a similar metropolitan area) to validate the business model. 
 | Furthermore, the Company plans to market the pre and post-launch of its Relaxation Centers by: 
● | Driving customer flow to the Relaxation Centers by building brand awareness through conveniently located, highly visible locations and by using traditional retail-oriented marketing and customer acquisition techniques and by participating in community awareness events. 
● | Heavily promoting “free massages” as an attractive means to drive traffic to the locations for the prospective customer’s first trial massage. We believe that the history of user usage patterns predicts a high retention or desire for ongoing use once someone experiences the SOLAJET™ massage in a Relaxation Center. 
● | Developing a social media presence. 
● | Creating media and public relations exposure. 

 
After the Company’s Relaxation Centers have been in service for a reasonable test period, management plans to evaluate each location’s results and determine the proper course of action for the identification and installation of future locations. If results from the test market demonstrate that the concept is profitable and scalable, the Company intends to build up the headquarter organization and expects to open approximately 50 to 100 company owned Relaxation Centers in the U.S. within the following 12 - 24 months, subject to the availability of funds.
 
Once the U.S. organization has been established, the Company expects to expand first into Europe. The Company’s target is to have 1,000 Relaxation Centers in the U.S. and additional locations in Europe, within 6-8 years after the initial launch. The Company believes that there will be opportunities to expand the business into other areas worldwide, if and when the Company has the resources available.

In addition to a national chain of company-owned BodyStop® Relaxation Centers, the Company is considering franchising the Relaxation Centers, and sell SOLAJET™ memberships in commercial settings through the purchase of monthly massage memberships. Along with the retail and commercial elements of the business plan, the Company expects to launch a medical rental program targeting physical therapists and chiropractors, which we believe removes the cost factor that would otherwise prevent practitioners from purchasing our products - a major barrier of entry. Our first beta franchise center is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
Revenue Share Model
 
The Company has also tested, and now offers, the installation and operation of a smaller version of the Relaxation Centers in a limited number of the nation’s leading health and fitness clubs. For instance, the Company and LA Fitness have opened the initial BodyStop® Center located in LA Fitness, Mission Viejo, California in January 2019, and a second location in Irvine, California opened in July 2019. Once the Company has confirmation of the financial assumptions, the Company’s current plan is to open up this smaller version of the BodyStop® Relaxation Centers in 100 to 300 LA Fitness centers. Due to Covid related shutdowns in California in 2020, the expansion plans were delayed. In June 2021, the Company and LA Fitness entered into a new license agreement to expand the number of modalities offered at each LA Fitness location where the Company was operating prior to the Covid shut down and to expand the same package of modalities to other locations as well. The new license provides for LA Fitness sales and training personnel to sell BodyStop® memberships along side LA Fitness memberships. The licensee fee arrangement has been converted from a fixed monthly fee to a percentage of the gross profit revenue. Our value proposition to this and other potential partnerships include:

● | No capital investment by the fitness partner, as the Company will install and own the beds; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Profitability drivers utilizing existing members or traffic, assisted by co-marketing with our partner; 
● | Service and support by the Company; 
● | Turn-key marketing support; 
● | Kiosk enrollment and operation; and 
● | The Company shares the revenue with the partner, in the range of 60% to 70% of gross revenue to the Company and 30% to 40% to the partner. 

Target Customers
 
Potential retail target customers for the SOLAJET™ massage experience include the following:
 

● | Employees exposed to high levels of stress; 
--+------------------------------------------------
● | Sedentary workers; 
● | Manual and strenuous labor employees; 
● | Seniors;

-


● | Overweight individuals; and 
--+------------------------------------------------
● | Individuals with chronic pain/disabilities. 

 
The Company expects the physiological massage experience, the center’s relaxing environment, ongoing massage education and overall financial value to resonate well with potential consumers, creating a strong consumer brand and loyal members.
 
The Company plans to create a focused marketing plan targeting specific segments of the population. The emphasis of the marketing messages will be on the specific benefits of consistent massage as a means of providing long term and short term health benefits.
 
We are also building a business unit to focus on the healthcare and wellness professional market, to sell or rent SOLAJET™ massage systems to professionals, with the initial focus on the chiropractic and physical therapy industries where pricing and terms can range from $600-$800/month per rental to approximately $20,000 for purchase.
 
Competition
 
We intend to compete with private spas and massage centers. Companies within the traditional massage market historically have been highly fragmented. Recently, national and regional massage chains have emerged offering discounted pricing for a monthly massage commitment. Top chains include: Massage Envy®, Zen Massage®, Massage Heights®, and Hand & Stone®. These chains attempt to “standardize” the massage category by assuring customers a licensed massage at a predictable price to secure continued usage.
 
Commercial competition includes four main competitors who are solely focused on selling water-based massage systems into the medical and leisure markets. Each command a high sales price of $15,000 - $35,000, and management believes that its competitors offer inferior massage experiences compared to the SOLAJET™ massage system. To date, based on publicly available information, none have initiated a relaxation center or franchise model and each are focused on growing and expanding the dry-hydrotherapy segment, primarily in the fitness market.
 
Some of our expected competitors currently have significantly greater resources than we do, have previously validated their business plan and launched their business, and have may greater resources for product development, sales and marketing, additional lines of products and the ability to offer financial incentives such as rebates, bundled products or discounts on other product lines that we may not be able to provide.
 
We intend to compete based on pricing, convenience and superior products and experience.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.

-


Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of our products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. To protect our proprietary secrets and competitive technologies, we have obtained and are seeking to further obtain patent, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property protection on our products whenever appropriate. As of the date hereof, the Company holds the following patents or pending patents through its exclusive license with Drywave Technologies USA, Inc. described further below:
 

Description | Patent No. | Date Issued | Expiration 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+------------------
Systems and Methods for Providing Dry Hydrotherapy to a Reclined Human Subject | 7,311,683 | December 25, 2007 | December 25, 2027
Dry Hydrotherapy Bed | D662,211 | June 19, 2012 | June 19, 2026 
Water Encapsulated and Mechanical Hybrid Body Massage Chair with Rapid Heating and Cooling Control | U.S. Provisional Application, Serial No. 62/862,777, filed on June 18, 2019 | Pending | Pending 

 
Trademarks include SOLAJET™, MassageWave®, BodyStop®, AquaVive® and several related URLs.
 
In addition to the patents, there are a number of proprietary processes in the design, assembly and manufacturing of the SOLAJET™ massage system. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property in the continued development and commercialization of our technologies and products and to prevent others from infringing on our intellectual property is important to success. Our basic patent strategy is to augment our current portfolio by applying for patents on new developments and obtaining licenses to promising product candidates and related technologies. We also maintain various trade secrets which we have chosen not to reveal by filing for patent protection. Our issued patents and patent applications provide protection for our core technologies. In addition to the foregoing patent activity, several continuations-in–part and international patents have been filed. Patent applications related to our proprietary aqua roller system, rapid heating and cooling systems have been filed.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require our employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, board of directors, technical review board and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. We also require signed confidentiality or material transfer agreements from any company that is to receive our confidential information. In the case of employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

On April 30, 2019, Omnia Corp. entered into a worldwide exclusive license with Drywave Technologies USA, Inc., which is the owner or exclusive licensee of certain of the technology, patent and other intellectual property rights, and know-how related to our dry hydrotherapy massage products. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the license agreement, the Company received intellectual property rights to manufacture, use, and offer for sale all the products related to the patents and trademarks for dry hydrotherapy therapy technologies. The license fee to acquire the technology is $2,000,000, all of which has been paid. The Company is also obligated to pay to Drywave a royalty of 3% of net sales beginning May 1, 2020 and continuing for the longer of the period in which there are valid patent claims or ten years. Drywave is wholly-owned by Steve Howe, our Executive Chairman.
 
Our success will also depend in part on our ability to commercialize our technology without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Although we have conducted freedom of use patent searches no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have an adverse effect on our ability to market our technology or maintain our competitive position with respect to our technology. If our technology components, products, processes or other subject matter are claimed under other existing United States or foreign patents or are otherwise protected by third party proprietary rights, we may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our technology. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure to either develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain such licenses could result in delays in marketing our proposed technology or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease our development and commercialization of our technology.
 
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries can be a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of health related products. Currently, other than a Class I medical device registration form and annual fee payment, none of our products require formal regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Class I medical devices are those products deemed to be low-risk, and as such are subject to the least amount of regulatory control. As a business strategy, we intend to conduct some key clinical studies to provide a basis to make medical claims regarding the use of our SOLAJET™ and AQUAVIVE™ products.
Employees
 
As of July 28, 2021, we had 16 full-time employees. These employees oversee day-to-day operations of the Company supporting management and leading engineering, manufacturing, intellectual property and administration functions of the Company. We also use the services of consultants as-needed from time to time. We are subject to labor laws and regulations within our locations in the U.S. These laws and regulations principally concern matters such as pensions, paid annual vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday and work week, minimum wages, overtime pay, insurance for work-related accidents, severance pay and other conditions of employment. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
 
SEC Filings
 
We file Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and current event reports on Form 8-K, and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. You can read our SEC filings over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
