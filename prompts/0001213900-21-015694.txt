Overview
 
We have developed the Pure-Vu System (the “Pure-Vu System”), a medical device that has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). In June 2019, the 510(k) premarket notification for the second-generation of the Pure-Vu System was reviewed and cleared by the FDA. The second-generation of our Pure-Vu System has received CE Mark approval in the European Economic Area. The Pure-Vu System is indicated to help facilitate the cleaning of a poorly prepared colon during the colonoscopy procedure. The device integrates with standard and slim colonoscopes to enable safe and rapid cleansing during the procedure while preserving established procedural workflow and techniques by irrigating the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid (water), feces and other bodily fluids and matter. We believe that the technology may be useful in the future as a tool to help reduce user dependency on conventional pre-procedural bowel prep regimens. Challenges with bowel preparation for inpatient colonoscopy represent a significant area of unmet need that directly affects clinical outcomes and increases the cost of care for a hospital in a market segment where most of the reimbursement is under a bundle payment based on a Medicare Severity Diagnostic Related Group (a “MS-DRG”). Based on our review and analysis of 2019 market data and 2021 projections for the U.S. and Europe, as obtained from iData Research Inc., we estimate that during 2021 approximately 1.5 million inpatient colonoscopy procedures will be performed in the U.S. and approximately 4.8 million inpatient colonoscopy procedures will be performed worldwide. The Pure-Vu System does not currently have a unique reimbursement code with any private or governmental third-party payors in any country. We began commercialization in the fourth quarter of 2019, with the first commercial placements of our second generation Pure-Vu System as part of our initial U.S. market launch targeting early adopter hospitals. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales until the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided and we expand our commercialization efforts for the Pure-Vu System, which is subject to significant uncertainty.
Recent Developments
 
Due to the recent outbreak around the world of the highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus COVID-19, the extent and duration of which is difficult to predict, our sales efforts with targeted early adopter hospitals continue to be disrupted. This disruption is specifically related to our limited on-site access at hospital accounts, an overall reduction in GI procedures, and physician and clinician time primarily being focused on care for COVID-19 patients. This has presented a temporary slow-down in commercial activities, but we expect a recovery as broader vaccination occurs in particular with front-line healthcare workers. Projecting when new technology evaluations and non-critical hospital procedures will normalize is challenging, and the ability of hospital systems to make capital investments in new medical technologies remains impacted. In addition to sales disruptions, we have also experienced an overall slowdown in clinical program activities.
 
We completed the move of the manufacturing of our loading fixture from RMS Company to Sanmina Corporation during 2020. As part of the move, we also incorporated some enhancements in the loading fixture based on feedback from the initial launch of our second-generation of the Pure-Vu System that can further reduce the time of setup. Over time, this switch has the potential to improve our overall efficiency as the Workstation component of our Pure-Vu System is already being manufactured by Sanmina Corporation.
 
Due to nationwide COVID-19 lockdowns in Israel, our research & development activity were disrupted in the second quarter of 2020 and early part of the third quarter of 2020, but we are now moving forward at a steady pace. In our Israeli innovation center, we are using a flexible in office work plan to reduce the risk of future work disruption should any employee contract the virus. To date we have had no issues in our facility.
 
Our clinical research efforts are focused on critical patient populations such as acute lower GI bleeds, where time to a successful colonoscopy can be clinically impactful. We are working with a major hospital system on a study that has recently received IRB approval focused on rapid examination of significant lower GI bleed patients. In this study the patients will not ingest any purgative based preparation and only receive two tap water enemas prior to the procedure.
 
At this date, we cannot fully predict the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our financial results and operations and we continue to closely monitor the situation. We have been encouraged by an increase in GI procedural volume, as well as an uptake in hospital access and physician availability in certain parts of the United States where the prevalence of COVID-19 has lessened. We intend to continue to be nimble in our commercial approach and explore all options with respect to how we can best minimize the negative impact of COVID-19 on our business.
 
In an effort to manage the lack of in-person access to U.S. hospitals as a result of the pandemic, in June 2020, we officially launched the Motus GI mobile app that provides end-users with on-demand access to a full spectrum of Pure-Vu System support and educational resources. This new mobile interface provides Pure-Vu System users instant access to on-demand video support and training resources, including demo and intra-procedural videos, live set-up tutorials, and case studies. The app can be customized to individual hospitals, enabling the administration and healthcare teams to share and track protocols and upload external materials specific to their respective endoscopy department. It is available to all Pure-Vu System users via the ‘imsmart’ umbrella in the App store. This new mobile solution is a part of a larger effort to diversify and digitize much of the go-to-market content for the Pure-Vu System, which is being adopted by a growing number of U.S. hospitals. If there are additional waves of COVID-19 in the Unites States, we intend to continue to leverage these new digital tools to ensure commercial efforts and training continues with minimal interruption.

Market Overview
 
Colonoscopies are one of the most frequently performed medical procedures with over 20 million colonoscopies performed in the United States each year and close to 55 million worldwide, per 2019 iData Research Inc. Based on our review and analysis of this market data as well as 2021 projections for the U.S. and Europe, as obtained from iData Research Inc., we estimate that during 2021 approximately 1.5 million inpatient colonoscopy procedures in a hospital setting will be performed in the U.S. and approximately 4.8 million worldwide. A majority of total colonoscopies in the U.S. and worldwide are performed as outpatient procedures at an ambulatory endoscopy center and/or hospital outpatient departments. Some colonoscopies are performed to help diagnose and treat lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), anemia or infection, with the bulk of procedures performed to detect and prevent colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the U.S. with approximately 150,000 new cases anticipated to be diagnosed and more than 50,000 deaths anticipated in 2021, according to the American Cancer Society. According to the CDC (2018), approximately 31% of eligible patients are still not current with their CRC screening in the U.S. Over the past few decades, CRC has been demonstrated to be one of the most preventable cancers through the use of colonoscopies.
 
Despite the pervasiveness and effectiveness of colonoscopy, a key ongoing clinical challenge of the procedure is that patients are required to undergo a potent pre-procedure bowel preparation regimen to try to ensure that the colon is fully cleansed to enable clear visualization of the tissue. Successful bowel preparation is one of the most important factors in delivering a thorough, high quality exam and is well documented to have a direct impact on the adenoma detection rate (ADR), the rate of detecting pre-cancer anomalies in the colon tissue, which in turn predicts a decrease in CRC risk. An inadequately prepared colon can impact the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure and can lead to procedures having to be repeated earlier than the medical guidelines advise or can lead to failed procedures especially in the inpatient setting. Rescheduling the procedure is inconvenient to the patient (and many patients fail to come for their follow-up), creates inefficiencies in the provider’s workflow, and increases the length of hospital stay, each of which results in increased healthcare costs. The preparation regimen typically requires patients to be on a liquid diet for over 24 hours, drink up to four liters of a purgative, spend up to 12 hours prior to the exam periodically going to the bathroom to empty their bowels, and disrupting their daily activities, which could include missing work or other activities. The regimens can be highly disruptive and uncomfortable for many patients. In fact, approximately 57% of patients cite not wanting to take the bowel preparation as the number one deterrent for the procedure, as noted by Harwood et al., American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Further, it is estimated by HRA Healthcare Research & Analytics (2015) that approximately 23% of outpatients present with inadequately prepped colons, resulting in a number of colonoscopies that yield poor diagnostic accuracy or failed colonoscopies that must be repeated. For inpatients, this figure jumps to approximately 51% according to a recently published study by the Cleveland Clinic. It has also been reported that patients requiring frequent colonoscopies, such as CRC survivors and other surveillance patients, account for approximately 21% of the outpatient colonoscopies performed annually in the U.S., per Lieberman D.A. et.al., American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2005).
 
Inpatient Opportunity: improving efficiencies and shortening time to complete a successful colonoscopy
 
Inpatient colonoscopy is usually performed to diagnose the source of various gastrointestinal conditions such as lower GI bleeding or bowel pain. For an inpatient hospital stay, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, uses a prospective payment system, or PPS, based upon the MS-DRG payment groupings, to pay for hospital services with the goal of encouraging providers to minimize their costs. The DRG assignment is influenced by a combination of factors such as a patient’s sex, diagnosis at the time of discharge and procedures performed. Based on patient specific information, all hospital expenses for their care during an inpatient stay are packaged and assigned to one of over 700 MS-DRGs (“Medicare Severity – Diagnostics Related Groups”). According to Decision Driver Analytics, a reimbursement consulting agency, when a colonoscopy is performed as the primary procedure (no other procedures or complicating diagnosis), MSDRGs 395, 394 or 393 would apply which pay between $3,861 (without complications or major comorbidities) and $9,421 (with major complications and comorbidities), which are average figures subject to adjustment. The National Inpatient Sample (“NIS”) and other literature sources note that the cost for a standard hospital bed averages $2,298 and the cost for an intensive care unit (“ICU”) bed averages $6,546 per day in the U.S, so reducing the length of stay can save the hospital significant expense.
 
An inpatient colonoscopy is generally more problematic than an outpatient procedure due primarily to poorer quality bowel prep, which can lead to lower rates of successful completion of the procedure and a higher frequency of repeat procedures. Inpatients are difficult to prep as exemplified by inadequate bowel prep rates. Published studies have found that the inpatient population experiences rates of insufficiently prepped colons at the time of colonoscopy as high as 55%. This has been shown to lead directly to significantly longer hospital stays and other additional costs due to the need for repeated preps, repeated colonoscopies and additional diagnostic procedures. This is exemplified in a recently published study by the Cleveland Clinic that showed an inadequate preparation rate of 51% in the study population of 8,819 inpatients. The study noted that the 51% of the study population that were inadequately prepped stayed one day extra in the hospital compared to patients with adequate preparation. Another study, from Northwestern University Hospital System, showed an average hospital stay extension of two days and cost increase of as much as $8,000 per patient as a result of challenges associated with bowel preparation. We believe the Pure-Vu System may improve outcomes and lower costs for hospitals by potentially reducing the time to a successful colonoscopy, minimizing delayed and incomplete procedures, and improving the quality of an exam.

Our Pure-Vu Solution
 
Our system consists of a workstation controller and a single-use, disposable sleeve that fits over most standard and slim colonoscopes. Together with the colonoscope, the Pure-Vu System performs rapid, effective and efficient intra-procedural cleaning without compromising procedural workflow and techniques. The over-sleeve has an umbilical section that connects the disposable over-sleeve to the workstation. The over-sleeve is treated with a hydrophilic lubricious coating that reduces friction and allows for smooth advancement through the colon. The workstation, through a series of peristaltic pumps activated by foot pedals, delivers an irrigation medium of air and water that creates a pulsed vortex inside the colon to break up fecal matter while simultaneously evacuating the colon content into waste receptacles already used in a standard colonoscopy procedure. The proprietary smart sense suction (evacuation) system in the device has sensors built in that can detect the formation of a blockage and automatically clear it allowing the physician to remove significant debris from the patient. We received special 510(k) clearance from the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 for our first generation Pure-Vu System to adjust our labeling to simplify the process of removing the Pure-Vu System from a colonoscope and to support minor enhancements to the manufacturing of the system. The Pure-Vu System has been clinically demonstrated to be capable of cleaning poorly prepared colons in minutes. We are building an extensive intellectual property portfolio designed to protect key aspects of the system, including the pulsed vortex irrigation and auto-purge functions.
 


In June 2019, the 510(k) premarket notification for the second-generation (“Gen 2”) of the Pure-Vu System was reviewed and cleared by the FDA. We received the initial approval to affix the CE Mark to the Gen 2 Pure-Vu System in March 2020 and obtained an additional approval with all the latest upgrades in January 2021.
 
The Gen 2 Pure-Vu System includes two versions of the oversleeve for compatibility with both standard and slim colonoscopes. The Gen 2 Pure-Vu System has also been designed to improve the mobility and logistics in the setup of the system and retains all the same functionality as the first generation of the Pure-Vu System in terms of how it cleanses the colon. The Gen 2 Pure-Vu System Workstation has a reduced footprint and is mounted on a roll stand to allow nursing staff to easily move the Gen 2 Pure-Vu System to different procedure rooms or to the ICU as needed. The Gen 2 Pure-Vu System also has improvements that reduce the number of steps to set up the system and simplifies the loading process onto the colonoscope.

Pre-Clinical and Clinical Data & Safety
 
The Pure-Vu System has been studied in multiple clinical trials in patients receiving a reduced prep regime as well as a trial focused on the inpatient population. The Pure-Vu System was used in two multi-center clinical studies in the EU and Israel, and also a single center study in the US. The first study involved 49 patients and was completed in the second quarter of 2016. The second study was completed in June 2017 and involved 46 patients. Patients in these studies had a restricted diet for 18-24 hours and received a split dose of 20mg of over-the-counter Dulcolax® (bisocodyl). Patients did not take any liquid purgative traditionally prescribed for bowel preparation. The clinical data showing performance of the Pure-Vu System in these studies using the BBPS, is shown below. The clinical results from the 2016 study were presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week (“UEGW”) in October 2016. The clinical results from the 2017 study were presented at the UEGW in October 2017, showing similar results, as shown below. This study has recently been published in Endoscopy one of the top peer reviewed journals in the EU.
 
The third clinical study in the outpatient setting was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology (“ACG”) Annual Meeting in October 2018. This study was performed in the United States and showed that the Pure-Vu System demonstrated safe and effective colonic cleaning in the per protocol analysis of 46 patients receiving a reduced prep regimen. The study was initially designed to compare two different minimal bowel preparation regimens. Initially patients were randomized to receive one of two minimal bowel preparations: three doses of 17 gr. MiraLAX each mixed in 8.5 oz. of clear liquids or two doses of 7.5 oz. magnesium citrate (MgC) each taken with 19.5 oz. of clear liquid. A study amendment early on replaced the MiraLAX arm, due to obvious inferior Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (“BBPS”), a validated assessment instrument, scoring from the outset. The replacement arm consisted of two doses of 5 oz. MgC taken with 16 oz. of clear liquid. All patients were allowed to eat a low residue diet on the day prior and were asked to avoid seeds and nuts for five days prior to their procedure. Study objectives evaluated for each study arm included: (1) improvement of colon cleansing from presentation baseline to completion of the procedure (as assessed by the BBPS) through the use of the Pure-Vu System, (2) time required to reach the cecum, (3) total procedure time, and (4) safety. No significant differences were found between the three groups with regard to demographics or indication for colonoscopy. No serious adverse events related to the device were reported. The use of the Pure-Vu System enabled successful intraprocedural cleansing of the colon and ensured successful completion of all colonoscopies performed (100% success rate). Although there were only 46 patients in the study, there was a highly significant difference in the study population (p value <0.0001) between the baseline preparation and that seen post cleansing with the Pure-Vu System. The use of the Pure-Vu System added some time to the procedure, but the total procedure time was approximately 25 minutes in this study.
 
The chart below shows the outcome of the primary endpoint using the BBPS both pre and post use of the Pure-Vu System in a side by side fashion. It can be seen from the data that the high cleansing level achieved with the Pure-Vu System is consistent across the various studies.

REDUCE Study
 
At the Digestive Disease Week (DDW) conference in May of 2019 the results of the REDUCE study (“Reliable Endoscopic Diagnosis Utilizing Cleansing Enhancement”), a multi-center inpatient prospective trial designed to evaluate Pure-Vu System’s ability to consistently and reliably improve bowel preparation to facilitate a successful colonoscopy in a timely manner in patients who were indicated for a diagnostic colonoscopy, was presented. The study enrolled 95 hospitalized patients on schedule regardless of their level of pre-procedural bowel preparation. The primary endpoint for the study was improvement of bowel preparation from baseline to post procedure as assessed by the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (“BBPS”), which assesses the cleanliness of the each of the three segments of the colon on a 0 to 3 scale and requires a minimum score of 2 or better per segment to be considered adequately prepped.
 
For inpatients that received the Pure-Vu System, adequate bowel preparation improved from a baseline of 38% to 96% in segments evaluated. The analysis from the REDUCE study showed statistically significant improvement in every segment of the colon after Pure-Vu System use. The per segment BBPS improved from an average baseline of 1.74, 1.74 and 1.5 to 2.89, 2.91 and 2.86 respectively with a statistically significant p value of .001 for all three segments of the colon. The primary indication for patients enrolled in the study (68%) was a GI bleed. Acute GI bleeds can lead to hemodynamic instability and is a critical population to treat in an urgent fashion. Physicians were able to achieve a successful clinical outcome in 98% of patients in the study.
 
Current Clinical Studies
 
Our current clinical research efforts are focused on critical patient populations such as acute lower GI bleeds, where time to a successful colonoscopy can be clinically impactful. We are working with a major hospital system on a study that has recently received IRB approval focused on rapid examination of significant lower GI bleed patients. In this study the patients will not ingest any purgative based preparation and only receive two tap water enemas prior to the procedure. We are also evaluating additional studies focused on critical populations in both the inpatient and outpatient markets. As an example, studying the ability of the Pure-Vu System to impact outpatients that have a history of poor preparation that cannot get a quality exam and have to come back on a shortened surveillance interval may be of interest.
Intellectual Property
 
Our IP position comprises a portfolio covering highly innovative technologies rooted in systems and methods for cleaning body cavities with or without the use of an endoscope. Currently we have twelve granted or allowed patents in the U.S., fourteen patents in Asia (Japan, China and Hong Kong), and seven patents in the EU, with patent protection until at least 2036. In addition, we have 24 pending patent applications in various regions of the world with a focus on the U.S., EU and Japan. We also have one Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) worldwide patent application pending which can lead to additional National Phase applications in the above jurisdictions. We have registered trademarks for Motus GI and for the Pure-Vu System in the US, EU and other international jurisdictions. We also have a pending trademark application in the US to MICRO-PREP. 
 
Our portfolio of patents and patent applications focuses on cleaning body cavities in a safe and efficient manner, insertion, movement and steering of an endoscopic device within the body cavity in a predetermined direction; coordinated positioning of an endoscope with a suction device and cleaning systems with automatic self-purging features. Coverage includes critical aspects of our system that we believe are key to effectively and efficiently clean the colon or other cavities in the body. These aspects include cleansing jet methodologies, sensing and control of evacuation to avoid clogging, designs for easy attachment to endoscopes and cleaning segments under water.
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for Pure-Vu and to operate without infringing the proprietary right of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We strive to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents and trademarks, as well as through confidentiality provisions in our contracts. With respect to the Pure-Vu System, we endeavor to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and internationally on identified and potentially patentable aspects of the system. We cannot be sure that the patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology.

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
We also plan to continue to seek trademark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate. We intend to use these registered marks in connection with our research and development as well as our product candidates.
 
Competition 
    We do not believe that there are currently any direct competitors in the market, nor any known competing medical device under development, using similar technology to our technology. Currently the major colonoscope manufacturers (i.e., Olympus Corp, Pentax Medical, Fujifilm Medical) as well as some smaller equipment manufacturers (i.e., Medivators, Erbe) sell a lesser powered irrigation pump that can pump fluid through the auxiliary water jet or working channel of a colonoscope. Potentially competitive is an intra-procedural device under development by Medjet Ltd. MedJet’s device goes through the working channel of a scope, is used mostly for spot cleaning a small amount of debris and does not have the capability to fully clean the colon of large amounts of fecal matter. The MedJet product also requires the physician to remove it from the working channel during the procedure if they need to remove significant debris, polyps or take a biopsy, impacting the workflow of the procedure. There is also a device under development by a company named OTTek Ltd. The device is called the FIOT (Flow in Over Tube). The tube is noted as being able to create a channel between the endoscope and the inside of the over tube to facilitate the removal of debris. The competitive products mentioned are not currently separately reimbursed by private or government payors. There are over ten different preparation regimens used prior to colonoscopy today. Some are prescription medications and others are over-the-counter. Typically, the over-the-counter regimens are not indicated for colonoscopy prep but for issues of motility, such as constipation, but are still widely prescribed by physicians for colonoscopy prep. Depending on the insurance a patient has, the prescription prep may be covered in part but many of them require the patient to pay out-of-pocket.
 
The medical device and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have indirect competitors in a number of sectors, many of which have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Currently, the colonoscopy market is dominated by Olympus Corp, who controls a majority of the market, with Pentax Medical and FujiFilm Medical taking most of the rest of the U.S. colonoscope market. Boston Scientific, Medtronic GI Solutions, Conmed Corporation, Cantel Medical, Ambu A/S, and other smaller players sell ancillary devices and accessories into the marketplace as well. These established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel devices that could make our Pure-Vu System obsolete or uneconomical. There are also capsule endoscopy systems such as the PillCamTM from Medtronic and the Endocapsule 10 from Olympus Corp. These systems, however, require at least the same level of prep as conventional colonoscopies, cannot remove polyps, and therefore, cannot be used to obtain biopsies to detect cancer, so may be less useful for colonoscopy as compared to visualization of the small bowel. Another visualization technique is the virtual colonoscopy, where a radiologist uses a CT scan to obtain 2D and 3D images of the colon. Virtual colonoscopies may require the same level of prep as conventional colonoscopies and if a polyp or abnormality is detected, the patient may still need to undergo a colonoscopy. Other screening tests for colon cancer specifically include fecal occult blood tests and DNA stool tests such as the Cologuard test from Exact Sciences. However, Cologuard is not a replacement for diagnostic colonoscopies or surveillance colonoscopies in high-risk individuals and has a lower specificity than standard colonoscopies. While none of these testing alternatives may ever fully replace the colonoscopy, over time, they may take market share away from conventional colonoscopies for specific purposes and may lower the potential market opportunity for us.

Any new product that competes with an approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, cost, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. Other competitive factors, including new competitive entrants, could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to the Pure-Vu System. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.
 
Research and Development
 
We have research and development capabilities in electrical and mechanical engineering with laboratories in our facility in Israel for development and prototyping, and electronics design and testing. We also use consultants and third party design houses to complement our internal capabilities.
 
We have received, and may receive in the future, grants from the Government of the State of Israel through the Israeli National Authority for Technological Innovation (the “IIA”) (formerly known as the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Economy and Industry (the “OCS”)), for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures pursuant to the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in Industry 5744-1984 (the “Research Law”), and the regulations previously promulgated thereunder, as well as the IIA’s rules and benefit tracks which apply to companies receiving IIA funding (collectively, including the Research Law, the “IIA Regulations”).
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had received grants from the IIA in the aggregate amount of $1.332 million, and had a contingent obligation to the IIA up to an aggregate amount of approximately $1.407 million (assuming no increase, per the IIA Regulations, as described below). As of December 31, 2020, we paid a minimal amount to the IIA. We may apply for additional IIA grants in the future. However, as the funds available for IIA grants out of the annual budget of the State of Israel are subject to the pre-approval of the IIA and have been reduced in the past and may be further reduced in the future, we cannot predict whether we will be entitled to – or approved for – any future grants, or the amounts of any such grants (if approved).
 
In exchange for these grants, we are required to pay royalties to the IIA of 4% (which may be increased under certain circumstances) from our revenues generated (in any fashion) from know-how developed using IIA grants, up to an aggregate of 100% (which may be increased under certain circumstances) of the U.S. dollar-linked value of the grant, plus interest at the rate of 12-month LIBOR.
 
The IIA Regulations also require that products developed with IIA grants be manufactured in Israel at a rate (scope) which will not be less than the rate of manufacturing and added value in Israel that were included in the relevant grant applications submitted to the IIA. Furthermore, the IIA Regulations require that the know-how resulting from research and development according to an IIA-approved plan, not being the product developed within the framework of such approved plan, and any right deriving therefrom may not be transferred outside of Israel (including by way of certain licenses), unless prior approval is received from the IIA. We received a general approval for such transfer. The transfer outside of Israel of manufacturing which is connected with the IIA-funded knowhow at a greater scope than the scope set forth in the general approval will result in a higher royalty repayment rate and may further result in increased royalties (up to three times the aggregate amount of the IIA grants plus interest thereon). In addition, the transfer outside of Israel of IIA-funded knowhow may trigger additional payments to the IIA (up to six times the aggregate amount of the IIA grants plus interest thereon). Even following the full repayment of any IIA grants, we must nevertheless continue to comply with the requirements of the IIA Regulations. The foregoing restrictions and requirements for payment may impair our ability to transfer or sell our technology assets outside of Israel or to outsource or transfer development or manufacturing activities with respect to any IIA-funded know-how outside of Israel.
 
Furthermore, companies that receive IIA funding are generally required to ensure that all rights in the IIA-backed product are retained by them. This means that, generally, all know-how which is derived from the research and development conducted pursuant to an IIA approved plan, and every right derived from it, must be owned by the recipient of the IIA funding from the date such know-how is generated. Companies that receive IIA funding are further subject to reporting requirements and other technical requirements, which are intended to allow the IIA to ensure that the IIA Regulations are being complied with.
 
If we fail to comply with any of the conditions and restrictions imposed by the IIA Regulations, or by the specific terms under which we received the grants, we may be required to refund any grants previously received together with interest and penalties, and, in certain circumstances, may be subject to criminal charges.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
We have established relationships with research facilities, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and our collaborators to manufacture and supply our product for our initial U.S. market launch targeting early adopter hospitals and for our broader commercialization. Currently, the workstation and loading fixture component of our Pure-Vu System is manufactured by Sanmina Corporation at their facilities in Israel. We may enter into formal supply agreements for the manufacture of the workstation component and loading fixture of our Pure-Vu System with Sanmina Corporation as we continue to establish higher volume capabilities and our commercialization efforts grow. The disposable portion of our Pure-Vu System is manufactured by Polyzen, Inc., at their facilities in North Carolina, U.S., pursuant to a supply agreement we entered into with Polyzen, Inc. in September 2017. A critical component supplier for the disposable manufactured by Polyzen, Inc. is EG Gilero, at their facilities in China. These manufacturing suppliers have extensive experience in medical devices and dealing with regulatory bodies. These suppliers have ISO 13485 approved quality systems. We have an agreement in place with a third party logistics provider in the U.S. who is ISO 13485 certified and specializes in medical devices and equipment. They provide warehousing, shipping and back office support to meet our commercial needs.
 
For additional information, see “Part I—Item 1—Business—Research and Development” above, and “Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations in Israel.”
 
U.S. Market Entry Strategy
 
Our initial launch strategy in the United States is focused on the acute care hospital market. Our focus is on building clinical champions amongst key Gastroenterologists, and other GI and nursing floor leadership and staff. Additionally, we articulate the clinical and economic value of the Pure-Vu System technology to key members of hospital administration. After a pre-defined product evaluation period, we seek to work within the Value Analysis Committee approval process, currently utilized within most U.S. hospitals and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). Following successful implementation at the flagship location within an IDN, we then seek to gain further expansion of the Pure-Vu System within sister hospital locations. We support our customers with robust training on the effective use of our Pure-Vu System technology through our training and in-servicing programs.
 
In addition to working with a third-party logistics provider specializing in medical devices to provide front and back office support to successfully fulfill customer orders, our commercial organization has implemented a robust customer relationship management tool to track account progress and help provide accurate forecasting for operations. We anticipate the sales cycle to be in the range of six to twelve months. Our primary focus of the initial product launch is on gaining system placements in the acute care hospital market, driving utilization of our Pure-Vu System disposable sleeve, growing top line revenues and appropriately scaling the commercial organization.
 
Market Expansion Opportunities
 
Our resources are currently focused on the initial U.S. market launch targeting early adopter hospitals. However, we have identified several follow-on market expansion opportunities that are currently being evaluated, including the upper GI endoscopy and high medical need outpatient markets, as described below.
Upper GI Endoscopy Market
 
Upper GI bleeds occurred at a rate of approximately 400,000 cases per year in 2019 in the United States, according to iData Research Inc. The mortality rate of this condition can reach up to approximately 10%, as noted in Thad Wilkins, MD, et al., American Family Physician (2012).Removing adherent blood clots from the field of view is a significant need in allowing the physician the ability to find and treat the bleed. We believe the Pure-Vu System has the potential to be adapted and used during upper GI endoscopy procedures to remove clots and debris in order to provide a clear field of view for the endoscopist. This additional indication for the use of the Pure-Vu System would require a 510(k) clearance by the FDA.
High Medical Need Outpatient Market
 
The high medical need outpatient colonoscopy market presents a large potential commercial market opportunity for the Pure-Vu System. Based on our review and analysis of 2019 market data and 2021 projections for the U.S. and Europe, as obtained from iData Research Inc., and estimates from HRA Healthcare Research & Analytics - Market Research, May 2015, we believe there are ~4.7M high medical need outpatient colonoscopies performed in the US each year and ~11.7M worldwide. These colonoscopy patients can often times have an inadequate preparation, which may lead to repeat procedures earlier than the medical guidelines suggest. We believe use of the Pure-Vu System has the potential to reduce the need for such repeat procedures if used in the high medical need outpatient colonoscopy market. We may seek to obtain reimbursement coverage for this market through exploration of programs with both private and public payers focused on new technology platforms.

Additionally, if we choose to explore either market, we may be able to leverage our existing hospital and physician relationships developed through our inpatient colonoscopy sales force to facilitate such expansion.
 


Strategic Partnerships
 
We intend to explore potential strategic relationships to accelerate and scale our US commercialization effort, and to initiate sales in the EU, Japan, China and other markets in the future.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 24 full time employees. All of our employees are engaged in administration, finance, clinical, research and development, engineering, regulatory or sales and marketing functions. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We anticipate that the number of employees will grow as we scale our commercial capabilities. In addition, we utilize and will continue to utilize consultants, clinical research organizations and third parties to perform our pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, manufacturing and regulatory functions.
 
Under Israeli law, we and our employees in Israel are subject to Israeli protective labor provisions governing certain matters such as the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, annual leave, sick pay, determination of severance pay and advance notice of termination of employment, as well as the procedures for hiring and dismissing employees and equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws. While none of our employees in Israel is party to any collective bargaining agreements, expansion orders issued by the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry may make certain industry-wide collective bargaining agreements applicable to us. These agreements affect matters such as the length of the workday and week, recuperation pay, travel expenses and pension rights. We have never experienced labor-related work stoppages and believe that our good and positive relationships with our employees are a significant part of our operations.
 
Israeli law generally requires the payment of severance pay by employers upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee. We fund our ongoing Israeli severance obligations by making monthly payments to the employees’ respective insurance policies. All of our current employees in Israel have agreed, as part of their employment agreements, that, upon termination of their employment, they will be entitled to receive only the amounts accrued in the insurance policies with respect to severance pay.
 
Furthermore, Israeli employees and employers are required to pay predetermined sums to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. These amounts also include payments for national health insurance.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change, or new laws may be enacted.
 
Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulation of medical devices.
 
The FDCA and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Our products include medical devices that are subject to these, as well as other federal, state, local and foreign, laws and regulations. The FDA is responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations governing medical devices in the United States.
 
10

 

The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, Class II, or Class III) depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary to ensure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment is a factor in determining the type of premarketing submission or application, if any, that will be required before marketing in the United States.
 

● | Class I devices present a low risk and are not life-sustaining or life-supporting. The majority of Class I devices are subject only to “general controls” (e.g., prohibition against adulteration and misbranding, registration and listing, good manufacturing practices, labeling, and adverse event reporting. General controls are baseline requirements that apply to all classes of medical devices.) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class II devices present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and “special controls” (e.g., special labeling, compliance with performance standards, and post market surveillance. Unless exempted, Class II devices typically require FDA clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification (510(k)) process.) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III devices present the highest risk. These devices generally are life-sustaining, life-supporting, or for a use that is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Class III devices are devices for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient and for which there is insufficient information to determine that application of special controls would provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are subject to general controls and typically require FDA approval of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application before marketing. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements, a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially marketed, distributed or sold in the United States. The most common pathways for obtaining marketing authorization are 510(k) clearance and PMA.
 
510(k) pathway
 
The 510(k) review process compares a new device to a legally marketed device. Through the 510(k) process, the FDA determines whether a new medical device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device (i.e., predicate device) that is not subject to PMA requirements. “Substantial equivalence” means that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and the same or similar technological characteristics, or if there are differences in technological characteristics, the differences do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate, and the information submitted in the 510(k) demonstrates that the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device.
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a 510(k) application containing sufficient information and data to demonstrate that its proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. These data generally include non-clinical performance testing (e.g., software validation, animal testing electrical safety testing), but may also include clinical data. Typically, it takes three to twelve months for the FDA to complete its review of a 510(k) submission; however, it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. During its review of a 510(k), the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After completing its review of a 510(k), the FDA may issue an order, in the form of a letter, that finds the device to be either (i) substantially equivalent and states that the device can be marketed in the United States, or (ii) not substantially equivalent and states that device cannot be marketed in the United States. Depending upon the reasons for the not substantially equivalent finding, the device may need to be approved through the PMA pathway (discussed below) prior to commercialization.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, including significant modifications to any of our products or procedures, requires submission and clearance of a new 510(k) or approval of a PMA. The FDA relies on each manufacturer to make and document this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Modifications meeting certain conditions may be candidates for a streamlined FDA review known as Special 510(k) review, which the FDA intends to process within 30 days of receipt. If a device modification requires the submission of a 510(k), but the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or alter the fundamental technology of the device, then summary information that results from the design control process associated with the cleared device can serve as the basis for clearing the application. A Special 510(k) allows a manufacturer to declare conformance to design controls without providing new data. When a modification involves a change in material, the nature of the “new” material will determine whether a traditional or Special 510(k) is necessary. An Abbreviated 510(k) is another type of 510(k) that is intended to streamline the review of data through the reliance on one or more FDA-recognized consensus standards, special controls established by regulation, or FDA guidance documents. In most cases, an Abbreviated 510(k) includes one or more declarations of conformity to an FDA-recognized consensus standard. We may also make minor product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances. If the FDA disagrees with our determination regarding whether a new 510(k) clearance was required for these modifications, we may need to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device. The FDA may also subject us to other enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, issuing a warning letter or untitled letter to us, seizing our products, imposing civil penalties, or initiating criminal prosecution.

Premarket approval pathway
 
Unlike the comparative standard of the 510(k) pathway, the PMA approval process requires an independent demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of a device. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. PMA approval is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to ensure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). A PMA application generally includes extensive information about the device including the results of clinical testing conducted on the device and a detailed description of the manufacturing process.
 
After a PMA application is accepted for review, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. FDA regulations provide 180 days to review the PMA and make a determination; however, in reality, the review time is normally longer (e.g., 1-3 years). During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the data supporting the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to whether the data provide a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with QSR, which imposes comprehensive development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements for the design and manufacturing of a medical device.
 
Based on its review, the FDA may (i) issue an order approving the PMA, (ii) issue a letter stating the PMA is “approvable” (e.g., minor additional information is needed), (iii) issue a letter stating the PMA is “not approvable,” or (iv) issue an order denying PMA. A company may not market a device subject to PMA review until the FDA issues an order approving the PMA. As part of a PMA approval, the FDA may impose post-approval conditions intended to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and requiring the collection of additional clinical data. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
 
Most modifications to a PMA approved device, including changes to the design, labeling, or manufacturing process, require prior approval before being implemented. Prior approval is obtained through submission of a PMA supplement. The type of information required to support a PMA supplement and the FDA’s time for review of a PMA supplement vary depending on the nature of the modification.
 
Clinical trials
 
Clinical trials of medical devices in the United States are governed by the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulation. This regulation places significant responsibility on the sponsor of the clinical study including, but not limited to, choosing qualified investigators, monitoring the trial, submitting required reports, maintaining required records, and assuring investigators obtain informed consent, comply with the study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, submit required reports, etc.
 
Clinical trials of significant risk devices (e.g., implants, devices used in supporting or sustaining human life, devices of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health) require FDA and Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval prior to starting the trial. FDA approval is obtained through submission of an IDE application. Clinical trials of non-significant risk (“NSR”), devices (i.e., devices that do not meet the regulatory definition of a significant risk device) only require IRB approval before starting. The clinical trial sponsor is responsible for making the initial determination of whether a clinical study is significant risk or NSR; however, a reviewing IRB and/or FDA may review this decision and disagree with the determination.
 
12

 

An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as performance data, animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the clinical study protocol is scientifically sound. There is no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
As noted above, the FDA may require a company to collect clinical data on a device in the post-market setting.
 
The collection of such data may be required as a condition of PMA approval. The FDA also has the authority to order, via a letter, a post-market surveillance study for certain devices at any time after they have been cleared or approved.
 
Similar requirements may be applicable in other countries and jurisdictions including the European Union, the European Economic Area, and the United Kingdom.
 
Pervasive and continuing FDA regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally apply. These include, but are not limited to:
 

● | Establishment registration and device listing requirements; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Labeling requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling, and generally require the label and package of medical devices to include a unique device identifier (“UDI”), and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., “off-label,” uses; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; manufacturers and importers must keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions:
 

● | Untitled letters or warning letters; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Fines, injunctions and civil penalties; 
● | Recall or seizure of our products; 
● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | Refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products; 
● | Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and 
● | Criminal prosecution.

We are subject to either announced or unannounced device inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.
 
International
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. Medical device manufacturers intending to market medical devices in the European Union/ and the European Economic Area (the “EU/EEA”), are required to affix the CE Mark to their medical devices, often after the intervention of a notified body and the issuing of a CE Certificate of Conformity. Many other countries, such as Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, accept CE Certificates of Conformity or FDA clearance or approval, although others, such as Brazil, Canada and Japan require separate regulatory filings.
 
In the EU and the EEA, medical devices are currently required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements would entitle us to affix the CE mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EU and EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE mark we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which procedure varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Apart from low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization accredited by an EU Member States’ accreditation body to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our medical devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity. After receiving the CE Certificate of Conformity from the Notified Body we can draw up a CE Declaration of Conformity which allows us to affix the CE Mark to our products.

After receiving the CE Certificate of Conformity from the notified body we can draw up a CE Declaration of Conformity which allows us to affix the CE Mark to our products.
 
Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EU and the EEA is subject to the laws of individual EU and EEA Member States implementing the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU and EEA Member State laws and industry codes governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 
On May 26, 2021, the EU Medical Devices Regulation will become applicable which will repeal the EU Medical Devices Directive. Notified bodies will have to be accredited by the EU Member States’ accreditation bodies to conduct assessment procedures for medical devices. There are currently a relatively small number of notified bodies that have been accredited to conduct conformity assessment to the Regulation. This may delay our conformity assessment procedures in the future. The Medical Devices Regulation imposes a number of new requirements on manufacturers of medical devices. This may have also impact our activities in the EU, the EEA and the UK, the renewal of our existing CE Certificates of Conformity and conformity assessment related to future bodies.

On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, commonly referred to as Brexit. The United Kingdom and EU have now agreed on the terms of the exit deal, which will include a transitional period following the United Kingdom’s exit which occurred on January 31, 2020. The transitional period will continue until December 31, 2020 during which the EU and the United Kingdom will seek to negotiate new arrangements for the period from January 1, 2021. During the transitional period most obligations imposed by EU legislation will remain applicable to and in the United Kingdom. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations, the “hard” withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU (where no deal is agreed for the period after the transitional period ending December 31, 2020) could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to our CE Certificates of Conformity in the United Kingdom. CE Certificates of Conformity issued by a notified body accredited in the EU may no longer by recognized in the UK. Similarly, notified bodies accredited in the UK will no longer be able to issue CE Certificates of Conformity. Obtaining new CE Certificates of Conformity or certification for the UK may have a significant impact on our activities.
 
Other Regulatory Matters
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The distribution of medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of medical device products.
 
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Our Pure-Vu System and the procedure to cleanse the colon in preparation for colonoscopy are not currently separately reimbursable through private or governmental third-party payors in any country. Significant uncertainty exists as to whether coverage and separate reimbursement of the Pure-Vu System will develop; but we intend to seek separate reimbursement through private or governmental third-party payors in the future. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize the Pure-Vu System successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for the Pure-Vu System, depends in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the CMS, through local contractors that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured, and it is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations or other guidelines that govern its individual program. Each payor, whether governmental or private, has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable Medicare coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of the Pure-Vu System will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such product and for the procedures in which such product is used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for the Pure-Vu System can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors.
 
In the event we do receive approval for third-party or government reimbursement for our product, the marketability of such product may suffer if the government and commercial third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect it will continue. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
15

 

State and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a medical device must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing medical device pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medical devices for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medical devices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of any of our medical devices to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be priced significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if reimbursement of our medical devices is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues from sales by us or our strategic partners and the potential profitability of any of our medical devices in those countries would be negatively affected.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and use of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers and physicians will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any device for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) makes it illegal for any person, including a device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward, or in return for, the purchase, lease, recommendation, order, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order, of any health care product or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Violations of this law are punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting from prosecution some common activities like discounts, or engaging health care professionals as speakers or consults; however, those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and there is no exception or safe harbor for many common business activities like educational grants or reimbursement support programs. In November 2020, the federal government finalized a regulation creating new safe harbors for, among other things, certain value-based arrangements and patient engagement tools, and that modifying and clarifying the scope of existing safe harbors for warranties and personal service agreements. The Biden Administration has temporarily paused implementation of the final rule. Whether the rule will go into effect and the impact of the regulation on our current or contemplated operations remains to be seen.

● | The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant mandatory penalties per false claim or statement for violations for each separate false claim, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act also may implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also are deemed false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.

● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”) imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers; knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program; willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain obligations, including contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.

● | HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA privacy and security rules and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. On December 12, 2018, HHS issued a request for information (RFI) seeking input from the public on how the HIPAA regulations, and the Privacy Rule in particular, could be modified to amend existing, or impose additional, obligations relating to the processing of PHI. Subsequent to the RFI, on January 21, 2021, HHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) containing potential modifications to the Privacy Rule addressing standards that may impede the transition to value-based health care. The Company is monitoring the NPRM process. If modifications to the Privacy Rule are adopted, they may impact the Company’s compliance obligations under HIPAA

● | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which requires that certain manufacturers of devices and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.

● | Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, and state and local laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to health care providers and state and local laws that require manufacturers to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. State laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions.

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, which are applicable to “business associates”—certain persons or entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a specified service or performing a function on behalf of a covered entity.
 
Further, the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data security issues with the potential to affect our business. Congress and state legislatures also have been considering and enacting new legislation relating to privacy and data protection. For example, on June 28, 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA created new transparency requirements and granted California residents several new rights with regard their personal information. In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”). The amendments introduced by the CPRA go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. We implemented processes to manage compliance with the CCPA and continues to assess the impact of the CPRA, and other state legislation, on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available.

EU Member States and other jurisdictions where we operate have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the EU Data Protection Directive, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical investigations and safety reporting.
 
Switzerland has adopted similar restrictions. These obligations and restrictions concern, in particular, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relate, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA or Switzerland, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, as well as substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations.

Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the GDPR and applicable related national laws differently and impose requirements additional to those provided in the GDPR. In addition, guidance on implementation and compliance practices may be updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. When processing personal data of subjects in the EU, we must comply with the applicable data protection laws. In particular, when we rely on third party services providers processing personal data of subjects in the EU we must enter into suitable agreements with these providers and receive sufficient guarantees that the providers meet the requirements of the applicable data protection laws, particularly the GDPR which imposes specific and relevant obligations.
 
Although there are legal mechanisms to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the US, decisions of the European Court of Justice have increased uncertainty around compliance with EU privacy law requirements. As a result of the decision in the Schrems case (Case C-362/14 Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner), it was no longer possible to rely on the safe harbor certification as a legal basis for the transfer of personal data from the EU to entities in the US. On February 29, 2016,, the European Commission announced an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce (DOC) to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework with a new EU-US “Privacy Shield.” However, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-US Privacy Shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism, confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and left unaddressed some issues regarding supplementary measures that may need to be taken to support transfers. As a result, organizations are no longer able to use the Privacy Shield framework to transfer personal data.
 
Adherence to the Privacy Shield is not, however, mandatory. US-based companies are permitted to rely on other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the GDPR. If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA or Switzerland to the US (or other countries not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection) are not considered adequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results.
 
Current and future legislation
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.

For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) was enacted. The Affordable Care Act has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and has significantly affected the health care industry. Certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation and implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) enacted on December 22, 2017, included a provision that eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under Section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible, but the nature and extent of such potential changes or challenges are uncertain at this time. The implications of the Affordable Care Act, and efforts to repeal, replace, or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the Affordable Care Act or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, or the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal, replacement, or other modification to the Affordable Care Act for our business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act as well as its possible repeal, replacement, modification, or invalidation, in whole or in part, has on our business.
 
Additional laws and regulations governing international operations
 
If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate, or to any employee of a public international organization, for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
 
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and resource-intensive, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. We may become involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
 
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
 
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.
 
Our business activities outside of the U.S. are also subject to anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.
 
Interactions between medical devices manufacturers and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct developed at both EU level and in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medical devices is prohibited in the EU. Breach of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, their competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.

Post-Marketing Regulations
 
Following clearance or approval of a new product, a company and the product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other foreign, federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting for uses or in patient populations not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators or subject of review by a notified body in the EU, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and, for as long as we continue to be an “emerging growth company,” we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an “emerging growth company” for up to five years from the date of our initial public offering in February 2018, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions described above until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” Under the JOBS Act, “emerging growth companies” can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.”
