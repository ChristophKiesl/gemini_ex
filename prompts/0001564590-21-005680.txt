 We sell our entire product offering and full line of services in most regions of the world. Moreover, we report under a geographic reporting structure to better align with the location of our customers and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The main products we sell are:   
 Lattice-boom crawler cranes. Under the Manitowoc brand name, we design, manufacture, market and sell lattice-boom crawler cranes. Lattice-boom crawler cranes weigh less and provide higher lifting capacities than a mobile telescopic crane of similar boom length. The lattice-boom crawler cranes are the only category of crane that can pick and move simultaneously with a full-rated load. The lattice-boom sections, together with the crane base, are transported to and erected at a project site. We offer our lattice-boom crawler crane customers various attachments that provide our cranes with greater capacity in terms of height, movement and lifting.

These cranes are used to lift material and equipment in a wide variety of applications, including heavy construction, bridge and highway, infrastructure and energy-related projects. These cranes are also used by the value-added crane rental industry, which serves all the aforementioned end markets. Lattice boom crawler cranes are produced in the U.S.
 Tower cranes. Under the Potain brand name, we design, manufacture, market, rent and sell tower cranes primarily used in the commercial and residential construction end markets. Tower cranes offer the ability to lift and distribute material at the point of use, more quickly and accurately than other types of lifting machinery, without utilizing substantial square footage on the ground. We offer a complete line of tower crane products, including top slewing, luffing jib, topless, self-erecting and special cranes for large building projects. 
 Top-slewing tower cranes are the most traditional form of tower cranes and have a tower and multi-sectioned horizontal jib. These cranes rotate from the top of their mast and can increase in height with the project. These cranes are generally sold to medium to large building and construction groups, as well as to rental companies. There are three styles of Top-Slewing Tower Cranes:  Hammerhead/cathead; Topless; and Luffing Jib. These cranes are produced in France, Portugal, India and China.
 Self-erecting tower cranes are bottom-slewing cranes which have a counterweight located at the bottom of the mast and are able to be erected, used and dismantled on job sites without assist cranes. Self-erecting tower cranes are mounted on axles or transported on a trailer. The lower segment of the range unfolds in four sections, two for the mast and two for the jib. Self-erecting cranes rotate from the bottom of their mast and are utilized primarily in low to medium rise construction and residential applications. Self-erecting tower cranes are produced in France and Italy.
 Mobile hydraulic cranes. Under the Grove, Shuttlelift and National Crane brand names, we design, manufacture, market and sell mobile hydraulic cranes utilized in industrial, commercial, construction and maintenance applications. Mobile hydraulic cranes consist of a telescopic boom mounted on a carrier with the ability to easily move in or between job sites, with some permitted on public roadways. We currently offer the following six types of mobile hydraulic cranes: rough-terrain, all-terrain, truck-mounted, telescopic crawler, industrial and boom truck.
 Rough-terrain cranes are designed to lift materials and equipment on rough or uneven terrain, and their versatility allows them to carry out many different lifts within the boundaries of given sites. These cranes cannot be driven on public roadways, and, accordingly, must be transported by truck to a job site. Rough-terrain cranes are produced in the U.S. and Italy and sold under the Grove brand name.
 All-terrain cranes are versatile cranes designed to perform a wide range of lifts on rough or uneven terrain. These cranes are highly maneuverable and roadable at highway speeds. All-terrain cranes are produced in Germany and sold under the Grove brand name.
 Truck-mounted cranes provide simple set-up, long reach, high capacity booms and are roadable at highway speeds. These cranes are produced in the U.S and sold under the Grove brand name. 
 Telescopic crawler cranes consist of a telescopic boom superstructure mounted on a crawler crane chassis. These cranes are purchased as complete units from a strategic manufacturing partner and sold under the Grove brand name. 
 Industrial cranes are designed primarily for plant maintenance, storage yard and material handling applications. These cranes allow for lifting and carrying loads on a smooth, flat surface. These cranes are manufactured in the U.S. and sold under the Grove and Shuttlelift brand names.
 We offer our hydraulic boom truck products under the National Crane brand name. A boom truck is a hydraulically powered telescopic crane mounted on a conventional truck chassis. Hydraulic boom trucks are used primarily for lifting material on a job site. These cranes are produced in the U.S.
 Customers. We did not have any customers that individually comprise more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Manufacturing
 We operate ten manufacturing facilities (including remanufacturing facilities) that utilize a variety of processes. In general, the manufacturing process involves the fabrication and machining of raw materials, primarily steel, which are then manufactured into sub-assemblies. Sub-assemblies are then assembled with purchased components into a complete machine. In our manufacturing operations, we maintain advanced manufacturing, quality assurance and testing equipment and utilize extensive process automation. We have also invested in Product Verification Centers at our major manufacturing facilities to support new product development, testing and qualification of sub-systems and final product designs.
 We train employees dedicated to leading the implementation of The Manitowoc Way, a business system that seeks to enhance customers' experiences with our products and services. Our team is comprised of individuals with diverse backgrounds in operations, quality, lean principles, finance, product and process engineering. The Manitowoc Way includes lean tools to eliminate waste from processes to provide better value for customers, and is used to assess customer satisfaction and implements measures to improve the customer experience. The Manitowoc Way improvement projects have contributed to manufacturing efficiency gains, materials management improvements, steady quality improvements and reduction of lead times, as well as enabling us to free up manufacturing space.
 Raw Materials and Supplies
 We purchase a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. Our primary raw materials are structural and rolled steel, which are purchased from various suppliers from around the world. We also purchase engines and electrical equipment and other semi- and fully-processed materials. Our policy is to maintain alternate sources of supply for our critical materials and parts wherever possible, and by doing so, we mitigate the risk of being dependent on a single source for any particular raw material or supply.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
 We utilize patent rights to protect our intellectual property and our position as a leading provider of engineered lift solutions. We hold numerous patents across the world pertaining to our products and also have pending applications for additional patents. In addition, we have various registered and unregistered trademarks, copyrights and licenses. We believe our patents, trademarks and copyrights are adequately protected in customary fashions under applicable laws. We actively enforce our patents, trademarks and copyrights.
Seasonality
 Our first quarter is typically the slowest quarter of the year due to seasonal conditions in the northern hemisphere impacting customer buying behavior.
 Competition
 We sell our products in highly competitive end markets. We compete in each of our end markets based on product design, quality of products, aftermarket support services, product performance, maintenance costs, energy and resource savings and other contributions to sustainability and price. Given the expense operational disruption can cause, our customers generally view quality and reliability as critical factors in their purchasing decision. We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages which create customer loyalty: strong brand names with competitive resale values, a reputation for quality and reliable products and aftermarket support and solution services, an established network of global distributors and customer relationships, broad product line offerings in the markets we serve and a commitment to customer-focused engineering design and product innovation.

Closely managed relationships with dealers, distributors and end users help us identify their needs, not only for products, but for the service and support that are critical to their profitable operations. As part of our ongoing commitment to provide superior products, we intend to continue our efforts to design products that meet evolving customer demands and reduce the period from product conception to product introduction.
 Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,200 people worldwide, of which approximately 1,200 were employed in the United States and 3,000 were employed outside the United States. A large majority of our European employees belong to various European trade unions. Additionally, we have one trade union in China and one trade union in India. We have no trade unions in North America. 
 Health and Safety: The health and safety of our employees is our number one priority. To track the health and safety performance across our global manufacturing locations we utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators.  The two lagging indicators we focus on is the Recordable Injury Rate (“RIR”) and Loss Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIF”).  These are calculated in line with the United States Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards.  In 2020, our year end RIR was 1.34 whereas the industry average was 4.1 and our LTIF stood at 0.87 versus the industry average of 0.9.  In 2020, we recorded zero fatalities within our operations. In addition to our focus on lagging indicators, we also have developed pro-active programs to track our leading indicators. Our leading indicators include reporting of “near misses” and daily hazard observations through our “SLAM” (Stop-Look-Assess-Manage) and “Interactive Observation” Programs. In 2020, we recorded 26,975 SLAMs and Interactive Observations which had a positive effect on our RIR and LTIF helping our workforce to identify hazards and implement mitigation measures to avoid injury or loss.
 Diversity: We strive to create diverse and inclusive workplaces where all our team members can perform to their full potential. We place particular emphasis on developing our people and building a deep and diverse talent pool to ensure Manitowoc’s sustained success over the long-term. As stewards of our diversity and inclusion initiatives, our leadership team takes a proactive approach to build and develop a diverse pipeline of talent. Formed in 2019, the Future Leader Mentoring Program is an 18-month program partnering our key talent with executive leadership, to develop talent and identify our future leaders from within the enterprise. The first wave of this program was designed to accelerate the development of female leaders in the organization, increase retention, and create a strong pool of talent to take on more prominent roles in the future.
 Training and Talent Development: We provide all Manitowoc employees with a wide range of professional development opportunities throughout their careers.  Programs designed to help our employees effectively perform their duties include our training courses in: environmental health and safety, welding apprenticeships, sales skills development, Lean manufacturing methodologies, The Manitowoc Way and corporate compliance (ethics & code of conduct, diversity & inclusion, insider training and workplace harassment).  The Company also provides tuition reimbursement and routinely invests in seminars, conferences, and other training or continuing education for our employees.  Additionally, the CEO and EVP, Human Resources conduct annual global succession planning meetings with senior leadership and the board of directors to review the Company’s top talent.  We have implemented several programs to support the ongoing development of the Company’s top talent including: a mentorship program which includes a focus on developing female leaders, a supervisor leadership development program and ongoing individual development programs designed to build the leadership capabilities of our existing and future leaders.
