Item 1.  Business
Company Overview
 We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 50 year history, we have built a diversified portfolio of 12 destination and regional theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States, many of which showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. Our theme parks feature a diverse array of rides, shows and other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests.
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we hosted approximately 22.0 million guests in our theme parks, including approximately 2.9 million international guests. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we had total revenues of $1.34 billion and generated a net loss of $12.5 million.
 We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other spending. For the year ended December 31, 2016, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenue, and food, merchandise and other revenue accounted for approximately 39% of our total revenue. Over the same period of time, we reported $37.17 in admission per capita (calculated as admissions revenue divided by total attendance) and $23.93 in-park per capita spending (calculated as food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance).
 In November 2015, we communicated our roadmap to stabilize our business to drive sustainable growth.  This strategic plan encompasses five key points which include (i) providing experiences that matter; (ii) delivering distinct guest experiences that are fun and meaningful; (iii) pursuing organic and strategic revenue growth; (iv) addressing the challenges we face; and (v) financial discipline.  The plan is intended to build on our strong business fundamentals by evolving the guest experience to align with consumer preferences for experiences that matter.  Through family entertainment and distinct experiences and attractions, we provide our guests an opportunity to explore and learn more about the natural world and the plight of animals in the wild, to be inspired and to act to make a better world. The plan includes a new approach to in-park activities as well as “turning parks inside out” by taking our guests behind the scenes to provide a better understanding of our veterinary care and animal rescue operations. Other elements of the plan include implementing a simplified pricing model, targeted capital investments in new attractions across our parks, and an ongoing focus on cost control as part of a larger commitment to overall financial discipline.  Additionally, we announced a new resort strategy that will include evaluating opportunities which could include purchasing or developing resort properties in or near some of our parks.  We also recently announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi (see the “International Development Strategy” section which follows).
 On March 17, 2016, we announced that we have ended all orca breeding and the orcas currently in our care will be the last generation of orcas at SeaWorld (the “Orca Announcement”).  We also announced that we will introduce new, inspiring, natural orca encounters and phase out our current theatrical shows, as part of our ongoing commitment to education, marine science research, and rescue of marine animals. These programs will focus on orca enrichment, exercise, and overall health. This change will start in our SeaWorld San Diego park in 2017, and will be at all three SeaWorld parks by 2019. In conjunction with the Orca Announcement, the orca habitat expansion we previously disclosed (the “Blue World Project”), as originally designed and planned, will not move forward and we will spend significantly less capital than the originally proposed Blue World Project.  The “new” SeaWorld will maintain our unique value proposition of providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  We have implemented an integrated marketing plan designed to attract new and repeat guests to the “new” SeaWorld with its unique blend of compelling animal experiences and new rides and attractions for the whole family.  See the “Capital Improvements” section which follows for a discussion of new rides and attractions.
 As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Our Animals” and “—Philanthropy and Community Relations” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Recent Developments
 Potential Debt Refinancing Transaction
 We are currently exploring a potential refinancing of our existing senior secured credit facilities in order to improve our capital structure by extending maturities and improving certain other terms of our debt. The debt refinancing will be subject to certain customary closing conditions and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing the refinancing on any particular terms or at all.

Restructuring Program
 On December 6, 2016, we committed to and implemented a restructuring program in an effort to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, reduce duplication of functions and improve the Company’s operations (the “2016 Restructuring Program”). The 2016 Restructuring Program is part of our previously announced comprehensive cost optimization program that is expected to reduce costs by approximately $65.0 million, with a targeted $40.0 million in net savings by the end of 2018. The 2016 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 320 positions by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 across our twelve theme parks and our headquarters. As a result, we recorded approximately $8.9 million in pre-tax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to severance and other related expenses incurred in connection with the 2016 Restructuring Program. See Note 4–Restructuring Programs and Separation Costs to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
International Development Strategy
 We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We assess these opportunities while maintaining a conservative and disciplined approach towards the execution of our international development strategy.  We have identified certain international market priorities as well as identified certain international partners within such markets for prioritization of our resources. The market priorities were developed based on a specific set of criteria to ensure we expand our brands into the most attractive markets. 
 On December 13, 2016, we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”).   As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses.  As of December 31, 2016, we have received a nonrefundable payment of $10.0 million from our partner in consideration of the design and planning services described above which is recorded as deferred revenue in other liabilities and have incurred approximately $2.8 million of deferred costs which is recorded in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. On November 3, 2016, the definitive documents related to the Middle East Project were finalized and executed by the parties.  
 This next generation SeaWorld Abu Dhabi will also introduce the United Arab Emirates’ (“UAE”) first dedicated marine life research, rescue rehabilitation and return center with world-class facilities and resources for the care and conservation of local marine life.  Planned to open ahead of the marine life themed park, the facility will provide an important resource for UAE nationals and residents looking to develop or enhance expertise in marine life sciences and will serve as a hub for collaboration with local and international environmental organizations and projects.  
 SeaWorld Abu Dhabi will be the first new SeaWorld without orcas, and will integrate up-close animal experiences, mega attractions and a world class aquarium, bringing the latest technology in visitor engagement.  SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is expected to open by 2022.  The Middle East Project is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the parties completing the design development and there is no assurance that the Middle East Project will be completed or advance to the next stage.
 For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of acquisitions or other strategic initiatives.”
 Dividend Policy
 In September 2016, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) suspended the Company’s quarterly dividend to allow the Company greater flexibility to deploy capital, when possible, to opportunities that offer the greatest long term returns to shareholders, such as, but not limited to, investments in new attractions, debt repayments or share repurchases.  Future dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon, among other things, the Company’s financial condition, capital needs, covenants, economic conditions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant.  
Other Matters
 In March 2016, we converted Aquatica San Antonio into a stand-alone, separate admission park that guests can access through an independent gate without the need to purchase admission to SeaWorld San Antonio.  Prior to 2016, Aquatica San Antonio was only accessible to SeaWorld San Antonio guests for an additional fee. This separate gate has provided incremental attendance; however, we have also seen a shift in guests from SeaWorld San Antonio to Aquatica San Antonio. Total combined attendance at our Texas park locations increased by approximately 330,000 guests in 2016 when compared to 2015.

On February 22, 2016, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2016, which was paid on April 1, 2016.  Based on this dividend payment, certain performance-vesting restricted shares originally granted on or before our initial public offering in 2013 (the “2.25x Performance Restricted shares”) held by some of our equity plan participants vested on April 1, 2016.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $27.5 million of total equity compensation expense (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and in operating expenses) and recorded approximately $3.4 million of accumulated dividends related to these 2.25x Performance Restricted shares.  See Note 18–Equity-Based Compensation in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 During the first quarter of 2016, we removed deep-water lifting floors from the orca habitats at each of our three SeaWorld-branded theme parks.  The deep-water lifting floors were intended as another safety tool for conducting in-water training in the deeper pools. The lifting floors located in the medical pools, where our orca in-water training currently takes place, were not affected. That training will continue as an essential part of our overall safety program.  Having safely and successfully conducted in-water training in the medical pools for almost 4 years, our safety and zoological professionals determined that the deep-water lifting floors in the deeper pools were no longer needed. This change provides more space for the animals, and increases the time that the deep-water pool is available by eliminating downtime for maintenance and cleaning. As a result, during the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $33.7 million of accelerated depreciation related to the disposal of these lifting floors, which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also recorded approximately $6.4 million in asset write-offs associated with the canceled Blue World Project.
 Regulatory Developments 
 On July 16, 2015, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) offered an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2016 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies spending bill during consideration of the bill by the full Committee on Appropriations. The amendment directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) to issue updated regulations for the display of marine mammals in domestic zoos and aquaria within six months of enactment. While that amendment was not included in the final Fiscal Year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Bill, APHIS released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”).  The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016.  We submitted a comment letter to APHIS on the final date for comments, expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations.  The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized.
 On October 8, 2015, the California Coastal Commission approved our plan to build a new killer whale habitat (the “Blue World Project”) in San Diego. On October 8, 2015, the California Coastal Commission approved the Blue World Project in San Diego, but attached certain conditions to its approval. Those conditions included, among other things, a prohibition against breeding orcas or transporting orcas to or from the habitat. On December 29, 2015, we filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission on the grounds that the California Coastal Commission decision was outside the scope of its authority in imposing such conditions because it does not have jurisdiction over orcas, which are regulated under federal law.  As a result of the Orca Announcement, on April 18, 2016, we sent a letter to the California Coastal Commission requesting to formally withdraw our coastal development permit application for the Blue World Project habitat and discuss dismissal of the pending litigation since our legal challenge to the proposed conditions is no longer warranted. On July 27, 2016, we filed a request for dismissal to dismiss our lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission.  On October 17, 2016, we sent a letter to the California Coastal Commission objecting to the approval of the proposed revised findings for the Blue World Project.  We stated that the adoption of revised findings was not warranted or needed because of the Orca Announcement and recent changes in California law.  On November 4, 2016 the California Coastal Commission voted in the affirmative to reverse findings on the Blue World Project.
 On November 16, 2015, Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement Act (the “ORCA Act”). The bill has been referred to the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees. It is unclear whether this bill will be enacted into law, but if enacted, this bill would amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of orcas for the purposes of public display.   
 5

On August 26, 2016, following the Orca Announcement, the California Orca Protection Act was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California. As discussed above, the new orca programs we are developing will be consistent with these standards and begin in our San Diego park in 2017 with our other SeaWorld parks following by 2019.  On November 4, 2016, the California Coastal Commission granted approval to permit the renovation of the existing backdrop at the orca habitat at our San Diego park.  This approval allows us to continue to develop our new orca program in our San Diego park.
 For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts.”
 On February 8, 2016, the San Diego City Council decided to put a proposal on the June 7, 2016 primary ballot for voters to decide whether the city of San Diego should have a higher minimum wage than the $10 per hour required by the State of California. The proposal was approved by San Diego voters and, beginning on July 11, 2016, the city’s minimum wage was increased to $10.50 and, beginning on January 1, 2017, was increased again to $11.50. Two years later in January 2019, annual increases to the San Diego minimum wage as well as the State of California minimum wage based on the consumer price index will start to be implemented. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the San Diego minimum wage and State of California minimum wage increases, see “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.”   
 Our Competitive Strengths
  
• | Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands and intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various media and consumer product offerings, including websites, advertisements and media programming, toys, books, apparel and technology accessories. For example, we have developed iPhone and Android smartphone applications for our SeaWorld, Busch Gardens and Sesame Place theme parks, which offer GPS navigation through the theme parks and interactive theme park maps that show the nearest dining locations, gift shops and ATMs and provide real-time updates on wait times for rides.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have also leveraged our brands into media, entertainment and consumer products.  We produce two educational and entertaining television shows that highlight our rescue and rehabilitation and animal care efforts, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs.  In 2016, both Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs were nominated for the Daytime Emmy® Award in the category of Outstanding Children’s Series by the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. In 2016, Sea Rescue won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children’s Series.  In 2015, both Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs were each presented with a silver honor from the Parents' Choice Award®, a nonprofit program created to recognize quality children’s media.  Sea Rescue is a Saturday morning television show airing on the ABC Network featuring our ongoing work to rescue injured animals in coordination with various government agencies and other rescue organizations. The Wildlife Docs, which also airs on the ABC Network on Saturday mornings, centers on the day-to-day activities at our Animal Care Center at Busch Gardens Tampa.  
  
• | Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks, including four of the top 20 theme parks and three of the top 10 water parks in North America as measured by attendance, according to the TEA/AECOM Report. Our theme parks are beautifully themed and deliver high-quality entertainment, aesthetic appeal, shopping and dining and have won numerous awards, including the Amusement Today Golden Ticket Award for Best Landscaping. Our theme parks feature six of the 50 highest rated steel roller coasters in the world, led by Apollo’s Chariot, the #6 rated steel roller coaster in the world according to the 2016 Amusement Today Annual Survey, and have won the top three spots in the Amusement Today annual Golden Ticket Award for Best Marine Life Park since the award’s inception in 2006 through 2016. In fact, in 2016, we had four of our theme parks in the top five spots for Best Marine Life Park and in 2015, we won the top four spots. We have over 600 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 91 animal habitats, 117 shows and 197 rides. In addition, we have over 400 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from emotional and educational animal encounters to thrilling rides and exciting shows. As a result of these distinctive offerings, our guest surveys routinely report very high “Overall Satisfaction” scores, with 96% of respondents in 2016 ranking their experience good or excellent.

• | Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which helps protect us from the impact of localized events. Each theme park showcases a different mix of zoological, thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions. This varied portfolio of entertainment offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base while allowing us to benefit from improvements in macroeconomic conditions, including increased consumer spending and international travel.

• | One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our ability to present our animals in a differentiated and interactive manner. We believe we have one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We have the largest group of killer whales, also known as orcas, in human care. We have not collected a killer whale from the wild in almost 40 years. More than 80% of our marine mammals were born in human care. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our more than five decades of caring for animals, would be very difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “Capital Improvements” section which follows for a discussion of new rides and attractions). The limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, led by Joel Manby, our President and Chief Executive Officer, includes some of the most experienced theme park executives in the world, with an average tenure of approximately 19 years in the industry, as of December 31, 2016. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product development, business development, marketing and finance. In addition, we are one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations with more than 1,500 employees dedicated to animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and travel packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Cash Flow Generation. Our disciplined approach to capital expenditures and working capital management enables us to generate strong and recurring cash flow. Five of our 12 theme parks are open year-round, reducing our seasonal cash flow volatility. In addition, we have substantial tax assets, and we expect such assets to be able to defer a significant portion of our cash tax burden going forward.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and sustainable community initiatives that help address environmental sustainability concerns and local socio-economic issues. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are fun and meaningful. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are the primary supporter and corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 29,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned animals. We are committed to rescue, research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. In 2014, the SeaWorld Animal Rescue Teams based in San Diego, Orlando and San Antonio were presented the Amusement Today 2014 Persons of the Year Award for their tireless dedication to animal welfare.

 We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which improve our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs.  Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following names:
  
• | SeaWorld. SeaWorld is widely recognized as the leading marine-life theme park brand in the world. Our SeaWorld theme parks rank among the most highly attended theme parks in the industry and offer up-close interactive experiences, special dining experiences, thrilling attractions and a variety of live performances that immerse guests in the marine-life theme.

• | Busch Gardens Tampa is open year-round and features exotic animals, thrill rides and shows on 306 acres of lush natural landscape. The zoological collection is a popular attraction for families, and the portfolio of rides, including three of the world’s top 50 steel rollercoasters according to the 2016 Amusement Today Annual Survey, broaden the theme park’s appeal to teens and thrill seekers of all ages. In 2016, Busch Gardens Tampa opened Cobra’s Curse, a family-friendly spin coaster featuring an elevator-like vertical lift and an 80-foot cobra icon. Busch Gardens Tampa is also home to Falcon’s Fury, the tallest freestanding drop tower in North America, standing at 335 feet. The attraction rises more than 300 feet in the air and then pivots guests 90 degrees to a face-down dive position before dropping to the ground. In 2016, Busch Gardens Tampa was awarded the prestigious Liseberg Applause Award (the “Applause Award”) from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA). Since 1980, the Applause Award is presented by an international committee of theme park and amusement industry professionals, honoring an amusement park “whose management, operations and creative accomplishments have inspired the industry with their foresight, originality and sound business development.”

Capital Improvements
 We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay.  Our theme parks feature a variety of attractions for our guests.  Some of the new attractions in 2016 included:

• | Mako (SeaWorld Orlando): The tallest, longest and fastest roller coaster in Orlando with a new shark-themed realm with a focus on conservation and our partnership with Guy Harvey, the well-known marine wildlife artist. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cobra’s Curse (Busch Gardens Tampa): A family-friendly spin coaster featuring an elevator-like vertical lift and an 80-foot cobra icon. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discovery Point (SeaWorld San Antonio): A new dolphin habitat and underwater viewing area which also allows guests an opportunity to interact and swim with the dolphins.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During 2017, we plan to introduce an extensive lineup of new rides and attractions, including a virtual reality experience in Orlando, a new realm and a new orca presentation in San Diego and new shows and events at many other park locations.  We expect 2017 to be one of the largest new attraction years in our over 50 year history.  Some of the new attractions planned for 2017 include: 
  
• | Ocean Explorer (SeaWorld San Diego): A new 3-acre realm combining multiple aquariums, exciting rides and digital technologies. The area is designed to engage park guests in an experience centered on exploration and adventure, inspiring them to protect the wonders of our oceans. The signature attraction for the realm, called Submarine Quest, will provide guests with the opportunity to travel aboard submarines to see Ocean Explorer's remarkable undersea animals, including the giant Pacific octopus, elusive moray eels and Japanese spider crabs that measure nine feet from claw to claw. Ocean Explorer will also feature a play area and a number of other family-friendly rides, including jellies-themed swings and a shot-and-drop ride. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Orca Encounter (SeaWorld San Diego): A new Orca Encounter is expected to be introduced in San Diego which will inspire and educate guests about the majesty of these complex animals and reinforces our commitment to compelling educational experiences. The new Orca Encounter will be based on orca behavior in the wild: what they eat, how they hunt, how they navigate and how they communicate and play, helping guests gain a deeper appreciation and respect for the orcas and empowering them a sense of determination and purpose to help preserve the future of these majestic animals. This new encounter will look at broader themes such as research, rescue, conservation, habitats and distribution, husbandry and care, and social structures. The new behavioral-based orca experience, will inspire as well as educate guests about the majesty of these complex animals, and reinforces the Company's commitment to provide educational experiences.

Guests will embark on a deep sea mission alongside sea creatures inspired by extinct and legendary animals of the past, including the mighty Kraken. A custom digital overlay with uniquely designed headsets, fully integrated both mechanically and electronically into the coaster train, delivers a new one-of-a-kind adventure. The addition of VR to this fan-favorite brings a new level of excitement and interest in Kraken for both new and returning guests in a capital efficient way and will give us a foundation for exploring and building out virtual reality capabilities elsewhere.

• | Wave Breaker, The Rescue Coaster (SeaWorld San Antonio): This new jet ski-inspired multi-launch roller coaster is based on marine animal rescue missions and represents a new generation of coasters that reaffirms our mission and vision by thrilling riders while bringing awareness to the brave efforts of the SeaWorld animal teams as they join forces with organizations around the world to help ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned animals like dolphins and sea turtles. The coaster will reach heights of up to 61 feet, with the majority of its 2,600-foot track directly over water, creating the sensation that riders are surging across the park’s lake. With a minimum height requirement of 48 inches, Wave Breaker will be a dynamic coaster experience for the whole family. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | InvadR (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): The park's first wooden coaster and eighth roller coaster in total. A minimum height requirement for riders of 46 inches make it an ideal ride for adults and children to share together, but the coaster will still feature exciting ride elements, including a more than 70 foot drop and nine airtime hills. Guests will travel more than 2,100 feet through a wooded terrain and underground through a tunnel. The attraction's theme will invite riders to choose their ride, in a battle between a band of invading Vikings and the villagers. In an unusual industry move, fans will help decide the ride elements including opportunities to vote on attraction details and theming.

Maintenance and Inspection
 Safety is of utmost importance to us.  Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees.
 Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within the manufacturer’s criteria and that maintenance is conducted according to internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation.
 A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials.
 Deep Blue Creative
 In 2016, we created the Deep Blue Creative team, designed to drive the creative heartbeat of the Company. From the development of new events and entertainment concepts, to breakthrough attractions and resorts, the Deep Blue Creative team is committed to developing experiences that matter. There are six creative divisions under the umbrella of Deep Blue Creative:

• | Theme Park Development | U.S.A.: Collaborates to inspire guests through innovative culinary experiences, retail environments, and attractions, like the newly announced Kraken Virtual Reality coaster.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Theme Park Development | Global: Leads the development of all theme park growth initiatives beyond existing parks, including international expansion, exploration of new business models, feasibility and site evaluation which includes the most recently announced partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resort Development: Responsible for the business and creative development of resorts and hotels, unique hospitality experiences and land planning.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Events & Entertainment: Supports theme park entertainment teams in staging live experiences for both theatrical settings, along with culinary and retail environments. In 2016, we welcomed Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Media Enterprises: Leads our television business. Our original television series, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs, showcase our rescue and rehabilitation efforts. These Emmy-nominated programs are broadcast nationally through the ABC network. In 2016, Sea Rescue won a Daytime Emmy for “Outstanding Children’s Series”. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expedition X: Focuses on prototype development for innovative project concepts and new technology exploration. This group scans the horizon for emerging trends and inventive ways to bring guests experiences that explore both real and amazing worlds on land and sea. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Through collaboration, each division of Deep Blue Creative brings its individual expertise forward to create bold new frontiers in guest experiences, ultimately advancing the protection and preservation of our world’s wild wonders. 
 Our Animals
 We are one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations with more than 1,500 employees dedicated to animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue. Our mission is to provide experiences that matter, inspire guests through education and entertainment, and to care for and protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We believe we have one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Animals in our care include certain endangered or threatened species such as the cheetah, Bengal tiger, West Indian manatee, black rhinoceros and polar bear.
 The well-being of the animals in our care is a top priority. Our veterinarians and zoological staff have been caring for animals for more than five decades, and our expertise is a resource for zoos, aquariums and conservation organizations worldwide. Our expertise and innovation in animal husbandry have led to many advances in the care of species in zoological facilities and in the conservation of wild populations.  More than 80% of the marine mammals living in our zoological theme parks were born in human care. 
 12

We have made many pioneering contributions to the zoological community. Until the birth of our first orca calf in 1985, no zoological institution had successfully bred orcas. We have not collected a killer whale from the wild in almost 40 years.  We care for the largest orca population in zoological facilities worldwide and today have the most genetically diverse orca and dolphin population in our history. Six of our orcas are presently on loan to a third party pursuant to an agreement entered into in February 2004. Pursuant to this agreement, we receive an annual fee, which is not material to our results of operations. In addition to generating incremental revenue for our business, the agreement provides for additional housing capacity for our orcas. The agreement expires in 2031 and is renewable at the option of the parties. 
 Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in “—Conservation Efforts” and “—Philanthropy and Community Relations” below.
 Our Products and Services
 Admission Tickets
 We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. For the year ended December 31, 2016, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 61% of our total revenue. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Approximately 44% of our admission revenues are from ticket purchases made online.
 Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season and annual passes. We also offer a Fun Card at select theme parks that allows multiple visits throughout a calendar year. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours, specialty dining packages and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience.
 We also participate in joint programs that are designed to provide visitors to certain markets with flexibility and value in creating their vacation itineraries. We have partnered with several theme parks and attractions to create joint ticket products which allow guests to purchase a ticket providing access to our theme parks as well as other local area attractions.  We also partner with independent third parties who sell tickets and/or packages to our theme parks.
 We actively run promotions and campaigns to maximize revenue and manage capacity.  Recently, we introduced a simplified pricing framework to reduce complexity in the number of ticket offerings, encourage advanced purchases and provide products that are more flexible for our guests to use.  In 2015, we also launched a new website portal to give guests a balanced look at our park offerings with the ability to choose their experience, such as upgrades to include multiple parks, additional days, dining experiences, tours or animal interactions.
 Theme Park Operations
 Our theme park operations strive to deliver a high level of safety, security, guest service and cleanliness at our theme parks. The theme park operations team manages the planning and execution of the overall theme park experience on a daily basis, which is comprised of rides, shows and attractions operations, safety, security, environmental, water park and guest arrival services (including parking, tolls, admissions, guest relations, entry and exit).  Our theme park operations team identifies and leverages internal best practices across all of our theme parks in order to create a seamless and enjoyable guest experience throughout the entire visit.
Culinary Offerings
 We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable culinary experiences to our guests. Our culinary operations are strategically organized into five key guest-oriented disciplines designed to drive in-park per capita spending: restaurants, catering, carts and kiosks, specialty snacks and vending. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base.
 We offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our successful all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price. In addition, in late 2016, we introduced an all-season dining pass option at some of our park locations. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through culinary supply chain management initiatives, we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions.

Merchandise
 We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos and videos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings.
 We operate over 300 photo and specialty retail shops at our theme parks, and our retail business encompasses the entire value chain, from product design to production and sourcing, importing and logistics and visual presentation up to the point of sale. Our products encompass more than 60,000 unique SKUs annually. Whether a plush toy, a stylish apparel item showcasing an attraction, a commemorative memento or a tote to carry it all, we carry items both big and small so that every guest has a chance to find that perfect item that is a reminder of the memories made in our theme parks.
 Guests can purchase visual memories to commemorate their experience with us through real time photo and video technologies. Whether on a traditional ride or during one of our numerous animal experiences, we capture the moment through the use of state-of-the-art processes and technologies. We continue to explore and develop our photo and retail business with advanced offerings to extend beyond the visit with online opportunities to further create customized products. An example is PhotoKey through which guests can instantly view and share all of their photos using the PhotoKey app available on their smartphone devices.
 In-park games span from traditional theme park operations to arcade experiences, all with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age.  Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient and comfortable. This includes offering lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs.
 Licensing, Consumer Products and Media Enterprises
 To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through media and licensing arrangements. Our original television series, Sea Rescue and The Wildlife Docs, showcase our rescue and rehabilitation efforts. These Emmy-nominated programs are broadcast nationally through the ABC network, and have been renewed through the summer of 2018. In 2016, Sea Rescue won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children’s Series.  We also developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. 
 In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street.  In 2016, we incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC. While currently these products do not represent a material percentage of our revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through media and consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty.
 Group Events and Conventions
 We host a variety of different group events, meetings and conventions at our theme parks both during the day and at night. Our venues offer indoor and outdoor space for meetings, special events, entertainment shows, picnics, teambuilding events, group tours and special group ticket packages. Park buy-outs allow groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind the scenes tours. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility at the theme park, which is themed as a nautical wharf-side warehouse district, complete with two miniature submarines. The facility offers more than 30,000 square feet of dining space, with a ballroom that provides seating for more than 750 guests and a larger outdoor garden reception area that can accommodate additional guests. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we hosted over 1,800 group events at our theme parks across the country.
Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances
 We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities, as well as through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund.

Our Corporate Culture
 As a purpose-driven company, our corporate culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for every guest, inspiring them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world.  Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. As guests explore our parks, we train our ambassadors to create an environment where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success.
Conservation Efforts
 To achieve our purpose, we partner with organizations around the world focused on species conservation, wildlife rescue, and environmental stewardship. Through the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit organization, we invite our guests, ambassadors and vendor partners to help us support wildlife research, habitat protection, animal rescue and conservation education. We also work directly with many other conservation organizations, including the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and the American Humane Association, to ensure the sustainability of animal species in the wild. 
 SeaWorld operates one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 29,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned animals. We do this in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, along with members of accredited animal stranding networks with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. 
 We believe it is important to inspire others to have a deeper connection with nature through amazing encounters with our animals. Through our theme parks’ up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest who visits one of our parks to care for and conserve the natural world. Our animals, many who are rescued, serve as ambassadors for their species through numerous national media and public appearances, to educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places.
 Finally, our commitment to research and conservation has also led to advances in the care of animals in zoological facilities and in conserving wild populations. We have pioneered new ways to rehabilitate animals in need. For example, we helped to create nutritional formulas and custom nursing bottles to hand-feed orphaned animals and developed techniques to help save sea turtles with cracked shells, created prosthetic beaks for injured birds and outfitted injured manatees with an “animal wetsuit” allowing them to stay afloat and warm.
 Philanthropy and Community Relations
 We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts on three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and sustainable community initiatives that address environmental sustainability concerns and local socio-economic issues. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work.
 Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages by providing experiences that matter. Our philanthropic efforts reflect this commitment through educational outreach visits to inner-city schools and hosting “special wish” children to enjoy our theme parks. Plus, through our SeaWorld Cares and Busch Gardens Cares initiatives, our employees are actively involved in volunteer activities such as beach and river cleanup efforts.
 Finally, a key component of our community outreach is our long-term commitment to honoring the service of members of the U.S. military and acknowledging the sacrifices that their families have made. Currently, we offer a free admission program to the majority of our theme parks, which provides free single day passes to active military personnel and their families.
 Our Guests and Customers
 Our theme parks are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, with a total population of over 63 million people located within 150 miles of our parks. Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, our guests include local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international tourists. Our theme parks are entertainment venues and have broad demographic appeal. For the year ended December 31, 2016, families comprised 52% of our attendance with an average party size of 3.8 people.

Seasonality
 The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. One of our goals is to continue to generate cash flow throughout the year to maximize profitability and minimize the effects of seasonality, in particular at our theme parks that are open year-round. In recent years, we have begun to drive attendance during non-peak times by offering a variety of seasonal programs and events, such as shows for kids, special food and concert series, and Halloween and Christmas events. In addition, during seasonally slow times, operating costs are controlled by reducing operating hours and show schedules. Employment levels required for peak operations are met largely through part-time and seasonal hiring.
Marketing
 Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on generating profitable attendance, growing in-park per capita spending and building the value of our brands. Through advertising, including park specific messages, promotions, retail and corporate partners, digital platforms, public relations and sales initiatives, we drive awareness of and intent to visit our theme parks, attendance and higher in-park per capita spending on an international, national and regional level. Our attractive destination locations and strategy of grouping parks together creates high appeal for multi-day visits. Our strategic priorities include: (i) increasing awareness and visit intent, (ii) strengthening loyalty and retention, (iii) driving maximum revenue and (iv) using data-driven marketing to deepen our understanding of guest interests and buying behaviors. 
Intellectual Property
 Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions, content of television programs and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with Sesame Workshop and ABI as discussed below. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations.
Busch Gardens License Agreement
 Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks.

Sesame Licenses
 Sesame Place Theme Park License Agreements
 Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a SPI, Inc.), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame Workshop (f/k/a Children’s Television Workshop).

The parties have agreed to indemnify each other from and against claims and expenses in connection with our respective performance under the license agreement and any breach thereof. Sesame Workshop may terminate the license under certain circumstances, including our uncured breach or bankruptcy.
 Both agreements are scheduled to remain in effect until December 31, 2021.
 Multi-Park License
 Under a separate agreement, Sesame Workshop granted SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC rights to use the Sesame Place and Sesame Workshop names and logos, certain Sesame Street characters (including Elmo, Big Bird and Cookie Monster), and granted a limited term right of first negotiation to utilize characters from other Sesame Workshop television series at SeaWorld San Diego, SeaWorld San Antonio, SeaWorld Orlando, and our two Busch Gardens theme parks.

 Sesame Workshop has also granted us the right to develop, manufacture, distribute and sell products within our SeaWorld and Busch Gardens theme parks, at other parks in the United States that are owned or operated by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, its subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and through online stores on websites for our parks.
 Pursuant to this agreement we pay a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of licensed products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event.
 The parties have agreed to indemnify each other from and against third party claims and expenses arising from their respective performance under the agreement or any breach thereof. Sesame Workshop has the right to terminate the agreement under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC’s bankruptcy or uncured breach of the agreement, or the termination of the license agreement regarding our Sesame Place theme park.
 The agreement is scheduled to remain in effect until December 31, 2021 unless earlier terminated or extended.
 Our Industry
 We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions.
 According to the IBISWorld Report, the U.S. amusement park industry is comprised of a large number of venues ranging from a small group of high attendance, heavily themed destination theme parks to a large group of lower attendance local theme parks and family entertainment centers. According to the TEA/AECOM Report, the United States is the largest theme park market in the world with five of the ten largest theme park groups worldwide and 10 of the 25 most-visited theme parks in the world. In 2016, the U.S. amusement park industry was expected to generate approximately $16.0 billion in revenues, according to the IBISWorld Report.

Competition
 Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Studios, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Merlin Entertainments and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies.
 Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, targeted capital investments and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 5,000 full-time employees and approximately 8,300 part-time employees.  During our peak operating season in 2016, we employed approximately 13,000 seasonal employees, many of whom are high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Regulatory
 Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future.  For information on recent regulatory developments, see the “—Recent Developments—Regulatory Developments” section above.
 Insurance
 We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $125 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures of $1 million per occurrence for general liability claims, $250,000 per accident for automobile liability claims, and $750,000 per occurrence for workers compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage appropriate for businesses in our industry. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available or the availability of coverage for special or specific risks.
