ITEM 1.BUSINESS 
General
AAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as “AAR,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” unless the context indicates otherwise. AAR was founded in 1951, organized in 1955 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966. We are a diversified provider of products and services to the worldwide aviation and government and defense markets.
Fiscal 2021 began with our focus centered on managing through the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the safety of our team and navigating the unprecedented decline in commercial passenger flight hours. Our sales to commercial customers in fiscal 2021 decreased by $486.8 million or 37.6% from the prior year as the impact from COVID-19 affected all of our commercial businesses.
To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we implemented a number of actions since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to align our costs with the anticipated lower levels of demand. These actions included facility consolidations, exiting or restructuring several underperforming contracts, and eliminating discretionary spending. We also implemented actions to reduce our fixed and variable cost base which will support improved operating efficiencies and margins as commercial demand recovers.
In addition to these actions, we have also taken steps to focus on our core aviation services offering by continuing the divestiture of non-core businesses. Following the fiscal 2020 exit from our Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (“COCO”) business, we completed the sale of our composites manufacturing business in early fiscal 2021. All of these actions have simplified our portfolio and improved efficiency in our operations to position us to drive higher returns on capital.
As we continued to successfully execute on our recent government contract awards over the last few years, we achieved strong sales growth in fiscal 2021 with our government customers as sales increased $67.1 million or 8.6% over the prior year. This growth was driven from recent contract awards such as the $118 million contract from the Naval Air Systems Command in support of the U.S. Marine Corps for the procurement, modification and delivery of two C-40 aircraft.
During fiscal 2021, we also maintained a strong focus on working capital management with cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations of $108.5 million. Borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility were $109.5 million at May 31, 2021 with an availability on the facility of $471.3 million.
Over the long-term, we expect to see strength in our Aviation Services segment given its offerings of value-added services to both commercial and government and defense customers. We believe long-term commercial aftermarket growth trends are favorable. As we continue to experience growth in our government businesses and recovery in some commercial markets, our long-term strategy continues to emphasize investing in the business and capitalizing on opportunities in those markets.
Business Segments
Aviation Services
The Aviation Services segment provides aftermarket support and services for the commercial aviation and government and defense markets and accounted for approximately 95% of our sales in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. In this segment, we also provide inventory management and distribution services, maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”), and engineering services. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Supply Chain, Inc.; AAR Government Services, Inc.; AAR Aircraft & Engine Sales & Leasing, Inc.; AAR Aircraft Services, Inc.; AAR Allen Services, Inc.; AAR Landing Gear LLC; AAR Airlift Group, Inc.; and AAR International, Inc.
We sell and lease a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components and aircraft to our commercial aviation and government/defense customers.

We provide customized flight hour component inventory and repair programs, warranty claim management, and outsourcing programs for engine and airframe parts and components in support of our airline and government customers’ maintenance activities. The types of services provided under these programs include some or all of the following functions: material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, and parts and component repair and overhaul. We are also an authorized distributor for more than 30 product lines which include parts from over 300 Federal Supply Class codes, which we source from over 25 leading aviation original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”s).
We provide fleet management and operations of customer-owned aircraft for the U.S. Department of State (“DoS”) under the INL/A WASS contract. We are the prime contractor on this ten-year performance-based contract which began in fiscal 2018. Our services under the contract include operating and maintaining the global DoS fleet of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft.
We also provide customized performance-based supply chain logistics programs in support of the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and foreign governments. The types of services provided under these programs include some or all of the following functions: material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, airframe maintenance and maintenance planning, and component repair and overhaul.
We provide major airframe inspection, maintenance, repair and overhaul, painting services, line maintenance, airframe modifications, structural repairs, avionics service and installation, exterior and interior refurbishment, and engineering services and support for many types of commercial and military aircraft. We also repair and overhaul various components, landing gears, wheels, and brakes for commercial and military aircraft.
We operate six airframe maintenance facilities and one landing gear overhaul facility. Our landing gear overhaul facility is in Miami, Florida, where we repair and overhaul landing gear, wheels, brakes, and actuators for different types of commercial and military aircraft. Our U.S. airframe maintenance facilities are in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Miami, Florida; and Rockford, Illinois and our Canadian airframe maintenance facilities are in Trois Rivieres, Quebec and Windsor, Ontario. 
In addition to our North American facilities, we also have an interest in a joint venture to develop and operate an airframe maintenance facility in India. The facility is expected to receive regulatory certification in the first half of fiscal 2022 and would commence airframe maintenance operations shortly thereafter.
The majority of our product sales are made pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders. Government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts, which can include firm fixed-price contracts, cost plus fixed fee contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, we typically receive reimbursement of our costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. Some of our contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“ID/IQ”) arrangements. Certain inventory supply and management and performance-based logistics program agreements reflect negotiated terms and conditions.
To support activities within the Aviation Services segment, we acquire aviation parts and components from domestic and foreign airlines, independent aviation service companies, aircraft leasing companies, and OEMs. We have ongoing arrangements with OEMs that provide us access to parts, repair manuals, and service bulletins in support of parts manufactured by them. Although the terms of each arrangement vary, they typically are made on standard OEM terms as to duration, price, and delivery. From time to time, we purchase airframes and engines for disassembly into individual parts and components. Airframes and engines may also be leased to airlines on a short-term basis prior to disassembly or sale.
Expeditionary Services
The Expeditionary Services segment primarily consists of products and services supporting the movement of equipment and personnel by the U.S. and foreign governments and non-governmental organizations. The Expeditionary Services segment accounted for approximately 5% of our sales in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Manufacturing, Inc. and Brown International Corporation.

We design, manufacture, and repair transportation pallets and a wide variety of containers and shelters used in support of military and humanitarian tactical deployment activities. The containers and shelters are used in numerous mission requirements, including armories, supply and parts storage, refrigeration systems, tactical operation centers, briefing rooms, laundry and kitchen facilities, water treatment, and sleeping quarters. Shelters include both stationary and vehicle-mounted applications.We also provide engineering, design, and system integration services for specialized command and control systems.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we sold our composites manufacturing business which resulted in a charge of $20.2 million. The sale of the Composites business is consistent with our multi-year strategy to focus our portfolio on our core services offerings, and the transaction has allowed us to further prioritize our efforts in our principal operations.
Sales in this segment are generally made to customers pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders and contracts. Government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts, which can include firm fixed-price contracts, cost plus fixed fee contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. Some of our contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products under ID/IQ arrangements, however, the majority of our products and services are procured via definite contracts.
Raw Materials
Although we generated approximately 55% of our fiscal 2021 sales from the sale of products, we are generally engaged in only limited manufacturing activities and have minimal exposure to fluctuations in both the availability and pricing of raw materials. We purchase raw materials for our manufacturing operations, including steel, aluminum, extrusions, balsa, and other necessary supplies from several vendors. Where necessary, we have been able to obtain raw materials and other inventory items from numerous sources for each segment at competitive prices, terms, and conditions, and we expect to be able to continue to do so.
Terms of Sale
We generally sell our products and services under standard 30-day payment terms. On occasion, certain customers will negotiate extended payment terms of 60-90 days. Except for customary warranty provisions, customers neither have the right to return products nor do they have the right to extended financing. Our government contracts may extend several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. The government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, or modify some contracts at its convenience.
Customers
The principal customers for our products and services in the Aviation Services segment are domestic and foreign passenger airlines, domestic and foreign cargo airlines, regional and commuter airlines, business and general aviation operators, OEMs, aircraft leasing companies, aftermarket aviation support companies, the DoD and its contractors, the DoS, and foreign military organizations or governments. In the Expeditionary Services segment, our principal customers include the DoD and its contractors, foreign military organizations or governments, defense organizations, and OEMs.
Sales of aviation products and services to our commercial airline customers are generally affected by such factors as the number, type and average age of aircraft in service, the levels of aircraft utilization (e.g., frequency of schedules, flying hours, and take-off and landing cycles), the number of airline operators, the general economy, and the level of sales of new and used aircraft. Sales to the DoD and other government agencies are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, government funding, competitive bidding, and requirements generated by worldwide geopolitical events. 
We primarily market and sell products and services through our own employees. In certain markets outside of the United States, we rely on foreign sales representatives to assist in the sale of our products and services.

Sales to Government and Defense Customers
Sales to global government and defense customers (including sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government) were $845.9 million (51.2% of consolidated sales), $778.8 million (37.6% of consolidated sales) and $677.9 million (33.0% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $738.8 million (44.7% of consolidated sales), $668.2 million (32.2% of consolidated sales) and $546.2 million (26.6% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
​
Sales to government and defense customers are reported in each of our reportable segments (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue at levels previously experienced. The majority of our U.S. government sales are for products and services supporting the DoD logistics and mobility strategy and supporting DoS flight operations. Thus, our government contracts have changed, and may continue to change, with fluctuations in defense and other governmental agency spending and requirements. Our government contracts are also often subject to termination for convenience by the customer; in the event of such a termination, we are contractually entitled to recover all allowable costs incurred by us through the date of termination.
Government Regulation and Certificates
The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) regulates the manufacture, repair, and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States. Similar rules and regulatory authorities exist in other countries. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by these regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft engines, certain engine parts, and airframes at regular intervals based on take off and landing cycles or flight time. Our businesses, which sell defense products and services directly to the U.S. government or through its contractors, can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors.
We have nine FAA certificated repair stations in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Of the nine certificated FAA repair stations, seven are also European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”) and three are also Transport Canada Civil Aviation (“TCCA”) certificated repair stations. Such certificates, which are ongoing in duration, are required for us to perform authorized maintenance, repair, and overhaul services for our customers and are subject to revocation by the government for non-compliance with applicable regulations. All of the certificated repair stations are in the Aviation Services segment. We believe that we possess all licenses and certifications that are material to the conduct of our business.
Competition
Competition in each of our markets is based on quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of delivery, and price. Competitors in our Aviation Services segment include OEMs, the service divisions of large commercial airlines, and other independent suppliers of parts, repair, and overhaul services to the commercial and defense markets. Our Expeditionary Services segment competes with a number of divisions of large corporations and other large and small companies. Although certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we have maintained a satisfactory competitive position through our responsiveness to customer needs, our attention to quality, and our unique combination of market expertise and technical and financial capabilities.
Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to derive from unshipped orders or signed contracts. Backlog includes our remaining performance obligations based on the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not yet been performed as of May 31, 2021. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under contracts such as ID/IQ contracts. 
At May 31, 2021, our firm backlog was approximately $750 million and we expect that approximately 40% of this backlog will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with approximately 45% of the remaining balance recognized as revenue over the next three years.

Human Capital Resources
As of May 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,700 employees worldwide, with approximately 3,300 employees in the United States and approximately 1,400 employees outside of the United States. We also retained approximately 220 contract workers as of May 31, 2021, the majority of whom are located at our airframe maintenance facilities. We retain these contract workers as they provide unique skill sets which are necessary at certain facilities as well as mitigate the impact of demand variability with our customers.
Our employees set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. In particular, the employees in our MRO facilities, sales, and quality assurance departments are instrumental in driving operational execution and strong financial performance, and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program.
The success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To achieve this objective we have formulated a human capital management strategy, which includes the components below:
Commitment to Safety
One of our primary objectives is the health and safety of our employees. The commitment to safety starts at the top levels of our organization. In December 2020, our Board of Directors formed an Aviation Safety and Training Committee that oversees safety and training matters on the Board’s behalf. We believe a safe and secure workplace is fundamental and important to our success and we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace, and complying with applicable safety and health laws, regulations and internal requirements. We are also committed to engaging our employees to continually improve health and safety by acting upon opportunities to reduce risk and improve our safety and health performance. We maintain comprehensive safety programs focused on identifying hazards and eliminating risks that can lead to severe injuries.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
We focus on paying our employees competitively. We strive to provide competitive pay opportunities which reward our employees for achieving and exceeding objectives that create long-term value for shareholders. Providing competitive pay enhances our ability to attract and retain strong, innovative talent.
Providing comprehensive, competitive and affordable benefits is important to our attraction and retention strategy. We offer health benefits which include various medical/pharmacy plan options as well as a cost comparison tool to assist employees with their decisions. Health savings accounts for those in a high deductible health plan and flexible spending accounts for both health care and dependent care are also available to employees. The retirement, investment, and tax savings/deferral opportunities offered to employees include competitive 401k benefits and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Employees are eligible for paid and unpaid leaves and, in addition, we offer a variety of other benefits to meet the needs of employees including an employee assistance program which provides some free counseling sessions, educational assistance and adoption assistance. Some of our facilities have fitness centers on site for employees to use.
Diversity, Inclusion and Engagement
We are an equal opportunity employer and recognize the value of a diverse workforce. We have established company-wide Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. 
We are continually seeking out new ways to broaden our exposure to underrepresented groups in the aviation industry and to develop a diverse talent pipeline. Our ERGs support the development of diverse talent internally and promote the acquisition of talent externally.

Business Ethics
Our Code of Conduct ("Code") is a statement of the principles and standards that we expect our employees to follow. Each officer, director and employee is required to use good ethical judgement when conducting business and comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Code describes what is appropriate behavior and guides ethical business decisions that maintain a commitment to integrity. Failure to comply with the Code and applicable laws can have severe consequences for both us and individuals involved, including disciplinary action, civil penalties or criminal prosecution under certain circumstances.
