Business Introduction/Summary
 
References herein to “we,” “us,” “Sunworks,” and “the Company” are to Sunworks, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Sunworks United, Inc. (“Sunworks United”), MD Energy, Inc. (“MD Energy”), and Elite Solar Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“Elite Solar”). 
 
We provide photovoltaic (“PV”) based power systems for the agricultural, commercial, industrial and residential markets in California, Oregon, Texas, New Mexico, and Nevada. Through our operating subsidiaries, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install, and manage systems ranging in size from 2kW (kilowatt) for residential loads to multi MW (megawatt) systems for larger commercial projects. Commercial installations have included office buildings, manufacturing plants, warehouses, and agricultural facilities such as farms, wineries, and dairies. The Company provides a full range of installation services to our solar energy customers including design, system engineering, procurement, permitting, construction, grid connection, warranty, system monitoring and maintenance.
 
We adhere to the business principles of:
 

1. | Doing what is right for the customer; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Delivering the best value in our industry; and 
3. | Doing what we say we will do. 

 
We installed 976 residential systems in 2016 in California, Oregon and Nevada with approximately 6.8 MW of capacity. In 2015, we installed approximately 650 residential systems in California and Nevada with approximately 4.5 MW of capacity. The change between years represents a 50% increase in the number of residential systems and MW capacity installed.
 
We currently operate in one segment based upon our organizational structure and the way in which our operations are managed and evaluated. Approximately 67% of our 2016 revenue was from sales to the commercial market, including the agricultural market, and approximately 33% of our revenue was from sales to the residential market. Approximately 60% of our 2015 revenue was from sales to the commercial market, including the agricultural market, and approximately 40% of our revenue was from sales to the residential market.

Market Opportunity
 
We believe the following trends will contribute to the growth and prospects of our business:
 

● | Growing Market for Solar Energy. The markets for residential and commercial & industrial (C&I) distributed solar energy are growing rapidly. According to research compiled by GTM Research, an industry research firm, and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), 14.8 gigawatts of capacity was installed within the U.S. solar energy market in 2016, up 97% over 2015. This growth was driven by the anticipated expiration of the investment tax credit, which created a boom in all markers, residential, C&I and utility scale solar. Although GTM Research/SEIA forecasts that total installations will be down 10.3% this year, the markets that Sunworks targets are expected to continue to grow by 9% in residential and 11% in C&I. We believe that the market for solar energy will continue to grow in the US due to favorable economics that are consistent with the Sunworks model. In the last year the price of solar modules has decreased by more than 40% and more residential and C&I customers are turning to solar because it saves money. As prices decline, more consumers are purchasing their solar systems. For the first time since 2010 more homeowners purchased their solar systems than leased or entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs). This trend indicates that “self-owned” solar is now the low-cost option for consumers in many markets. Since solar energy is still less than 2% of electricity generation in the U.S., there is significant growth opportunity in the immediate future. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for distributed solar energy to increasingly displace traditional retail electricity generated from fossil fuels. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Strong Regional Markets. According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Report, California will continue to be the largest market for both residential and C&I, accounting for 36% and 32% of all solar installed across the country in 2017. As the market matures and policies change, we see the market segmenting into regions based on utilities districts, with local and regional companies enjoying much greater growth rates than national companies. Companies that have strong reputations for quality installations and professional sales staff will continue to see their market share increase as more homeowners and C&I companies buy “local” at the expense of national firms. 

Strategy
 
Our strategy for growth continues to include organic growth and growth through acquisition. However, while we continue to seek opportunistic acquisitions, we now focus on growing organically. With scalable administrative and operational infrastructure in place, our organic growth strategy emphasizes the hiring of highly qualified, and motivated project developers who have a thorough understanding of the economics of our offering and the needs of our existing and potential customers. This approach will allow us to grow in our current geography as well as expand in to new territories throughout the Western United States. We anticipate taking advantage of the real growth in the solar market as well as gaining market share relative to key competitors.
 
In addition to pure organic growth, we have established commercial partnerships with other companies in the Southwestern US including Arizona and Texas, which will allow us to take advantage of emerging opportunities in those areas and beyond. We anticipate that the markets that we have entered via partnerships will show positive results in 2017 and grow into a substantial part of our business over time. Other less formal partnerships have been developed within our home territory that allows us access to many bid opportunities to which we had not previously had access.
 
In our residential business, we have expanded our methods of acquiring customers to include collaborating with third party residential sales companies. We believe that the scarce resource in the residential solar industry is quality, economic installations in which customers can trust. We provide outstanding operations and customer support, which have driven substantial demand for our branded installations. The result is that our sales partners can sell with confidence knowing that they are backed by installation and operations on which they can rely. We have had robust activity in developing relationships with outstanding sales companies. With some in-house direct sales in place and a robust referral business through our “Power Pay Plan”, we believe that we will add quality sales partners and grow our residential sales substantially faster than the market.
 
The success of our growth and quality partnerships is based on the reputation that we have developed for high quality and economical operations that our customers have come to rely on. We are very protective of our reputation and will continue to base our business on our guiding principles of putting our customers first, providing the best value in the industry and doing what we say we will do.

Company Operations
 
Employees
 
We employ a total of approximately 250 full-time employees. We may also utilize outside subcontractors to assist with installing solar systems for our commercial customers. Our direct installation labor is a combination of employees and contract labor. With each acquisition, we look to transition most back office functions to our corporate headquarters to reduce costs and make our operations consistent across our subsidiaries. We believe that our strategy of consolidating such functions as purchasing, supplier relations, accounting, human resources and other basic functions help to realize cost advantages and strategic synergies.
Sales and Marketing
 
We have approximately 60 employees primarily focused on sales, sales support and marketing in California, Oregon, Texas, New Mexico, and Nevada.
 
We also made a significant investment in residential customer acquisition in 2016. This aggressive approach included increases in media and direct advertising. The residential sales approach included the creation and staffing of a call center to support direct sales personnel for residential systems. In a matter of months, it was determined that the two-pronged residential sales approach of increasing the media advertising spend and staffing a call center was not cost effective and was discontinued.
 
Historically, we have had specially-designed marketing efforts and tracking systems in place that enabled us to attract new customers at a low cost and higher conversion rate than what we believe to be the industry average. We utilized several marketing tools and business strategies to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and attract new customers. We learned that this approach is not easily scalable but results in a steady stream of business when managed properly. We are now working more with third-party sales originators to generate most of its residential customer installations and mitigate the fixed costs and financial risk of maintaining its own direct sales force.
 
We have an advantage in the commercial solar market given our extensive contact list, resulting from our experience in the commercial and industrial construction market, which provides access to customer lists. Through our network of vendors, participation in variety of industry trade associations and independent sales consultants, we now have a growing list of repeat clients, as well as an active and loyal referral network.
 
Financing
 
To promote sales, we assist customers in obtaining financing. Our objective is to arrange the most flexible terms that meet the needs and wants of the customer. Although we do not provide financing ourselves, we have relationships to arrange financing with numerous private and public sources, including PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) Programs, which are programs that involve both municipal governments and private financing companies that allow property owners to receive upfront funding for renewable energy projects, and Farm Credit financing offered by a network of lending institutions.
 
We believe it is best for customers to own their own systems, but some customers prefer not to own their systems. We also have the ability to arrange financing with third parties through PPAs and leases for our customers.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase solar panels and materials directly from multiple manufacturers. We intend to further coordinate purchases and optimize supply relationships to realize the advantages of greater scale.
 
If one or more of our suppliers fail to meet our anticipated demand, ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. We do not, however, rely on any single supplier and, we believe, we can obtain needed solar panels and materials from a number of different suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not materially affect our business.
 
We also utilize strategic companies with subcontractors for electrical installations, for racking and module installations, as well as numerous subcontractors for grading, landscaping, and construction for our large agricultural, commercial, and industrial customers.
 
Installation
 
We are a licensed contractor in the markets we serve, and we are responsible for every customer installation. We manage the entire process from permitting through inspection to interconnection to the power grid, thereby making the system installation process simple and seamless for our customers. Controlling every aspect of the installation process allows us to minimize costs, ensure quality and deliver high levels of customer satisfaction.
 
Even with controlling every aspect of the installation process, the ability to perform on a contract is subject to limitations. There remain approval processes outside our immediate control whether the authority having jurisdiction be a city, a county, a state or the Federal government or one of its agencies in addition to the various utility companies and the weather.

After-Sales Support
 
It is our intent to provide continuing operation and maintenance services for our installed residential and commercial PV system. We provide extended factory equipment technical support and act as a service liaison using our proprietary knowledge, technology, and solar electric energy engineering staff. We do this through a 25 Year Limited Workmanship Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Program, which among other things provides a service and technical support line to our customers. We generally respond to our job site related issues within 24 hours and offer assistance as long as required to maintain customer satisfaction. Our price to customers includes this warranty, which is essentially a pass through of the manufacturers’ warranties.
 
Facilities
 
 We maintain sales and installation offices in Roseville, Rocklin, Durham, Campbell (San Jose), Tulare, Turlock, and Rancho Cucamonga, California, in Reno, Nevada, and in White City, Oregon. We lease all of our offices and facilities.
Customers
 
Currently, the majority of our revenue comes from installations in California, Nevada with a small amount in Oregon. Approximately 67% of our sales in 2016 were in the commercial/agricultural market, up from 60% in 2015. Approximately 33% of revenues was generated by residential installations, down from 40% in 2015. We expect that these percentages will vary from year to year.
 
We install systems for the commercial market, which includes offerings to agricultural customers. We define small commercial projects as the installation of systems under 100kW, whereas large commercial projects involve the installation of systems greater than 100kW. Solar projects have received limited financing from traditional lending sources but we are encouraged by municipal PACE programs in California which have drawn funding sources such as Ygrene and California First into the financing of energy projects. Cycle times vary from twenty to thirty-five weeks, which is a common cycle for commercial projects. Larger projects typically have a longer cycle time than smaller projects. Agricultural system sizes vary significantly within this sector and can range from 10kW to multiple megawatts. Agricultural loans to farmers and tax-oriented leases are the primary funding sources within the industry. Similar to commercial installations, cycle times for agricultural projects may commonly range from twenty weeks to more than a year depending upon the authority having jurisdiction, the existing utility infrastructure and the various approvals required.
 
Our residential operations address the needs of property owners installing systems smaller than 20kW. The typical residential system installed is about 7kW with an average cycle time of 45 days. We facilitate purchase or lease financing and offer product options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
Competitors
 
In the solar installation market, we compete with companies that offer products similar to ours. Some of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience, and technical capabilities than us. When bidding for solar installation projects, however, our current experience suggests that there is no clear dominant or preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We do not believe that any competitor has more than 10% of the market across all the areas that we operate. We compete with other solar installers on pricing, service and the ability to arrange financing. On a global scale, we also compete, on a cost basis, with traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers and with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. Our advantage over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create their own electricity and detach from the traditional electrical grid.
Seasonality
 
Exposure to seasonality in our sales patterns is partially mitigated because of the breadth of our business offerings to residential, commercial and agricultural customers. We do find, however, that some customers tend to book projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end. This, historically, results in fourth quarter bookings being more robust usually at the expense of the first quarter. The first quarter in California often has rain, which also reduces our ability to install and recognize revenues in that quarter relative to the remainder of the year.

Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Generally, the solar installation business is not dependent on intellectual property. Research and development costs for the development of the 3D cell ended in 2016.
 
In 2015, we spent $53,000 for research and patent work for a 3-dimensional solar cell. As the price of existing solar modules has dropped, the risk and projected cost to further develop, test and manufacture the 3-dimensional cell is not justifiable. The Company received a patent for the 3-dimensional solar cell for China during 2016.
 
During 2015, we have invested in the development and implementation of Vista by Viewpoint, an enterprise management system, to facilitate the integration and management of our recent and any future acquisitions. We began working with the new software in 2016 for accounting. Additional functionality will be added overtime.
 
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business.
 
To operate our systems we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility and us and/or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 
Government Incentives
 
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers to own or lease, our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.
 
The Federal government currently offers a 30% Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the ITC, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2016. By statute, this tax credit was scheduled to decrease to 10% on January 1, 2017, but was extended in December 2015, by Congress through 2019, after which it will fall to 26% in 2020, 22% in 2021 and 10% in 2022.
 
The economics of purchasing a solar energy system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.
 
Approximately 50% of states in the U.S. offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, these states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements, and credits. Many state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their solar energy system during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Depending on the cost of the system and other site-specific variables, tax incentives can typically cover 30-40% of the cost of a commercial or residential solar system.

Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production. Thirty States and the District of Columbia have adopted a renewable portfolio standard that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the State from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date. California’s renewable portfolio standard requires all utilities in the state to source 33% of their electric generation from renewable resources by 2020.
 
In December 2015, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission announced a net metering rate change. Effective January 1, 2016, the new tariffs will gradually increase the monthly fees that solar users pay to use the electric grid and cut users’ reimbursements by 75% for feeding electricity into the grid. The Commission’s decision is retroactive. Following public outcry, the Commission agreed to hold hearings to reconsider imposing the new rates on existing solar users, and NV Energy Department announced that it would not insist on the immediate retroactive provision but will gradually phase in the new rates for all solar customers over a 12-year period. In response to the regulation, we have begun to shift focus from the residential to the commercial markets which we believe still have economic viability.
 
Corporate History
 
We were originally incorporated in Delaware on January 30, 2002 as MachineTalker, Inc. In September 2010, we shifted our engineering and research focus to developing a new means for generating solar-produced electrical power for use in the manufacture of highly efficient solar cells. In July 2010, we changed our company name to Solar3D, Inc. to better reflect our new business plan and filed for patent protection covering our new concepts for 3D solar cell designs. On January 31, 2014, we acquired 100% of the stock of Sunworks United, a California corporation. On March 2, 2015, we acquired MD Energy. On December 1, 2015, we acquired Plan B through a merger of Plan B Enterprises, Inc. into our wholly owned subsidiary, Elite Solar Acquisition Sub., Inc. On March 1, 2016 we changed our name to Sunworks, Inc. with simultaneous NASDAQ stock symbol change from SLTD to SUNW.
