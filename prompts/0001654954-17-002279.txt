 ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
 As used in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” "Zoom” and the “Company” mean Zoom Telephonics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary MTRLC LLC.
  
 Zoom Telephonics designs, produces, markets, sells, and supports Internet access and other communications-related products including cable modems and gateways, mobile broadband modems, Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (“ADSL” or commonly “DSL”) modems, and dial-up modems. Our primary objective is to build upon our position as a leading producer of Internet access devices sold through sales channels that include many of the largest United States (“USA” or “US”) high-volume electronics retailers, and to take advantage of a number of trends in communications including higher data rates, increasing use of wireless technology for transmission of data, and increasing use of smartphones, tablets, and streaming media.
  
 Cable modem products, including both cable modems and cable gateways, were Zoom’s highest revenue product category in both 2016 and 2015. Cable modems provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through a cable that connects to the cable service provider’s managed broadband network. When a cable modem also includes a built-in WiFi router, it is called a cable gateway. We began shipping cable modems in 2000. Our primary means of distribution to end-users in the US, our primary market, is through national retailers and distributors. We continue to sell cable modem products under the Zoom brand, and beginning in 2016 we started offering cable modems and gateways under the Motorola brand. In response to demand for faster connection speeds and increased functionality including improved WiFi performance, we have invested and continue to invest resources to advance our cable modem product line.
  
 Our mobile broadband products provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through access to a mobile service provider’s mobile broadband network. Zoom has sold mobile broadband modems and routers in the past, and Zoom plans to ship a new line of mobile broadband modems, routers, and sensors in 2017.
  
 Our DSL modems provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through a telephone line that typically connects to compatible DSL equipment that is typically managed by the DSL service provider. In past years Zoom has shipped a broad line of DSL modems. Zoom’s primary DSL product today includes a DSL modem and a 802.11n (“wireless-N”) router.
  
 Our dial-up modems connect personal computers and other devices to the local telephone line for transmission of data, fax, voice, and other information. Our dial-up modems enable personal computers and other devices to connect to other computers and networks, including the Internet, at top data speeds up to 56,000 bits per second. Zoom’s sales of dial-up modems, our largest source of revenues from the mid-eighties through 2010, are expected to continue their decline due to the ongoing adoption of broadband access.
  
 In August 2016 we extended our Motorola license to a worldwide license that includes cable modems and gateways, WiFi routers, WiFi range extenders, powerline communication devices, and related products. We plan to introduce a line of Motorola brand WiFi routers, range extenders, and powerline communication products in 2017.

 We are incorporated in Delaware under the name Zoom Telephonics, Inc.  Zoom Telephonics, Inc. was originally incorporated in New York in 1977 and changed its state of incorporation to Delaware in 1993. MTRLC LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zoom Telephonics, Inc., is a limited liability company organized in Delaware that focuses on the sale of our Motorola brand products. Our principal executive offices are located at 99 High Street, Boston, MA 02110, and our telephone number is (617) 423-1072. Our Web site is at www.zoomtel.com. Information contained on our web site does not constitute part of this prospectus. Our common stock is traded on the Over-The-Counter market (“OTCQB”) under the symbol ZMTP.
  
  Available Information
 
 Our Internet website address is www.zoomtel.com. Through our website we make available, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. These SEC reports can be accessed through the investor relations section of our website and at the SEC’s web site.
 Products
  
  General
  
 The vast majority of our products involve communication of data through the Internet. Our cable modems connect to the cable-TV cable and our DSL modems connect to the local telephone line to provide a high-speed link to the Internet. Our mobile broadband modems and our coming mobile broadband routers and sensors connect to the Internet through a mobile service provider’s mobile broadband cellular network.  Our dial-up modems link computers, point-of-purchase terminals, or other devices to each other or the Internet through the traditional telephone network. Our router products may communicate with a broadband modem for access to the Internet, and they may also be used for local area network communications.  Our planned sensor products will connect sensors to users’ smartphones and Web browsers via a mobile broadband connection to the Internet.
 Cable Modems
  
 We have obtained CableLabs® certification for our currently marketed cable modems, and these cable modems have also received a number of cable service provider certifications. The lengthy, expensive, and technically challenging certification process has been and continues to be a significant barrier to entry.
  
 Zoom sells cable modems to end-users through retailers and cable service providers. While sales through the retail channel have been significant, they have been handicapped by the fact that all cable service providers offer cable modems directly with their service. Our view is that cable service providers are required to separately state the non-subsidized rental fees of carrier-provided modems and to eliminate this fee if the consumer chooses to provide the modem, but that view has been challenged by Charter. Charter has not complied with these requirements, thereby hindering consumer choice and the retail modem market.  Nevertheless, Zoom has significant cable modem sales through retailers, often to end-users who want to eliminate a monthly cable modem rental charge from their cable service provider.
  
 During 2015 Zoom’s cable modem revenues were primarily from four types of Zoom brand cable modems, all supporting Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (“DOCSIS”) 3.0 with either 16 or 8 downstream channels and 4 upstream channels (“16x4” or “8x4”). One product was an 8x4 cable modem bridge, one was a 16x4 cable modem bridge, one was an 8x4 cable modem gateway that included an N300 wireless-N router, and one was an 8x4 cable modem gateway that included an 802.11ac (“wireless-AC”) AC1900 router. Zoom continues to sell Zoom brand cable modems, but Zoom’s primary cable modem sales in 2016 were of Motorola brand cable modem products.
  
 In May 2015 Zoom entered into an agreement to license certain Motorola trademarks from Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC (“Motorola”) for cable modem products. From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020 we are authorized to manufacture, sell and market consumer cable modem products through certain authorized sales channels using the Motorola trademarks. The agreement includes numerous requirements intended to assure the quality and reputation of Motorola brand products. In January 2016 Zoom, through its MTRLC LLC subsidiary which was formed on October 6, 2015, began shipping cable modems under the Motorola brand. Zoom will also continue to ship Zoom brand cable modems, but these will be distinctly different from our Motorola brand cable modem products. On August 8, 2016, Zoom entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Motorola. The amendment expands Zoom’s exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide, and expands the license from cable modems and gateways to also include consumer routers, WiFi range extenders, home powerline network adapters, and related products.

 MTRLC LLC currently ships six Motorola brand cable modem products. The least expensive product in this line is an 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem, and the most expensive is a cable gateway that includes a 16x4 DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem and an AC1900 WiFi router with Power Boost. Zoom is continuing to develop new cable modems, including a DOCSIS 3.1 cable modem.
  
  DSL Modems
  
 Our DSL modems incorporate the ADSL standards that are currently most popular worldwide, including ADSL2/2+, G.dmt, G.Lite, and ANSI T1.413 issue 2. Zoom currently sells one type of ADSL modem, which has an integrated wireless-N 4-port router using Broadcom Integrated Circuit (“IC”) technology.
  
  Mobile Broadband Modems and Routers
  
 During the second half of 2009 Zoom began shipping its first mobile broadband or “cellular” products, mobile broadband modems and wireless-N routers. In 2017 Zoom plans to introduce a new line of mobile broadband modems, with different models designed to work with AT&T, Verizon, and other mobile broadband carriers worldwide. Zoom also plans to introduce a cellular gateway that includes a modem capable of speeds up to 100 Mbps and an AC1900 router.
  
  Dial-Up Modems
  
 We have a broad line of dial-up modems with top data speeds up to 56,000 bps, available in external and internal models. Many of our external modems are designed to work with almost any terminal or computer, or operating system including Windows, Apple, Linux, and others. Personal Computer (“PC”) oriented internal modems are designed primarily for installation in the Peripheral Component Interconnect (“PCI”) slot, PCI-E slot, or PC card slot of IBM PC-compatibles. Embedded internal modems are designed to be embedded in PCs dedicated for a specific application, such as point-of-purchase terminals, kiosks, and set-top boxes. We sell and market dial-up modems under the Zoom® and Hayes® brands, as well as selling unbranded or private labeled modems for some specific high-volume accounts.
  
  Mobile Broadband Sensors
  
  In 2017 Zoom plans to introduce a line of sensor products that communicate sensor data via a built-in cellular modem through the Internet to a smartphone or browser-enabled device. This cellular approach makes these sensors easier to install than a sensor that requires a router and a broadband connection. This approach can be teamed up with a very low cost data plan, since the amount of data being transmitted is low. The simplest product will only communicate temperature, and Zoom plans to have a range of products including a multi-sensor that senses temperature, humidity, earthquake and other acceleration, motion, pressure, light, and sound. Zoom believes that there is significant potential for cellular sensor products, but that there are significant risks including risk relating to delays in finishing these products and risks from competitors.
Products for Markets outside North America
  
 Products for countries outside the US often differ from a similar product for the US due to different regulatory and certification requirements, country-specific phone jacks and AC power adapters, and language-related specifics. As a result, the introduction of new products into markets outside North America can be costly and time-consuming. In 1993 we introduced our first dial-up modem approved for selected Western European countries. Since then we have continued to expand our product offerings into markets outside North America. We have received regulatory certifications for, and are currently selling our products in a number of countries, including the US, the United Kingdom (“UK”), Spain, Canada, Vietnam, and some Latin American countries. We intend to continue to expand and enhance our product line for our existing markets and to seek certifications for the sale of new products outside the US. Most importantly, we hope to sell Motorola brand WiFi products in China, Latin America, Europe, and other regions outside the USA. The vast majority of our sales were in North America in 2015 and in 2016, and we expect North America to continue to account for most of our sales. However, we expect significant growth outside North America due to our worldwide Motorola license for WiFi and powerline products.
 Sales Channels
  
  General
  
 We sell our products primarily through high-volume retailers and distributors, Internet service providers, service providers, value-added resellers, PC system integrators, and Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"). We support our major accounts in their efforts to discern strategic directions in the market, to maintain appropriate inventory levels, and to offer a balanced selection of attractive products.

 Relatively few customers have accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s revenues.  In 2016 three customers accounted for 82% of our total net sales, with our largest customer accounting for 29% of our net sales. At December 31, 2016, three customers accounted for 86% of our gross accounts receivable, with our largest customer representing 56% of our gross accounts receivable. In 2015 three customers accounted for 77% of the Company’s total net sales with our largest customer accounting for 46% of our net sales. At December 31, 2015, three customers accounted for 93% of our gross accounts receivable, with our largest customer representing 67% of our gross accounts receivable.
  
  Distributors and Retailers outside North America
  
 In markets outside North America we sell and ship our products primarily to distributors. We believe that sales growth outside North America will continue to require substantial additional investments of resources for product design and testing, regulatory certifications, native-language instruction manuals and software, packaging, sales support, and technical support. We have made this investment in the past for many countries, and we expect to make this investment for some countries and products in the future.   However, we anticipate that the vast majority of our future sales will come from the US, largely because the US has an unusually robust retail cable modem market.
  
 We have announced a master distributor agreement with T&W, a Chinese manufacturer and our primary supplier, whereby T&W will be the master distributor for some of our Motorola brand product categories in China. We hope to have similar agreements for some other countries, but there is no guarantee that we will have such agreements. We have a distributor for Latin America, and we hope that distributor will sell some of our Motorola brand WiFi products. We hope to add other distributors for some countries outside North America. We also expect to sell some Motorola brand WiFi products through Amazon UK and other Amazon sites in Europe.
  
  North American High-volume Retailers and Distributors
  
 In North America we reach the retail market primarily through high-volume retailers. Our North American retailers include Best Buy, Micro Center, Target, Wal-Mart, and others including Amazon and other Web-focused retailers.
  
 We sell significant quantities of our products through distributors, who often sell to corporate accounts, retailers, service providers, value-added resellers, equipment manufacturers, and other customers. Our North American distributors include D&H Distributing, Ingram Micro, and Tech Data.
  
  Internet and Telephone Service Providers
  
 In past years our sales have included DSL modems sold to DSL service providers in the US and in some other countries. We plan to continue selling and supporting these customers. In addition, we will continue to offer some of our cable modem and mobile broadband products to service providers.
 System Integrators and Original Equipment Manufacturers
  
 Our system integrator and OEM customers sell our products under their own name or incorporate our products as a component of their systems. We seek to be responsive to the needs of these customers by providing on-time delivery of high-quality, reliable, cost-effective products with strong engineering and sales support. We believe that some of these customers also appreciate the improvement in their products' image due to use of a Zoom or Hayes brand modem.
 Sales, Marketing & Support
  
 Our sales, marketing, and support are primarily managed from our headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. In North America we sell our Zoom, Motorola, Hayes, and private-label dial-up modem products through Zoom's sales force and through commissioned independent sales representatives managed and supported by our own staff. Most service providers are serviced by Zoom's sales force. Worldwide technical support is primarily handled from our Boston headquarters.
  
 We believe that Motorola, Zoom, Hayes, and Global Village are widely recognized brand names. We build upon our brand equity in a variety of ways, including Amazon advertising, Google Adwords advertising, Facebook advertising, retailer cooperative advertising, product packaging, trade shows, and public relations.

 We attempt to develop quality products that are user-friendly and that require minimal support. We typically support our claims of quality with product warranties of one to two years, depending upon the product. To address the needs of end-users and resellers who require assistance, we have our own staff of technical support specialists.  They provide telephone support five days per week in English and Spanish. Our technical support specialists also maintain a significant Internet support facility that includes email, firmware and software downloads, and the SmartFacts™ Q&A search engine.
  
  Research & Development
  
 Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new products, enhancing the capabilities of existing products, and reducing production costs. We have developed close collaborative relationships with certain of our Original Design Manufacturer (“ODM”) suppliers and component suppliers. We work with these partners and other sources to identify and respond to emerging technologies and market trends by developing products that address these trends. In addition, we purchase modems and other chipsets that incorporate sophisticated technology from third parties, thereby eliminating the need for us to develop this technology in-house. We do however develop products in-house, including some modems and our Connected Home product line.
  
 The Company’s costs on research and development were $1.5 million for 2016 and $1.3 million for 2015. As of December 31, 2016 we had 10 employees engaged primarily in research and development. Our research and development team performs electronics hardware design and layout, mechanical design, prototype construction and testing, component specification, firmware and software development, product testing, foreign and domestic regulatory certification efforts, end-user and internal documentation, and third-party software selection and testing.
  
  Manufacturing & Suppliers
  
 Our products are currently designed for high-volume automated assembly to help assure reduced costs, rapid market entry, short lead times, and reliability. High-volume assembly typically occurs in China or Taiwan. Our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers typically obtain some or all of the material required to assemble the products based upon a Zoom Telephonics Approved Vendor List and Parts List. Our manufacturers typically insert parts onto the printed circuit board, with most parts automatically inserted by machine, solder the circuit board, and test the completed assemblies. The contract manufacturer sometimes performs final packaging. For the US and many other markets, packaging is often performed at our facilities in North America, allowing us to tailor the packaging and its contents for our customers immediately before shipping. This facility also performs warehousing, shipping, quality control, finishing and some software updates from time to time. We also perform circuit design, circuit board layout, and strategic component sourcing at our Boston headquarters. Wherever the product is built, our quality systems are used to help assure that the product meets our specifications.
  
 Our North American facility is currently located in Tijuana, Mexico. From time to time we experience certain challenges associated with the Tijuana facility, specifically relating to bringing products across the border between the US and Mexico.   We believe that this facility assists us in cost-effectively providing rapid response to the needs of our US customers.
  
 Historically we have used one primary manufacturer for a given design. We sometimes maintain back-up production tooling at a second manufacturer for our highest-volume products. Our manufacturers are normally adequate to meet reasonable and properly planned production needs; but a fire, natural calamity, strike, financial problem, or other significant event at an assembler's facility could adversely affect our shipments and revenues. In 2016, one supplier provided 92% of our purchased inventory. The loss of a key supplier, or a material adverse change in a key supplier’s business or in our relationship with a key supplier, could materially and adversely harm our business.
  
 Our products include a large number of parts, most of which are available from multiple sources with varying lead times. However, most of our products include a sole-sourced chipset as the most critical component of the product. The vast majority of our cable and DSL modem chipsets come exclusively from Broadcom. Our dial-up modem chipsets come exclusively from Conexant. Serious problems at Broadcom or Conexant, including long chipset lead-times, would significantly reduce Zoom’s shipments.
  
 We have experienced delays in receiving shipments of modem chipsets in the past, and we may experience such delays in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure that a chipset supplier will, in the future, sell chipsets to us in quantities sufficient to meet our needs or that we will purchase the specified dollar amount of products necessary to receive concessions and incentives from a chipset supplier. An interruption in a chipset supplier's ability to deliver chipsets, a failure of our suppliers to produce chipset enhancements or new chipsets on a timely basis and at competitive prices, a material increase in the price of the chipsets, our failure to purchase a specified dollar amount of products or any other adverse change in our relationship with modem component suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 We are also subject to price fluctuations in our cost of goods. Our costs may increase if component shortages develop, lead-times stretch out, fuel costs rise, or significant delays develop due to labor-related issues.
  
 We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (“RoHS”) and Consumer Electronics Control (“CEC”) rules discussed above, which affect component sourcing, product manufacturing, sales, and marketing.
  
  Competition
  
 The Internet access and networking industries are intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive pricing practices, continually changing customer demand patterns, rapid technological advances, and emerging industry standards. These characteristics result in frequent introductions of new products with added capabilities and features, and continuous improvements in the relative functionality and price of modems and other communications products. Our operating results and our ability to compete could be adversely affected if we are unable to:
  
   ●
 successfully and accurately anticipate customer demand;

 
   ●
 manage our product transitions, inventory levels, and manufacturing processes efficiently;

 
   ●
 distribute or introduce our products quickly in response to customer demand and technological advances;

 
   ●
 differentiate our products from those of our competitors; or

 
   ●
 otherwise compete successfully in the markets for our products.

 
 Some of our primary competitors by product group include the following:
  
   ●
 Cable modem competitors: Arris, Belkin/Linksys, D-Link, Hon Hai Network Systems (formerly Ambit Microsystems), Netgear, Sagemcom, SMC Networks, Technicolor, TP-Link and Ubee Interactive.

 
   ●
 Dial-up modem competitors: Best Data, Hiro, Lite-On, Multitech, and US Robotics.

 
   ●
 DSL modem competitors: Arris, Actiontec, Asus, Aztech,, Belkin / Linksys, D-Link, Huawei, Netgear, Sagemcom (formerly Sagem), Siemens (formerly Efficient Networks), Technicolor, TP-Link, Westell, Xavi, and ZyXEL Communications.

 
   ●
 Mobile broadband competitors: Cradlepoint, D-Link, Huawei, Inseego, Multitech, Netcomm Wireless, Netgear, Nimbelink, Option, Sierra Wireless, and ZTE.

 
   ●
 Networking competitors: Amped, Apple, Asus, Belkin/Linksys,, D-Link, Eero, Google, Netgear, Securifi, Tenda, TP-Link, Trendnet, and Ubiquiti.

 
 Many of our competitors and potential competitors have more extensive financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do.
  
 The principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:
  
  
● product performance, features, reliability and quality of service;

 
  
● price;

 
  
 ● brand image;

 
  
● product availability and lead times;

 
  
● size and stability of operations;

 
  
● breadth of product line;

 
   
 
9


  
 
  
● sales and distribution capability, including retailer and distributor relationships;

 
  
● technical support and service;

 
  
● product documentation and product warranties;

 
  
● relationships with providers of broadband access services; and

 
  
● certifications evidencing compliance with various requirements.

 
 We believe we are able to provide a competitive mix of the above factors for our products, particularly when they are sold through retailers, computer product distributors, small to medium sized Internet service providers, and system integrators. We have been less successful in selling directly to large telephone companies and other large providers of broadband access services.
  
 Successfully penetrating the broadband modem market presents a number of challenges, including:
  
   ● the current limited retail market for broadband modems;
  
   ● the relatively small number of cable, telecommunications and Internet service providers that make up the majority of the market for broadband modems in the USA, our largest market;
  
   ● the significant bargaining power and market dominance of these large service providers;
  
   ● the time-consuming, expensive and uncertain certification processes of the various cable and DSL service providers; and
  
  ● the strong relationships with service providers enjoyed by some incumbent equipment providers, including ARRIS for cable modems and Huawei for DSL and mobile broadband modems.
  
  Intellectual Property Rights
  
 We rely primarily on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademarks and copyrights for our firmware (software on a chip), printed circuit board artwork, instructions, packaging, and literature. We also have five active patents that expire between years 2020 and 2031. We cannot assure that any patent application will be granted or that any patent obtained will provide protection or be of commercial benefit to us, or that the validity of a patent will not be challenged. Moreover, we cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop comparable or superior technologies.
  
 We license certain technologies used in our products, typically rights to bundled software, on a non-exclusive basis. In addition we purchase chipsets that incorporate sophisticated technology. We have received, and may receive in the future, infringement claims from third parties relating to our products and technologies. We investigate the validity of these claims and, if we believe the claims have merit, we respond through licensing or other appropriate actions. Certain of these past claims have related to technology included in modem chipsets. We forwarded these claims to the appropriate vendor. If we or our component manufacturers were unable to license necessary technology on a cost-effective basis, we could be prohibited from marketing products containing that technology, incur substantial costs in redesigning products incorporating that technology, or incur substantial costs defending any legal action taken against it. Where possible we attempt to receive patent indemnification from chipset suppliers and other appropriate suppliers, but the extent of this coverage varies and enforcement of this indemnification may be difficult and costly.
  
 In May 2015 we entered into an agreement to license certain Motorola® brand trademarks for consumer cable modem products in the US and Canada through certain authorized sales channels using such trademarks beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020. On August 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Motorola. The amendment expands our exclusive license to use the Motorola trademark to a wide range of authorized channels worldwide, and expands the license from cable modems and gateways to also include consumer routers, WiFi range extenders, home powerline network adapters and access ports.

  Backlog
  
 Our backlog on February 28, 2017 was $0.4 million, and on February 29, 2016 was $0.4 million. Many orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our net sales for any future period.
 Employees
  
 As of February 28, 2017, Zoom had 30 full-time and part-time employees. Ten employees were engaged in research and development and quality control. Five employees were involved in operations, which manages production, inventory, purchasing, warehousing, freight, invoicing, shipping, collections, and returns. Nine employees were engaged in sales, marketing, and customer support. The remaining six employees performed executive, accounting, administrative, and management information systems functions. Zoom currently has 25 full-time employees and 5 employees working less than 5 days per week, typically 4 days per week. Our dedicated personnel in Tijuana, Mexico are employees of our Mexican service provider and not included in our headcount. On February 28, 2017, Zoom had two consultants in sales and one consultant in information systems, none of whom are included in our headcount.
