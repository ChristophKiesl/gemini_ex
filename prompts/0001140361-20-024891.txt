Company History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 31, 2016 as Remaro Group Corp. Our principal executive offices are located at 8670 W. Cheyenne Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89129. Our telephone number is (888) 266-6370. Our website address is http://www.bnwhealth.com. Information contained in our website does not constitute any part of, and is not incorporated into, this prospectus.
 
On December 12, 2019, Marina Funt, the Company’s former principal shareholder, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director, consummated the sale of 8,000,000 pre-split shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”) to Boomer Natural Wellness, Inc. (“BNW”). The acquisition of the Shares, which represented approximately 76% of the Company’s shares of outstanding Common Stock, resulted in a change in control of the Company. In connection with the sale of the Shares, Ms. Funt waived, forgave and discharged any indebtedness of any kind owed to her by the Company.
 Also on December 12, 2019, in connection with the sale of the Shares, Daniel Capri was appointed a Director of the Registrant and, upon Ms. Funt’s resignation, was appointed to serve as the Registrant’s President, Treasurer and Secretary.
 
On January 7, 2020, the Company executed an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Share Exchange (the “Exchange Agreement”), with BNW, Boomer Naturals Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Boomer”), Boomer Naturals, Inc., and the shareholders of Boomer (the “Exchange”). Upon consummation of the transactions set forth in the Exchange Agreement (the “Closing”), the Company adopted the business plan of Boomer. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Boomer in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate 120,980,739 shares (the “Exchange Shares”) of the Company’s Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, BNW agreed to retire 24,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. As a result of the Exchange, Boomer became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and following the consummation of the Exchange, the shareholders of Boomer beneficially owned approximately Ninety-Four Percent (94%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company.
 
At the effective time of the Exchange, Michael Quaid was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Director and Thomas Ziemann as Chief Operating Officer and Director.

Description of Our Business
 
Boomer Botanics
 
We are engaged in the research, development, acquisition, licensing and sales of specialized natural products which have FDA compliant ingredients and are impactful on the endocannabinoid system. These products powered by natural terpenes, include, edible and topical offerings. We are engaged in marketing and branding within the alternative CBD/THC space, including our trademark “CB5” brand which is a proprietary formula and currently patent pending. Boomer Naturals currently operates a retail store in Las Vegas Nevada and is currently negotiating a lease on the company’s flagship store in Manhattan New York. Boomer Natural products are also available in Golf Pro Shops, Specialty Stores, Chiropractic Offices and Nail Salons across the country. Boomer Naturals has a robust online presence and enjoys material sales through its website at BoomerNaturals.com.
 
We believe our CB5 formula is an FDA-compliant formulation that fully supports the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS). CB5 combines five natural and powerful ingredients that target the ECS. The term FDA-compliant means that a company is selling a regulated food additive that is, or that its chemicals are, in compliance with the food additive provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. All of the ingredients in our CB5 formula are on the FDA Generally Recognized as Safe (“GRAS”) List which means they are deemed safe to use as an additive to food, beverages, and supplements without prior FDA review and approval.
 
Since our products do not contain any CBD or THC and all of our ingredients are on the FDA’s GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe List), Boomer Naturals is able to advertise on Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, YouTube, Instagram, and all national television networks. CBD and cannabis companies are not allowed to advertise on any of these channels. This allows Boomer Naturals to advertise creating brand recognition that our CBD competitors cannot. With many millions of people searching on the Internet monthly for CBD or CBD alternative products for pain, anxiety, inflammation, and sleep, being able to advertise is a huge advantage.
 
Boomer Naturals has obtained certificates of free sale to export our CB5 products to over 20 countries outside of the United States. The United States does not offer export certificates for CBD or THC products allowing Boomer Naturals to service the needs of the alternative wellness market globally. As of the date of this filing, Boomer Naturals has yet to sell its products in any country other than the United States.
 
The CB5 products were developed by neurosurgeon, Dr. Markus Chwajol https://boomernaturals.com/wellness-advisory-board/markus-chwajol/. The Boomer CB5 products contain a powerful combination of terpenes that interact with three known cannabinoid receptors and possibly a fourth, while the standard products in the industry interact only with one. Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in many plants that create their characteristic aroma. Terpenes may also offer some health benefits to the human body. Terpenes are found in basil, thyme, black pepper, hops, rosemary, lemongrass, jasmine, pine trees, cacao, and other plants and flowers. The product contains all-natural ingredients which are all listed on the Generally Recognized as Safe list of the Food and Drug Administration and was developed by a practicing brain surgeon who is an expert in natural ingredients and CB receptors.
 
 Boomer focuses on wellness solutions for the 50 and older age demographic through the development of products using the Boomer proprietary CB5 formula. The CB5 formula includes a variety of terpenes that are compliant with FDA guidelines as all ingredients are listed on the Generally Recognized as Safe list. The solutions include products that may alleviate pain, reduce anxiety, increase sleep quality, as well as offer cosmetic benefits. In addition, Boomer offers a full line of products to benefit the health of pets, including those suffering from seizures.

Boomer sells health and wellness products and services geared toward alleviating pain, anxiety and improving general wellness through our proprietary lines of CB5 products. CB5 formula is an FDA-compliant alternative that fully supports the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS). This revolutionary breakthrough combines five natural and powerful ingredients that target the ECS. Our product formulas are developed by our team of medical and scientific advisory board and are currently manufactured by FDA registered and GMP certified third-party contract manufacturers located in Florida.
 
Boomer Natural’s product lines include CB5, Golf CB5, Pet CB5, SKIN Sunscreen, and medical-grade skincare. Boomer’s most popular CB5 products are the AM, PM, and all-day tinctures and gummies as well as its pain relief roll-on.
 
These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has not reviewed or cleared any of our products nor has the FDA endorsed or verified any of our claims regarding our products. Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease and none of our products have been approved by the FDA for any purpose.
 
The Company’s initial wellness partners include Tommy Bahama and PGA of America (PGA Magazine). Boomer Naturals will attempt to leverage the brand recognition and customer loyalty of these top brands to elevate our brand to a leader in wellness.
 
On January 10, 2020, Boomer Naturals executed a Trademark License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Tommy Bahama Group, Inc. (“Tommy Bahama”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Oxford Industries, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Tommy Bahama agreed to license the Tommy Bahama trademark and other intellectual property from Tommy Bahama in connection with the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertisement and promotion of the Company’s products as more fully set forth in the License Agreement. The License Agreement requires the Company to pay minimum royalties for each license year and meet minimum net sales requirements of products under the licensed marks each year. The License Agreement may be terminated by Tommy Bahama before the end of the term for several reasons.
 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, Boomer Naturals is Tommy Bahama’s exclusive wellness licensed partner. Tommy Bahama recently placed its first order for approximately $400,000 of products from our CB5 line for people and pets. Boomer CB5 is the premier product for Tommy Bahama’s Friend and Family event scheduled for March 2020 with CB5 product placement at cash register countertops in both men’s and women’s departments. Tommy Bahama is expected to give our roll-on as a free gift with purchases during March and has ordered 19,000 roll-ons to give away at their largest retail event of the year. Also beginning in March, Tommy Bahama is expected to send emails to their database with offers from Boomer Naturals and posting offers on their social media platforms reaching approximately 500,000 followers.
 
Our Sales and Distribution Strategy
 
With our CB5 formula we believe are in a unique position to brand our line. Our FDA compliant product will give us access to advertising on national television and social media platforms like Facebook and Google. However, as a result of COVID-19 Pandemic, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase any retail sales of our CB5 products. Most of the stores that sell our CB5 products are non-essential retail stores so the ability to generate sales will be subject to these stores re-opening sufficiently in the near future and consequently remaining open, of which we can offer no predictions or assurances.
Online Sales
 
Through its websites and internet advertising, Boomer will be able to brand its products while informing consumers of the attributes of CB5. This direct to consumer interaction could pave the way for significant online sales through the Boomer Naturals website.

National Retail Chains.
 
As a result of the Pandemic, most non-essential retail stores were required to be closed since March 2020. Further many National Retail Chains are hesitant to introduce CBD related products on a national scale and thus far have only offered topical products in regional test markets. The FDA compliant ingredients in CB5 will allow these chains to offer Boomer Natural products in both topical and ingestible forms nation-wide.
Golf
 
As a result of the Pandemic, most golf courses and non-essential retail stores that sold golf-related products were required to be closed since March 2020. As stores reopen and items are phased in, we plan to continue to grow our distribution network in the golf space in part through our relationship with PGA Magazine and the PGA Merchandising Show. With access to vendors through these mediums and the ability to advertise we will be able to best utilize of our wide-ranging wholesale sales network. We are in a unique position to capture a significant share of the expansive golf market.
 
Overseas opportunities
 
Boomer has begun discussions with distributors in over 7 countries to carry the Boomer Naturals CB5 product line. These distributors see a unique opportunity to fulfill consumer demand via CB5 where CBD is not available to sell.
 
In addition, we intend to seek new branding and licensing opportunities for our intellectual property and we will seek strategic corporate and product acquisitions.
 
MARKET SIZE
 
According to the Global Wellness Institute, health and wellness is a multi-billion dollar industry and the trend is for consumers moving away from pharmaceuticals toward more natural solutions for everyday challenges. To meet this demand, Boomer Naturals created an all-natural doctor-formulated alternative to CBD, known as CB5. CB5 is a proprietary blend of botanical terpenes designed to restore balance to the ECS. Discovered in the early 1990s, the body’s ECS features cannabinoids and receptors (CB1, CB2, and two others yet to be named) that are some of the most abundant neurotransmitters found in the brain. The ECS supports and regulates several key systems and can help with issues relating to reducing pain and inflammation, balancing sleep/wake cycles, supporting the immune system, balancing mood, supporting a healthy metabolism, supporting reproductive health, and more. We believe CB5 is a more effective solution than CBD because it hits more receptors in the ECS with an entourage effect of many different plant terpenes.
 
According to Forbes, the projected market value of the CBD industry was expected to hit $20 billion by 2024. https://www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2019/05/20/cbd-market-could-reach-20billion-by-2024-says-

Boomer Medical Products
 
Upon most U.S. States issuing some level of Stay-At-Home orders arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the short-term business strategy of Boomer Naturals shifted. Boomer Naturals received its first round of Tommy Bahama orders during March 2020 and expected that Tommy Bahama would be reordering on a monthly basis to replenish stock at all of its brick and mortar retail locations. In addition, we believe Tommy Bahama intended to launch an aggressive e-commerce campaign commencing with email advertisements to its significant database of customers.
 
Once the Stay-At-Home orders took effect, Tommy Bahama was required to close its retail stores for several months and further elected to delay any major e-commerce marketing initiatives due to their belief that consumers were primarily spending money on food and other necessities as opposed to engaging in significant discretionary spending during the Pandemic. It would have been reasonably expected that said actions by Tommy Bahama would have caused a significant delay in revenues to the Company. However, management saw an opportunity to remain consistent with its health and wellness brand strategy by expanding its offerings to face coverings and other products within the Personal Protective Equipment category.
 
 Commencing in April 2020, Boomer Naturals began to offer for online retail sale at its website a variety of face coverings and sanitizers. During this period, Boomer Naturals began running advertisements on television, radio and various digital platforms featuring face coverings. Due to increased demand for these items, e-commerce sales grew to over 3,000 orders per day during the quarter ended July 31, 2020. This increased revenue stream was able to replace the anticipated revenue arising from the Tommy Bahama relationship. In addition, while the e-commerce PPE vertical continued to grow, Boomer Naturals began to receive some interest in wholesale purchases of face coverings and other protective equipment. Boomer Naturals is in the early-stages of growing a wholesale PPE division. While no assurance can be given regarding the performance of the Boomer Medical products division, the Company anticipates that this division will continue to generate revenues for the next three to six months to accompany the expected reemergence of the CB5 division upon Tommy Bahama retail stores reopening and increase overall brand awareness from the retail focused advertising campaign.


Recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-stores sales of the Company’s CB5 products have been completely reduced to zero and the Company’s planned openings of retail stores in New York and Chicago have been delayed indefinitely as well as potential tests in retail stores. The Company has shifted its focus to its Boomer Medical Supplies segment. Boomer Medical Supplies is focusing on the perceived opportunity created from the recent shift away from the reliance on Chinese-produced medical supplies. The Company has entered into an Exclusive Distributor Agreement with an unaffiliated third-party company located in Viet Nam (the “Supplier”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is the exclusive distributor of the supplier’s products in the United States The Company has established exclusive arrangements with non-Chinese medical supplies manufacturers mainly focusing on face coverings gloves, and gowns. provided the Company orders at least $3 million of inventory per year. The Supplier in turn has exclusive manufacturing agreements with certain manufacturers provide that the manufacturers will not sell these items to any other U.S. based customer provided that the Supplier orders an annual minimum of 1,500,000 masks from one manufacture and 750,000 masks from a second manufacturer, respectively. If the minimum amounts are not met, the agreements become non-exclusive for the U.S. market.
 
The Company is currently successfully selling a variety of face coverings and hand sanitizers to consumers online and through distribution to doctors, therapists, and wholesale brokers. As of the date of this annual report, the Company has been receiving more than 1,000 online orders per day for facemasks and hand sanitizers as well as a number of larger, wholesale orders.
 
 Boomer Naturals recently became an approved vendor for face coverings for a national retail chain with over 8,000 retail stores and has begun receiving and filling orders for this retailer in stores and online. The retailer and Boomer have executed a non-exclusive purchase order agreement for face coverings and the retailer has no obligation to purchase either a minimum unit or dollar amount of face coverings from the Issuer. To date, Boomer Naturals has received $6 million in orders from this retailer. Additionally, Boomer Naturals recently executed a purchaser order agreement with this retailer and its affiliate for approximately 5.4 million branded face coverings.

MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES
 
 As of the date of this Report, Boomer has eighty (80) full time employees. We believe we enjoy good employee relations. None of our employees are members of any labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
PROPERTIES
 
The Company does not own any physical location. Boomer currently leases its corporate headquarters and other offices in Las Vegas, Nevada which lease expires on September 20, 2027. We believe our current offices are sufficient in size for current and near term future operations.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
We believe we are in compliance with applicable federal, state and other regulations and that we have compliance programs in place to ensure compliance going forward. There are no regulatory notifications or actions pending.
 
Certain of our products are considered supplements and are regulated in the U.S. either as food or dietary supplements. The formulation manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale (hereafter, “sale” or “sold” may be used to signify all of these activities) of dietary supplements such as those sold by the Company are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, principally the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and to a lesser extent the Consumer Product Safety Commission and United States Department of Agriculture. The Company’s activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which the Company’s products are sold, as well as by governmental agencies in certain countries outside the United States in which the Company’s products are sold. Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product’s ability to provide health-related benefits.
 
Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease and desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress (for example, requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold to consumers), seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the dietary supplements industry, including the imposition by federal agencies of civil penalties in the millions of dollars against a few industry participants. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the Company operates will not change or that such regulatory environment, or any specific action taken against the Company, will not result in a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, increased sales of, and publicity about, dietary supplements may result in increased regulatory scrutiny of the dietary supplements industry.
 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”) was enacted in 1994, amending the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The Company believes DSHEA is generally favorable to consumers and to the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of “dietary supplements,” which includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary ingredients for human use to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients on the market as of October 15, 1994 do not require the submission by the manufacturer or distributor to the FDA of evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe, but a dietary ingredient which was not on the market as of October 15, 1994 may need to be the subject of such a submission to FDA at least 75 days before marketing. Among other things, DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as “food additives” and allows the use of statements of nutritional support on product labels. The FDA has issued proposed and final regulations in this area and indicates that further guidance and regulations are forthcoming. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient we may decide to use. The FDA’s refusal to accept such evidence could result in regulation of such dietary ingredients as food additives, requiring the FDA pre-approval based on newly conducted, costly safety testing.

Index
-----


Moreover, there can be no assurance that the FDA will not consider particular labeling statements used by us to be drug claims rather than acceptable statements of nutritional support, necessitating approval of a costly new drug application, or re-labeling to delete such statements. It is also possible that the FDA could allege false statements were submitted to it if structure/function claim notifications were either non-existent or so lacking in scientific support as to be plainly false.
 
The FDA has issued a proposal to regulate the sale of products containing the herb “ma huang” (also known as ephedra), a natural ingredient that contains a small percentage of ephedrine alkaloids. Various states and localities also have proposed or adopted restrictions on the sale of ephedra.
 
In November 1998, the FTC announced new advertising guidelines specifically for the dietary supplement industry, entitled “Dietary Supplements: An Advertising Guide for Industry.” These guidelines reiterate many of the policies the FTC has previously announced over the years, including requirements for substantiation of claims made in advertising about dietary supplements.
 
The FDA has announced its intent to issue proposed Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for the dietary supplement industry. The FDA has published the industry’s proposed GMP guidelines, but has not yet published its own proposed regulations for public comment.
 
The FTC regulates the marketing practices and advertising of all our products. In recent years, the FTC instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement companies for false and misleading marketing practices and advertising of certain products. These enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and monetary payments by the companies involved. Under FTC standards, the dissemination of any false advertising constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice actionable under Section 45 of the Fair Trade Commission Act and a false advertisement actionable under Section 52 of that Act. A false advertisement is one that is “misleading in a material respect.” In determining whether an advertisement or labeling information is misleading in a material respect, the FTC determines not only whether overt and implied representations are false but also whether the advertisement fails to reveal material facts. Under the FTC’s standards, any health benefit representation made in advertising must be backed by “competent and reliable scientific evidence” by which the FTC means: “tests, analyses, research studies, or other evidence based upon the expertise of professionals in the relevant area, that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted by the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.”
 
The FTC has increased its review of the use of the type of testimonials that may be used to market our products. The FTC requires competent and reliable evidence substantiating claims and testimonials at the time that such claims of health benefit are first made. The failure to have this evidence when product claims are first made violates the Federal Trade Commission Act. Although the FTC has never threatened an enforcement action against the Company for the advertising of its products, there can be no assurance that the FTC will not question the advertising for our products in the future.
 
We believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable government regulations. We cannot predict what new legislation or regulations governing our operations will be enacted by legislative bodies or promulgated by agencies that regulate its activities. The FDA is expected to increase its enforcement activity against dietary supplements that it considers to be in violation of FFD&CA. In particular, the FDA is increasing its enforcement of DSHEA provisions. Those activities will be enhanced by the appropriation for increased FDA budgets for dietary supplement regulation enforcement.
 
We believe we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA or other federal, state, or foreign regulatory authorities. We also believe the laws or regulations which are considered favorable may be repealed, or more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations may be implemented. Any or all of such requirements could be a burden to us. Future regulations could require us to:
 

• | change the way we conduct business;
--+------------------------------------


• | use expanded or different labeling;
--+------------------------------------


• | recall, reformulate or discontinue certain products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | keep additional records;

• | and/or

• | increase the scientific proof of product ingredients, safety, and/or usefulness.

The Company cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can it determine what effect such additional regulation, when and if it occurs, would have on its business in the future. Such additional regulation could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, revised, expanded or different labeling and/or additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
