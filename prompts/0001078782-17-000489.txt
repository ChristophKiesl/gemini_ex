ITEM 1. Business.
Current Mission Statement

Our mission is to build shareholder value through new business development within the parent Company and by maximizing the potential of the Company's movie theater holdings.
History

Our initial business began in 2000 with the formation of FullCircle Registry, Inc (FullCircle or the Company). At that time, FullCircle was a technology-based business that provided emergency document and health record retrieval services. 

The Companys records retrieval technology was sound, but our marketing strategy targeted individuals as our potential customers, not health-based companies. As the records and documents retrieval business model emerged, competitors seized upon the opportunity to provide retrieval services to businesses. As a result of these industry trends, the Companys individual-based records retrieval solution became unmarketable. 

The Company then initiated a series of new business models intended to provide value for the Companys shareholders. Since 2008, the Company has created four subsidiaries to focus on additional business opportunities in the distribution of insurance agency, prescription assistance services, medical supplies, and movie theater entertainment.

The FullCircle Registry website is www.fullcircleregistry.com, which has links to all SEC filings, updates on the theaters continued conversion to our new Dine-In Cinema LITE business model and information on the Companys other business developments.

FullCircle Insurance Agency, Inc.

In 2008, we established the wholly-owned subsidiary FullCircle Insurance Agency, Inc. for the purpose of assisting businesses and individuals acquire health insurance coverage. The Company never had more than one licensed insurance agent. Financial problems in the health insurance industry with AIG and other major industry players, along with uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act, led to the Companys decision to suspend business operations. This subsidiary was dissolved on March 6, 2017.
FullCircle Prescription Services, Inc.

Also in 2008, the wholly-owned subsidiary FullCircle Prescription Services, Inc. was established for the purpose of handling prescription assistance services programs. Its mission was to assist consumers in finding medications at discounted rates. As political trends evolved, largely influenced by large pharmaceutical companies, the re-importation of generic drugs manufactured by U.S. companies became disfavored by the U.S. Government. These industry changes led to the suspension of business and the dissolution of the subsidiary on March 6, 2017.
FullCircle Medical Supplies, Inc.

In 2013, we established the wholly-owned subsidiary FullCircle Medical Supplies, Inc for the purpose of entering into the durable medical equipment (DME) supply business sector. The expected business opportunity, acquiring medical supply businesses and other related medical supply services in the Sun Belt states, never materialized, leading to suspended operations and dissolution on March 6, 2017.
FullCircle Entertainment, Inc.

The Companys entertainment subsidiary, FullCircle Entertainment, Inc. (FullCircle Entertainment), was established in 2010 for the purpose of acquiring movie theaters and other entertainment venues. On December 31, 2010, FullCircle Entertainment purchased Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a fourteen-theater movie complex located on eight acres at 3898 Lafayette Road, Indianapolis, IN 46254 for a purchase price of $5.5 million. Currently, the operation of this theater (and the lease of a grocery store within the structure) is the Companys sole business and source of revenue.

Companys Financial Performance

As the Company suspended operations of all other subsidiaries, Company revenue became solely dependent upon FullCircle Entertainments theater business. Gross revenues declined from $1,497,813 in 2014, to $1,142,484 in 2015. Lower revenues impacted operations at Georgetown 14 Cinemas, including staffing and the maintenance of digital servers and projectors. By August, 2016, the theater had only 10 of 14 projectors in service, severely affecting our revenue potential. In September, 2016, new management quickly addressed badly needed projector repairs, placing two of the four inoperable digital projectors back in service by late Fall, FullCircle Entertainment ended 2016 with an uptrend in ticket sales, finishing 2016 with gross revenue of $1,087,650.
Movie Theater Competition

As the Company is currently dependent upon FullCircle Entertainment as its sole source of revenue, the ability of Georgetown 14 Cinemas to successfully attract and sustain customers is the Companys highest priority. The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive. Our theaters compete against regional and independent operators as well as the larger theater circuit operators. In addition to competition with other motion picture exhibitors, our theaters face competition from a number of alternative motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as cable television, satellite and pay-per-view services, Netflix and home video systems. The expansion of such delivery systems could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. We also compete for the publics leisure time and disposable income with all forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.

We believe that we enjoy a competitive advantage in that there are no competitive theaters within a 7.5 mile radius of our theater. In a five-mile radius of our theater, there are an estimated 240,000 wall-to-wall people, according to the 2010 census. No other theater location in Indianapolis has a comparable market area.

Dine-In Cinema LITE Business Model

In recent years, the movie theater business model has changed, responding to the need to attract customers who now have extensive home entertainment sources for watching theatrical films. Beginning in 2010, many U.S. theater companies started converting to enhanced food and beverage services. This transition to improved food offerings was quickly followed by theaters transforming their auditoriums to luxury reclining seating. In the Indianapolis area, the rapid growth of theater chain Studio Movie Grill has demonstrated the viability of offering new food choices, recliner seating and alcoholic beverage service. The Studio Movie Grill/College Park theater located at 3535 W. 86th Street, Indianapolis, IN achieved a 700% increase in annual food and beverage sales since their conversion to a dine-in cinema between October, 2013 and June, 2016 (Source: Rentrak). 

Recognizing the value of this new emerging business model, and the need to competitively reposition the theater, the Companys former CEO, Norman L. Frohreich, initiated a new strategic direction to convert Georgetown 14 Cinemas into an In-Theater Dining experience and replace the stadium seating with recliner lounge seating. The first phase of the transition plan was to convert the theaters smallest auditorium into a full-service kitchen and convert four auditoriums into luxury recliner seating and begin serving an expanded menu and beverages. Phase two called for the additional theaters to be converted to recliner seating, with the vision of converting all theaters over a period of a two years. Mr. Frohreichs financial projections called for an investment of approximately $1.5 million, and estimated that FullCircle Entertainment revenues could be increased to $2.7 to $3.0 million level in the first year after conversion, which would be more than double the theaters revenue at the time of the initial plan. Of course, these pro forma estimates depended on a number of assumptions.

Jon Findley began consulting with Mr. Frohreich in December, 2015 to assist in the development of the dine-in cinema business model. After Mr. Frohreichs unexpected death in August, 2016, the Board appointed Mr. Findley CEO and charged him with the responsibility of moving forward as quickly as possible to implement the new business strategy. By the end of 2016, Mr. Findley refocused the theaters transitional strategy to Dine-In Cinema LITE. 

The primary differences between the earlier conversion strategy and Dine-In Cinema LITE include:

·
 Smaller Kitchen. Construction of a smaller kitchen in existing space adjacent to the theater lobby, resulting in retention of the theater which had been planned to be taken out of service for the full-service restaurant kitchen envisioned as part of the initial plan. Our LITE model reduces capital funding requirements and maintains revenue from the retained theater.
 ·
 Smaller and More Affordable Food Menu. Many dine-in cinemas have opted to present a full-service restaurant menu with higher-priced fare. Our LITE model focuses on providing a more limited comfort food offering that is priced within a more acceptable range for our urban customers.

·
 Carry-In vs. In-Theater Service. Many dine-in cinemas have wait staff to take orders from customers inside the theater. Our LITE model reduces the high labor cost of having staff service customers in the same manner as a restaurant. Instead, our plan is similar to NFL food service, in which customers carry-in their own food items. We will also explore a modified plan to deliver food items to a central pickup location within each theater.
 ·
 Alcohol Service. We are waiting to add beer, wine and liquor until our new food service is firmly established. Our LITE model eliminates the separate bar area that many theaters have opted to build, which are largely unoccupied. Instead, our emphasis will be serving alcoholic beverages to our customers as part of their initial food and beverage order at the time tickets are purchased.
 ·
 Recliner Seating Rows. Instead of converting all theaters to luxury recliner seating, we will only convert a limited number of rows of our traditional stadium seating to recliners. Initially, recliner seating rows will only be added to our larger auditoriums. Once we achieve consistent sellout of these rows, we will add some additional rows of recliners. Our LITE model greatly reduces the cost of luxury recliner seating in two ways: 1) far fewer recliner chairs required to equip rows instead of full auditoriums, and 2) leasing instead of purchasing the recliner chairs. We plan to wait to add recliner seating until both food and alcoholic services are well established.

We believe our Dine-In Cinema LITE strategy is particularly well-suited to our urban location and the customers we serve. The Company is focused on proving that these new approaches to the movie theater industrys current in-theater dining models can be implemented in a manner which controls costs while still upgrading our revenue potential. We also see the opportunity to extend the LITE strategy to other urban markets based on future analysis of possible market expansion. Although the business model is somewhat different from that of Studio Movie Grill, we believe we can experience a similar robust growth as we implement our Dine-In Cinema LITE strategy.

Company Operations

Since September, 2016, the Companys CEO, Jon Findley, has directly supervised all financial and theater operations, principally from Indianapolis. Financial operations are managed by our CFO, Matthew Long, who works from the Companys headquarters in Shelbyville, KY. FullCircle Registry, Inc., and FullCircle Entertainment, Inc. have employee levels ranging between 20 to 28 employees/officers, depending on seasonal needs. We have never experienced employment-related work stoppages and focus on good relations with our personnel and are continuing to attract stronger talent.

Theater Operations

Our General Manager is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations staff, including cash management and deposits, film scheduling, technical projection operations, employee scheduling and training, food and beverage inventory management, supply and repair vendor management, IT systems, security, and grounds keeping. The Company is currently analyzing changes to the organizational structure that will strengthen theater management.

Typically, movie studios release films with the highest expected revenues during the summer and the holiday period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, causing seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Traditionally, our slow season is January through March, usually because of weather, and the period August through October. 

We obtain licenses to exhibit films by using a booking agent to negotiate directly with film distributors. Prior to negotiating for a film license, the booking agent evaluates the prospects for upcoming films, applying criteria such as cast, director, plot, and performance of similar films, estimated film rental costs and expected revenues, as well as the demographics of our market area. Because we only license a portion of newly released first-run films, our success in licensing depends greatly upon the availability of commercially popular motion pictures, and the preferences of patrons in our market and insight into trends in those preferences. In 2016, we changed booking agents in order to improve access to first-run releases as well as to schedule Spanish language films.

Theater revenues come from the sale of movie tickets and concessions, as well as special events. Most of the tickets we sell are sold at our theater box offices immediately before the start of a film. Patrons can also buy tickets in advance on our website and Fandango. For the year ended December 31, 2016, box office admissions and concession sales were 80.9% of total revenues. We license our movies from distributors generally owned by the major studios. In 2016, our film rental expense constituted 43% of our ticket sales, leaving only 57% for overhead and operating expenses.

Our theater business depends on consumers voluntarily spending discretionary funds on leisure activities. Movie theater attendance and concessions sales may be affected by any prolonged negative trends in the general economy that adversely affect consumer spending. During these negative economic conditions, our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases because of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies and other matters. This could result in a decrease in general consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to alternative forms of entertainment. Such factors could affect the demand for movies or severely impact the motion picture production industry, such that our business and operations could be adversely affected.

In the past, our concession stand was built around a limited menu, primarily focused on higher margin items such as popcorn, soft drinks, flavored popcorn, candy, frozen drinks, hot dogs and pretzels. The goal of our new food service is to upgrade food choices and increase food sales as a percentage of total revenue. Concession inventory is purchased from a local supplier. Our new culinary chef also provides food supplies for our expanded menu.

Marketing
 
The Georgetown 14 Digital Cinemas website is www.georgetowncinemas.com, which features up-to-date listings of all movie show times and the ability to pre-purchase tickets online. In October, 2016, the theater purchased approximately 19,000 emails for African-American households and approximately 7,000 emails for Latino households within a 10-mile radius of the theater. Since that time, we have sent a weekly email in both English and Spanish with news on theater improvements, special promotions, movie trailer links and links to purchasing tickets on the website. The theater also has a Facebook page with 2,000 likes which is used for special event marketing. The Company is reviewing additional marketing plans focused on social media, including Short Text Messaging to mobile phones.

We believe that it is important to build patron loyalty through enhancing the benefits received by attending our theater. We are finalizing our loyalty program where members earn points based on admissions and concessions purchases. Upon achieving designated point thresholds, members are eligible for specified awards, such as reduced price admission tickets and discounts on concession items.

Implementing New Operational and Strategic Plans

At the close of 2016, the Company was prioritizing the implementation of several strategies:

·
 The planned launch of our new Cinema Lounge food service, the first phase of our Dine-In Cinema LITE strategy, which has since been implemented. 
 ·
 New organizational structure to add senior staff positions as well as concession personnel. The theater has been running very lean during times of poor performance. The pace of increased ticket sales toward the end of 2016 has shown the need to add employees in order to assure quality of service.
 ·
 Repair of digital projector systems, which began in late 2016, has been completed. We once again have all 14 theaters back in operation after approximately three years of neglect due to limited financial resources. 
 ·
 The additional theaters have permitted resumed presentation of films from India as well as Spanish language versions of popular Hollywood films. Offering multi-language films and hosting multi-cultural events to target the local demographic is a key part of our future strategy.

We plan to offer updates to shareholders on the success of our Cinema Lounge food service as well as other strategic improvements on www.fullcircleregistry.com and through Press releases.

Past Sources of Funding 

Prior to 2010, when the Company created FullCircle Entertainment, the Companys funding came from sales of the Companys stock, loans from shareholders, loans form Board members/major shareholders and other debt secured by the Companys Board members/major shareholders as guarantors. 
On January 3rd, 2015, we issued a put for $100,000 to Kodiak Capital under our Stock Purchase Agreement with that firm. During the subsequent five-day trading period our stock dropped from $.0465 to $.0035. Consequently, the put price of our shares was lowered to $.00391, which provided only $47,500 in funding. Based on this difficult situation with the market price of our stock, and the effect of possible short selling activity, the Company refrained from further funding requests from Kodiak Capital. Our arrangement with Kodiak Capital expired on June 30, 2015.

In July, 2015, we entered into discussions with Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) for the purpose of receiving funding assistance for the business model change of our theater in Indianapolis. The funding from LISC never materialized. LISCs funding model focuses on helping build local communities by working with Community Development Corporations. Their various forms of funding include a limited number of grants, but are mostly debt instruments Combined with their general lending focus on working with community groups, not individual businesses, LISC proved not to be a good match for FullCircle Entertainment. Their review of our funding request determined that the Georgetown 14 Cinemas net revenues could not support an additional debt burden. However, there may be future opportunities to seek funding from LISC for specific purposes, such as a façade grant when FullCircle Entertainment is prepared to do exterior renovations to the Georgetown 14 Cinemas.

Present Sources of Funding 

In September 2016, the Companys new management was assigned the task of refining the theaters dine-in cinema business strategy. At that time, management determined that the Company needed to move quickly to turn around Georgetown 14 Cinemas and create a new direction that could excite and secure new sources of funding.

Previously, when FullCircle Entertainment experienced revenue shortfalls, the Companys issued stock to pay certain vendors for services in lieu of cash payments. Management has determined that using stock in lieu of cash for vendor services is a practice which needlessly dilutes current shareholder interests. 

Instead, management sought other sources of funding. Initially, the funding burden fell solely on the Companys founders and Board members, who once again stepped forward to provide funding in the form of loans represented by promissory notes. The Board has also assisted in presenting FullCircle Entertainments Round One investment proposal to individual promissory note investors, principally from Kentucky where the Company is headquartered. These promissory note investors receive 6.25% interest, compounded annually with interest to be paid quarterly. Payment of the interest on these promissory notes is a line item in FullCircle Entertainments budget, which is prioritized to provide timely interest payments to our investors. From September 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, FullCircle Entertainment received $91,942 in funding promissory notes from our founders and $50,000 from other individual investors located in Kentucky.

Future Sources of Funding

Our need for future funding sources has been greatly reduced from our previous projections requiring $1.5 million to complete the original concepts for our In-Theater Dining conversion. Our new Dine-In Cinema LITE concept will require approximately one-third of this projected capital. The savings from our new LITE model come from: 1) reducing the size of the planned kitchen to 25% of the initial plan (estimated cost $250,000), to a smaller space more the size of a large food truck (approximately $30,000), 2) retaining a theater that had previously been planned to be used for the larger kitchen, and retaining the revenues from that theater, 3) leasing, not purchasing, recliner seating, and 4) reducing the anticipated number of recliner seats by approximately 90%, with a strategy to install rows of recliners in selected theaters instead of completely changing out all current stadium seating.

While the new LITE concept reduces the Companys overall need for capital, our rapid rollout of this concept also increases our potential to use theater revenues to pay for improvements needed to complete the theater transition. The Company plans to use anticipated increased rising theater profits to both supplement planned improvements and to ensure that we meet our payment obligations to our note holders

FullCircle Entertainment is now preparing an updated investment proposal for additional individual promissory note investors. 
 In the future, the Company may also consider sales of Company stock if the market value of the Companys shares supports this strategy.

At this time, we have no contracts, agreements, or understandings for additional funding, nor can any assurance be given that we will be able to obtain this capital on acceptable terms. In such an event, this may have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Debt Management

As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately $1,306,300 in unsecured notes payable. The majority of our unsecured notes are with founders or shareholders of the Company. In the past, interest on these notes was accrued and no debt maintenance was performed. However, new management views the payment of current note interest, as well as payment of accrued note interest, to be one of the Companys most important financial obligations. The Company is reviewing a new pro forma which includes timely payment of current note interest.

At the end of 2016, we had a mortgage note of $4,373,001 for our property in Indianapolis and $242,450 in the outstanding balance on our digital equipment note, both of which are secured debts. In 2016, the Company successfully renegotiated the payment structure of these debts, as described in Mortgage Expense Reduction. below.

Failure to acceptably manage our amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:

·
 Increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
 ·
 Result in an event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations with our mortgage;
 ·
 Require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our mortgage indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
 ·
 Increase our cost of borrowing;
 ·
 Restrict us from implementing strategic improvements;
 ·
 Limit our ability to service our indebtedness;
 ·
 Limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general corporate purposes; and
 ·
 Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less highly leveraged competitors who may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.

Mortgage Expense Reduction

In January, 2012, FullCircle Entertainment converted all of its screens to a digital format and installed 3D capability at a cost of $790,000, which we financed with a secured loan. Monthly payments for this equipment loan were $11,410. 

Later in 2012, FullCircle Entertainment renegotiated the property mortgage assumed when the Company acquired the Georgetown 14 Cinemas, resulting in a reduction of 3/4 percentage point in the interest rate. In March, 2013, we again renegotiated the mortgage, resulting in a further reduction of 1/4 percentage point. As a result, the combined monthly property and equipment mortgage payment was reduced to $46,094.

On July 31, 2015, we entered into a change in terms agreement with our lender whereby our lender agreed to modify our payment schedule from a monthly fixed principal and interest payment in the amount of $34,435 to interest-only payments of $17,310 beginning with payment due date of June 15, 2015 thru November 15, 2015. The normal payment of principal and interest of $34,435 was to resume on December 15, 2015. 

In late 2015, both the property mortgage and the equipment mortgage were transferred to another lender, Kirkland Financial. Due to the continued declined in revenues, FullCircle Entertainment was unable to resume principal and interest payments as had been agreed with the previous lender. Interest-only payments were made in December, 2015 as well as January and February, 2016. Beginning in March, 2016, the company was unable to make the interest-only payments on the property mortgage, but continued to pay the full principal and interest on the equipment loan. 
 
Delinquent property mortgage payments continued to accrue until September, 2016. After Jon Findley was appointed as the Companys CEO, filling the vacancy caused by the sudden passing of Norman Frohreich, the Companys former CEO, renegotiation of the Kirkland Financial property mortgage was determined to be a high priority. To demonstrate good faith, interest-only payments were resumed in September, 2016. Findley began negotiations with Kirkland Financial in mid-October, requesting that Kirkland Financial combine both the property mortgage and the equipment note into a more affordable single monthly payment. Prior to the end of December, Kirkland Financial responded with a restructured finance agreement which reduced the combined property and equipment note monthly payment from $46,094 to $15,222. The new mortgage has a balloon payment of all unpaid principal and interest on July 15, 2020. Finally, after the theater is again cash flowing to expectations, the Company will refinance the mortgage to maintain an acceptable monthly payment.

Proposed and Potential Sale of Property

In connection with the restructuring, a property appraisal of both the leased property and the theater property was obtained. The appraisal estimated the value of our 40,910 square-foot theater building at $2,850,000 and the 18,000 square-foot leased property at $1,450,000. The Company has completed a survey in preparation for the sale of the leased property and is discussing terms of sale with several potential buyers.

It is the Companys firm intent to sell the 18,000 square-foot leased property in 2017, with a target sales price of $1,200,000, and is currently classified as an asset held for sale net of estimated selling costs.

In February, 2016 we received a Letter of Intent from a real estate developer for an option to purchase a portion of the south end of our parking lot for a proposed mixed-use building, housing retail shops and apartments. At this time, the developer is engaged in preliminary site planning and a pro forma. If this purchase for the development moves forward, it will provide some working capital, or shared leasing revenue, and may improve the value of our remaining property. The area being discussed is about one acre in size.

Taxes 

Over the past two years, the Company successfully appealed the assessed taxable value of the Companys real and personal property. However, limited cash flows led to failure to make timely payments of the Companys real and personal property taxes owed. New management arranged a monthly payment plan with the Marion County Tax Assessor to bring past tax payments current. The remaining portion of the delinquent property tax payments were paid in full subsequent to December 31, 2016.
