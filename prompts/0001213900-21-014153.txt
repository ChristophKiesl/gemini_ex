Corporate History
 
Effective March 31, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), we completed a merger with Recruiter.com, Inc. (“Pre-Merger Recruiter.com”), an affiliate of the Company, pursuant to a Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 31, 2019 (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger, our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary merged with and into Recruiter.com, with Recruiter.com continuing as the surviving corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary. As consideration in the Merger, the equity holders of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com received a total of 775,000 shares of our newly designated Series E convertible preferred stock (“Series E Preferred Stock”) convertible into approximately 9,687,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”). As a result, the former stockholders of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com controlled approximately 90% of our outstanding Common Stock and in excess of 50% of the total voting power of the Company.
 
Following the Merger, on May 9, 2019, we changed our corporate name to Recruiter.com Group, Inc. Our fiscal year end was also changed, as of the Effective Date, from March 31 to December 31.
 
Immediately prior to the completion of the Merger, Pre-Merger Recruiter.com owned approximately 98% of our outstanding Common Stock. The Merger did not result in a change of control of our Company, as the principal stockholders of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com had controlled the Company since October 2017 and the Merger simply increased their control. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer served as the Chief Executive Officer of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com and the majority of our directors were directors (or designees) prior to the Merger. Further, our Executive Chairman was retained as a consultant prior to the Merger with the understanding that if the Merger occurred, he would be appointed Executive Chairman of the Company.
 
Prior to the completion of the Merger, Pre-Merger Recruiter.com distributed to its stockholders the 1,562,500 shares of our Common Stock that it had previously acquired as consideration pursuant to the license agreement with us. See “Part III. Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions – Recruiter.com License” for further information.

For accounting purposes, the Merger was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com and combination of entities under common control (“recapitalization”) with Pre-Merger Recruiter.com considered the accounting acquirer and historical issuer. Our consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com. Since Pre-Merger Recruiter.com owned a majority interest in the Company prior to the completion of the Merger, the consolidated financial statements contained herein include the historical operations of the Company and VocaWorks, Inc., (“VocaWorks”), the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. All share and per share data in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of the Merger.
 
Genesys Asset Purchase
 
Effective March 31, 2019, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities under an asset purchase agreement, dated March 31, 2019, among the Company, Genesys Talent LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Genesys”), and Recruiter.com Recruiting Solutions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Asset Purchase”). As consideration in the Asset Purchase, Genesys received a total of 200,000 shares of our newly designated Series F convertible preferred stock (the “Series F Preferred Stock”) convertible into approximately 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock. The acquired assets and liabilities include certain accounts receivable, accounts payable, deferred revenue, sales and client relationships, contracts, intellectual property, partnership and vendor agreements and certain other assets. The Company is utilizing these assets in its employment staffing business operated through Recruiter.com Recruiting Solutions, LLC (“Recruiting Solutions”). This transaction was treated as a business combination for accounting purposes.
Reverse Stock Split
 
In August of 2019, we effected a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-80 (the “2019 Reverse Stock Split”). The number of shares and price per share information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect the effect of the 2019 Reverse Stock Split.
OneWire Asset Purchase
 
On December 22, 2020, we announced that we entered into a binding letter of intent (the “OneWire LOI”) to acquire Onewire, Inc. (“Onewire”), a leading SaaS-based recruiting and software platform focused on the financial services sector. The acquisition will include the OneWire SaaS hiring platform and job site (www.onewire.com), Matchbook software (www.matchbook.io), a tool for curating and presenting screened and vetted talent which OneWire developed, and Onewire’s executive search business. While the definitive agreement is currently in the process of being negotiated, the OneWire LOI provides for up to a $1.255 million purchase price. The Company will pay the entire purchase price in shares of Common Stock with a portion of the purchase price to be paid on the basis of a earn-out following the completion of an audit of OneWire’s financial statements. 
Scouted Asset Purchase
 
Effective January 31, 2021, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired all assets of RLJ Talent Consulting, Inc., dba Scouted, a Delaware corporation (“Scouted”) (the “Scouted Asset Purchase”). As consideration in the Scouted Asset Purchase, Scouted shareholders will receive a total of 514,666 shares of our restricted common stock (valued at $1,441,065 based on a $2.80 per share grant date price), of which 76,113 shares of stock will be held in reserve, and an additional amount of $180,000 in cash consideration for a total purchase price of approximately $1.6 million. The Scouted Asset Purchase will be accounted for as a business acquisition. The assets acquired in the Scouted Asset Purchase consist primarily of sales and client relationships, contracts, intellectual property, partnership and vendor agreements and certain other assets (the “Scouted Assets”), along with a de minimis amount of other assets. The Company will complete the purchase price allocation of the $1.6 million for the acquired intangible assets during 2021. . The Company is utilizing the Scouted Assets to expand its video hiring solutions and curated talent solutions, through its Recruiting Solutions subsidiary. 
Market Opportunity
 
Industry Overview
 
According to the U.S. Staffing Industry Forecast, published in July 2020 by Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”), the total recruiting and staffing revenue for 2020 is projected to be $126.1 billion; an increase from SIA’s April 2020 forecast, which predicted $119.4 billion in revenue. For 2021, SIA also projected double-digit growth of 11% in temporary staffing revenue and a 19% overall expansion in the placement and employment search market.
 
This total industry market size includes companies that help other organizations find staff on a temporary or permanent basis, with the temporary staffing segment being significantly larger. The need for qualified and, in many cases, highly specialized talent, can be fulfilled by assisting companies in recruiting new internal staff or directly providing temporary staff to fill specific functions.

Overall, the U.S. recruitment industry is enormous, and it continues to grow, driven mainly by robust GDP growth creating demand for both direct-hire and contingent (project-based) workers. Demographic trends are also accelerating the demand for recruitment services: According to Seniorliving.org, approximately 10,000 persons from the “Baby-Boomer Generation” will retire each day in 2020, and employers often turn to the recruiting industry to close these talent gaps. Overall corporate spending in recruiting technology continues to grow, expected to surpass $10 billion by 2022, according to Jason Corsello, General Partner of Acadian Ventures.
 
In light of this market potential, the appetite for on-demand recruiting and talent acquisition technology companies has been robust. According to a “Recruitment Software Market Forecast and Analysis 2020-2024” published by Technavio, the global recruitment software market will expand by $683.8 million during 2020-2024. The same report details that even amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the global recruitment software market registered a YOY growth of 4.74% in 2020, with the market estimated to expand at a CAGR of over 5% during the forecast period of 2020-2024.
 
With employers continuing to struggle to find relevant candidates and more than 6.6 million open jobs in the US as of December 2020 according to the Job Opening and Labor Turnover report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics published on February 9, 2021, recruiting represents an enormous market opportunity. According to the leading human resource association, the Society for Human Resource Management, external sources—whether online job boards, recruiting agencies, campus events, job fairs, or walk-ins—produce approximately 62% of interviews compared to internal sources such as career sites, in-house recruiters and employee referrals (38%). This 62% of role interviews generated by external sources provide a significant market opportunity for innovative recruiting technology companies to capture.

Industry Trends
 
COVID-19 
 
The recent COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic effect on the US economy and the job market. Unemployment peaked at 14.7% in April of 2020. Since then, labor markets have been continually improving, with the unemployment rate falling to 6.7% in January 2021. The Federal Reserve forecasts that the unemployment rate will continue to fall, reaching 5% in 2021. The Federal Reserve anticipates improved employment for the coming years, with the unemployment rate dropping to 3.7% by 2023.
 
Our management team believes that COVID-19 accelerated major technology trends that had already existed before the pandemic. For example, the growth of the gig economy (i.e. temporary, flexible jobs) was facilitated by technology, virtual and remote tele-work with video and the emergence of on-demand labor through online marketplaces all happened before the crisis. The necessity of lockdowns and business closures drove increased technology adoption and moved these trends rapidly forward. As we operate as virtual, AI and video-based hiring platform operating in the gig economy, these trends may act as headwinds for the adoption of our products and services.

Recruiting Outsourcing
 
We provide through our on-demand platform a form of recruiting outsourcing for employers. By using our services, employers are effectively relieving their human resources departments of the costs and labor associated with recruitment and talent acquisition. The current economic climate may move more companies to increase their use of such outsourcing. For example, a report from Brandon Gaille issued in May 2017 found that, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, a majority of employers (57%) increased their use of outsourcing, with only a small percent (9%) of employers ending such outsourcing arrangements. Recruitment outsourcing promises cost-effective and efficient process improvements, and employers may again increase their use of outsourcing to navigate the current environment.
 
The use of recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) is accelerating. According to its report, “Global Recruitment Process Outsourcing Industry,” Reportlinker projects that the RPO industry will reach a revised size of $14.4 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 13.8%, with the current U.S. Market estimated at $1.7 billion. We offer two forms of recruitment process outsourcing through the performance -based hiring solution of its job market platform, which allows employers to pay for successful hires and its Recruiter.com On Demand offering, which enables businesses to engage recruiters on a flexible project or hourly basis. We additionally have active RPO customers, for which we provide on-demand recruiting labor.

Online Talent Platforms
 
According to a study developed by the McKinsey Global Institute, online talent platforms are the future of hiring and could add $2.7 trillion, or 2.0 percent, to global GDP by 2025. The firm projected that 10 percent of the worldwide labor force, or 540 million people, could benefit in various ways from online talent platforms by 2025. There is growth in demand for both remote workers and outside consultants. Overall, in 2020, IBISWorld estimates the number of temporary employees will increase by 1.8%. Online talent marketplaces, such as Recruiter.com, may benefit as a result.
 
McKinsey’s Future of Work in America report states: “In a more technology-driven world, job-matching efforts can be aided by a range of new digital tools and should run on easily accessible digital platforms. New online tools can assess an individual’s skills, suggest appropriate career choices, and clarify which jobs are in demand and the credentials needed to obtain them.” There is a clear need for efficient technology platforms that can adapt to rapidly changing job demands, such as ours.
 
Again, the current economic climate and COIVD-19 may have accelerated these technology trends. During the recent COVID-19 epidemic, D’Arcy Coolican and Jeff Jordan of famed venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz stated in an article entitled “COVID-19 and the Great Re-Hiring” that “If there was ever a time to start a specialized jobs platform, it’s now.”
 
Operating Businesses and Revenue
 
The Company has four wholly-owned and active subsidiaries: Recruiter.com, Inc., Recruiter.com Recruiting Solutions LLC (“Recruiting Solutions”), Recruiter.com Consulting, LLC, VocaWorks, Inc. (“VocaWorks”) and Recruiter.com Scouted, Inc. (“Scouted”). As of March 5, 2020, the Company employed 270 employees in 19 states.
 
We generate revenue from the following activities:
 

● | Consulting and Staffing: Consists of providing consulting and staffing personnel services to employers to satisfy their demand for long- and short-term consulting and temporary employee needs. We generate revenue by first referring qualified personnel for the employer’s specific talent needs, then placing that personnel with the employer, but with us or our providers acting as the employer of record, and finally, billing the employer for the time and work of our placed personnel on an ongoing basis. Our process for finding candidates for consulting and staffing engagements largely mirrors our process for fulltime placement hiring. This process includes employers informing us of open consulting and temporary staffing opportunities and projects, sourcing qualified candidates through our Platform and other similar means, and, finally, the employer selecting our candidates for placement after a process of review and selection. We bill these employer clients for our placed candidates’ ongoing work at an agreed-upon, time-based rate, typically on a weekly schedule of invoicing.

● | Fulltime Placement: Consists of providing referrals of qualified candidates to employers to hire staff for full-time positions. We generate fulltime placement revenue by earning one-time fees for each time that employers hire one of the candidates that we refer. Employers alert us of their hiring needs through our Platform or other communications. We source qualified candidate referrals for the employers’ available jobs through independent recruiter users that access our Platform and other tools. We support and supplement the independent recruiters’ efforts with dedicated internal employees we call our internal talent delivery team. Our talent delivery team selects and delivers candidate profiles and resumes to our employer clients for their review and ultimate selection. Upon the employer hiring one or more of our candidate referrals, we earn a “fulltime placement fee”, an amount separately negotiated with each employer client. The full-time placement fee is typically either a percentage of the referred candidates’ first year’s base salary or an agreed-upon flat fee.

● | Recruiters on Demand: Consists of a consulting and staffing service specifically for the placement of professional recruiters, which we market as Recruiters on Demand. Recruiters on Demand is a flexible, time-based solution that provides businesses of all sizes access to recruiters on an outsourced, virtual basis for help with their hiring needs. As with other consulting and staffing solutions, we procure for our employer clients qualified professional recruiters, and then place them on assignment with our employer clients. Revenue earned through Recruiters on Demand is derived by billing the employer clients for the placed recruiters’ ongoing work at an agreed-upon, time-based rate. We directly source recruiter candidates from our network of recruiters on the Platform, as the recruiter user base of our Platform has the proper skill-set for recruiting and hiring projects. We had previously referred to this service in our revenue disaggregation disclosure in our consolidated financial statements as license and other, but on July 1, 2020, we rebranded as Recruiters on Demand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Career Solutions: We provide services to assist job seekers with their career advancement. These services include a resume distribution service which involves promoting these job seekers’ profiles and resumes to assist with their procuring employment, and upskilling and training. Our resume distribution service allows a job seeker to upload his/her resume to our database, which we then distribute to our network of recruiters on the Platform. We earn revenue from a one-time flat fee for this service. We also offer a recruiter certification program which encompasses our recruitment related training content, which we make accessible through our online learning management system. Customers of the recruiter certification program use a self-managed system to navigate through a digital course of study. Upon completion of the program, we issue a certificate of completion and make available a digital badge to certify their achievement for display on their online recruiter profile on the Platform. For approximately the four months following March 31, 2020, the Company provided the recruiter certification program free in response to COVID-19. We partner with Careerdash, a high-quality training company, to provide Recruiter.com Academy, an immersive training experience for career changers.

● | Marketplace Solutions: Our Marketplace Solutions, previously referred to as Marketing Solutions, allow companies to promote their unique brands on our website, the Platform, and our other business-related content and communication. This is accomplished through various forms of online advertising, including sponsorship of digital newsletters, online content promotion, social media distribution, banner advertising, and other branded electronic communications, such as in our quarterly digital publication on recruiting trends and issues. Customers who purchase our Marketplace Solutions typically specialize in B2B software and other platform companies that focus on recruitment and Human Resources processing. We earn revenue as we complete agreed upon marketing related deliverables and milestones using pricing and terms set by mutual agreement with the customer. In addition to its work with direct clients, the Company categorizes all online advertising and affiliate marketing revenue as Marketplace Solutions.

The costs of our revenue primarily consist of employee costs, third-party staffing costs and other fees, outsourced recruiter fees and commissions based on a percentage of Recruiting Solutions gross margin.
 
Our results of operations and financial condition may be impacted positively and negatively by certain general macroeconomic and industry wide conditions, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The consequences of the pandemic and impact on the U.S. and global economies continue to evolve and the full extent of the impact is uncertain as of the date of this filing. The pandemic has had a detrimental effect on many recruitment technology companies and on the general employment and staffing industry. If the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is not robust, the impact could be prolonged and severe. We have reduced certain billing rates to respond to the current economic climate. Additionally, while we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a loss of clients as the result of the pandemic, we expect that the impact of such attrition would be mitigated by the addition of new clients resulting from our continued efforts to adjust the Company’s operations to meet the demands of the greater recruitment industry. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will further impact our operations, ability to obtain financing or future financial results is uncertain at this time. As a result of COVID-19, the Company took steps to streamline certain expenses, including temporarily cutting certain executive compensation packages by approximately 20%. Management also worked to reduce unnecessary marketing expenditures and worked to improve staff and human capital expenditures, while maintaining overall workforce levels. The Company does not expect reductions made in Q2 2020 due to COVID-19 to inhibit its ability to meet client demand. Overall, management is focused on effectively positioning the Company for a rebound in hiring, which we expect to occur in 2021. Ultimately, the recovery may be delayed and the economic conditions may worsen. The Company continues to closely monitor the confidence of its recruiter users and customers, and their respective job requirement load through offline discussions and the Company’s Recruiter Index survey, which surveys recruiters’ sentiment on the job market and demand for recruiting services.
 
Disrupting an Industry - Recruit Talent Faster
 
We believe we are fundamentally modernizing the recruiting process by digitizing and democratizing the recruiting process. We are distributing both the work and opportunity of recruiting to a broader community than ever before, enabling people to earn money through our platform and be their own bosses. Furthermore, we are dispersing the economic benefits of successful recruitment to a broad group of people and, by doing so, we help businesses recruit talent faster and more efficiently than ever before.
Community and Network
 
Our network currently consists of over 28,000 small and independent recruiters. This virtual network of recruiters unite under our innovative web platform that offers earnings opportunities through successful job matching; access to matched candidates driven by artificial intelligence; and on-demand, project-based recruiting assignments.
 

The community or network of recruiters is additionally categorized into virtual teams based on industry vertical, skill or location specialization, and dedicated client resource teams. Through participation in a virtual team, recruiters may receive further job and account updates, personalized recommendations, exclusive job opportunities, and recommended candidate referrals. We operate these teams through its platform and facilitate real-time communication through parallel chat rooms managed by our internal community managers.

We believe the potential scale of our recruiting community is enormous. Similar to how Uber created the opportunity for anyone to become a taxi driver, we make it possible for anyone to become a recruiter. The American Staffing Association cites about 25,000 staffing and recruiting companies, which altogether operate around 49,000 offices, so the recruiting industry’s contribution to employment is significant. However, we enable a broader disruption of the industry, bringing the opportunities to a much broader group of people than previously possible. Through upskilling and engagement with our recruiter users, we make it easier for anyone to get involved in recruiting. With hundreds of thousands of people involved in the general human resource and employment industry in the U.S. alone, and many more interested in referral-based, work-from-home earning opportunities, we believe our addressable network and potential audience is vast.
 
The Recruiter.com Website - a Top Destination
 
Our website is a popular destination for the recruiting and talent acquisition profession, with millions of pages of indexed content on career and recruitment issues and trends, email newsletters, and digital publications issued every quarter. Our internet traffic is generated by three primary groups of people: (1) recruiters seeking to join the network and platform, (2) enterprises seeking to recruit talent, and (3) candidates seeking to find opportunities through the community of recruiters. Overall, we are a well-known brand in the recruiting industry, and our vision is to build upon this success to become a clear leader in terms of traffic, mindshare, and usage within the business of recruiting.
 
A comprehensive search engine optimization strategy fuels our marketing. SpyFu.com, a traffic analysis website, estimated that, as of January 2021, our website has obtained over 4,952 search terms on the first page of Google.com, resulting in an estimated click value of $4.14 million per month, which is estimated by calculating the price of the Company’s organic traffic, were it to buy that traffic from paid search engine listings, such as on Google.com. We also expanded our reach through social media as we are active on Twitter and Facebook, with almost 50,000 followers on Twitter. Most notably, as of January 2021, we operated four of the top ten largest professional groups in the world on the social media platform LinkedIn, out of over 1.8 million groups in total. One of our groups, The Recruiter.com Network group on LinkedIn, has over 825,000 members.
 
In addition to our online thought leadership and social media presence, we also attract recruiters and enterprises to our community and solution through our recruitment training offering. Through our fully online Recruiter.com Certification Program (RCP) and Recruiter.com Academy, a live, instructor-led program with CareerDash, we facilitate upskilling for experienced recruiters and easy entry into the profession for those new to the tasks of recruiting and candidate sourcing. The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) has certified the RCP for re-education credits and Recruiter.com intends to pursue similar accreditation for the Recruiter.com Academy program. After completing the RCP course through an integrated online learning management system, we grant our users a certification and badge on their unique online Recruiter.com profiles.
 
COVID-19 Implications
 
We are creating a highly collaborative and connected global platform for professional recruiting, with the goal of becoming the top-of-mind solution for hiring talent rapidly. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. was in an incredibly tight job market, with the demand for talent at its highest levels in years. Now, with millions of people out of work due to COVID-19 set to return to the job market over the next few years, we believe businesses across the country must prepare to reopen or ramp up operations once again. We also believe these businesses will need efficient ways to tap the massive talent pool resulting from the millions of Americans who are currently unemployed or looking for better opportunities in new industries and companies. We believe that on-demand recruiting technology companies like ours, which generate revenue not from the overall consistency of employment levels but rather from movement within labor markets (i.e., job turnover), will benefit from this development. By combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with a unified network of more than 28,000 recruiters, we have built what we believe to be the most efficient recruiting network in the world — and we are hoping to use our network to help get the US economy working again.
 
We believe we have the reach, technology, recruiting expertise, and the scalability to connect employers across verticals with the right talent at the right price — no matter where that talent is today. Our mission is clear: to help enable the great re-hiring. We will leverage our growing community and expanding platform to get talented people to return to work as fast as possible, connecting people and creating economic opportunities.
 
Our Job Market Platform
 
Our virtual AI- and video-enabled hiring platform (the “Platform”), which is accessible on our website, Recruiter.com, provides access to over 28,000 small and independent recruiters. The Platform enables our clients, both employers and recruiters, to access the scalable on-demand sourcing power of an extensive network of independent recruiters, with the account management and personalized talent delivery of a full-service recruitment services firm. The Platform can be used by employers on a stand-alone basis or can be integrated with platforms operated by vendor management services (“VMS”), managed service providers (“MSP”) or payroll solutions providers to import open jobs into the Platform. Employers may use the Platform to enter job descriptions and learn about qualified applicants, while independent recruiters may submit their candidates, track the status of those candidates, and view statistics associated with the hiring process, such as number of applicants, interviews, and status of a particular candidate.

Our people, platform, and power help us recruit talent faster for employers across the country.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We seek to unlock the full potential of our brand by executing its strategic plans, which include organic growth, opportunistic acquisitions, and making use of the capital markets provided by the public market. In short, we look to realize the potential of our market position.
Overall Market Position Potential
 
Companies in the recruiting technology space, such as LinkedIn and Indeed.com, have achieved “unicorn” status as billion-dollar companies. Management believes that our full potential could lead to our achieving a much larger market position and presence, as Recruiter.com is a defining brand for the profession of recruiters. Recruiting as a business generates over $125 billion in revenue, therefore management believes there to be a very large addressable market and opportunities for growth.
 
Our combination of innovative candidate-matching technology, a broad network of specialized recruiting professionals, and curated talent communities enable a traditionally service-heavy industry to be scalable in an entirely new way. The traditional recruitment and staffing industry is dominated by industry roll-ups in the public markets. We believe our brand and platform position us to capitalize on M&A opportunities, enabling further overall growth and consolidation.

Strategy
 
Recruiter.com intends to grow its business by focusing efforts on the following five main areas:
 
1) Grow Our Community:
 

● | Grow Recruiter Engagement: Dedicated Community Managers regularly support and service our growing network of independent recruiter users on our platform. We plan to continue to invest in community management initiatives, including enhancement of outreach, communications, reward programs, and training of our Community Managers. We have introduced the concept of Recruiter Rewards, which allows members of our network to earn points, redeemable for merchandise we source, for performing specific actions on the platform. We intend to continue to develop this program, increasing engagement, and earning potential on the platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grow the Number of Recruiters on our Platform: We plan to continue to grow our recruiter network through viral search, referral, content, and community strategy. Investments in content, community sponsorship and thought leadership will continue to drive people back to the platform, creating a real “hub” for recruiters.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase Growth and Earning Opportunities for Recruiters on Our Platform: We plan to continue investing in new products and features to help recruiters grow their businesses by expanding their access to technology, developing their professional and marketing skills, and increasing their earning opportunities. This includes expanding on our lead generation capabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Build Business Model Innovations:
 

● | Continue to Innovate and Improve Our Platform to Build Best-in-Class User Experiences: We aim to create the most innovative and easy-to-use solutions for empowering businesses and recruiters to recruit talent faster. For example, we recently launched an improvement to our candidate submittal process, which allowed for bulk sharing and distribution of referral links to candidates through social media. We will strive to continually incorporate such advances into our platform, taking into consideration user feedback.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest in Scalable Business Models: We plan to continue to invest in the development of our SaaS model and subscription services while improving recruiter experience by enhancing our software capabilities, data science, security, and technology infrastructure. Further low- and light-touch subscription models and plans promise to facilitate the seamless transactions of candidate and job flows on our platform and, in doing so, increase our gross margins and the efficiency of our business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leverage Our Platform to Launch New Products: We believe we can continue to innovate to solve complex challenges involving recruitment and hiring, and we plan to use our highly extensible platform to support the introduction of additional products and services. Our massive network, leading technology, and recruiting expertise allow us to introduce new features and incorporate feedback into such features with speed, efficiency, and scale.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest in Advanced Technologies, Including Artificial Intelligence: We believe that recruiting is about people, and people will always drive the hiring process, so long as our current system of employment and human labor exists. Existing technologies cannot supplant human review and involvement in most hiring transactions, including all four stages of recruiting specified previously. However, we also believe that artificial intelligence promises to solve specific issues of scale within the hiring process, for example, by rapidly sifting through a bulk of job applications to surface to the recruiter the best-matched applicants. We have already integrated AI improvements into our candidate campaigning and sourcing processes, and we are currently evaluating new businesses, methods, and partnerships to transform further and improve our technology.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Monetize the Businesses and Candidates Seeking to Access the Community and Platform:
 
We intend to not only develop new clients for all of our services, but also expand relationships with our existing clients and increase their spending on our platform by investing in building new products and features.
 

● | Attract New Clients Through Strategic Partnerships with MSP and HR Providers: We intend to expand our marketing efforts with partners to attract new clients by increasing awareness of our platform and the benefits of using flexible and on-demand recruiting.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broaden and Deepen Categories: We intend to focus on customizing experiences for vertical industry groups, such as Information Technology or Accounting and Finance, through tailored features and functionalities, making it easier and more efficient for clients to connect with the right recruiters.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build Effective Candidate Solutions: We plan to continue to expand our candidate offerings from basic resume distribution to video resumes, training programs, career coaching, resume writing, job alerts, and other SaaS services to monetize our traffic and help people effectively connect with opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Build Out Video: We plan to leverage a video offering as a SaaS solution for our enterprise clients, partners, and recruiters, as video interviewing and screening may become a must-have requirement for business recruiting, particularly in the post-COVID-19 environment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Acquire Complementary Assets and Businesses:
 
The Company seeks opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and personnel within the recruitment and staffing sector, primarily to expand the overall number of employers using our Platform to source talented employees and contractors.

● | Increase Employer Demand: The Company plans to approach recruitment companies with firm client control and knowledge, such as recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) companies in major cities within the continental United States and with stable, diversified client revenues. These types of acquisitions may help increase the number and diversity of jobs in the marketplace platform and allow for the upselling of our new and planned products for employers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further Our Technology Offering: The Company plans to evaluate specific valuable online tools for recruiters that would enhance our overall platform, such as candidate sourcing technologies, data appending services, job distribution and marketing software, lead generation tools, and others that would improve our value to our community of recruiters, to improve engagement and daily use metrics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance Strategic Technology: The Company continually monitors and evaluates third-party companies for technology that would be of strategic value. Management is particularly mindful of the emergence of artificial intelligence being applied to hiring and recruitment processes. We are interested in acquiring or licensing such technologies that offer fundamental advancements to our Platform and, therefore, long-term shareholder value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5) Approach the Future with Clarity and Vision:
 

● | Trust Our Vision: Recruiter.com has a big name, but an even bigger purpose: to “recruit” means to inspire someone to join a cause. Our mission at Recruiter.com is more than just primarily connecting job seekers and employers. We also want to inspire people to better themselves, to grab opportunities and to believe in themselves. Simply put, Recruiter.com exists to open doors for people. We are inspired by our mission and purpose, and we trust in our overall vision to continue to inspire the dedication necessary to build a fantastic brand and valuable company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain Our Values: Our staff developed our core values, which we seek to identify in people that we hire and promote and inspire within ourselves. These core values include being passionate, dependable, adaptable, helpful, resilient, and honest and open communicators. As we grow, we will maintain and build on these core values, and we will use them to inform our business decisions and the ways in which we interact with each other and the community.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lead in People-First Technology: We are committed to building continuous innovation in technology and being early builders and adopters of technical improvements, such as the use of AI and machine learning. We will strive to be bold leaders in human-centric technology by always positioning that technology for the benefit and economic empowerment of people. We believe that the future holds great promise for further connectivity, collaboration, and community. We aim to be opportunistic in the development and acquisition of such technologies for our users.

Technical Vision Strategy - Towards Autonomous Recruiting
 
The job market and broader economy itself are evolving to adapt to automation, technology adoption, disruption, and, more recently, machine learning. McKinsey’s Future of Work in America report, states: “What lies ahead is not a sudden robot takeover but a period of ongoing, and perhaps accelerated, change in how work is organized and the mix of jobs in the economy. Even as some jobs decline, the US economy will continue to create others — and technologies themselves will give rise to new occupations. All workers will need to adapt as machines take over routine and some physical tasks and as demand grows for work involving socio-emotional, creative, technological, and higher cognitive skills.”
 
As in many professions, recruiting itself is both threatened and positively enabled by technology. As a platform company, we are optimistic about our positioning and ability to not only adapt to, but to lead some of these transformations. Through our marketplace and network, we are gathering data intelligence while we improve our work processing, enabling a virtuous cycle of systemic and profitable improvements. Specifically, as our artificial intelligence tools get better, our community of recruiters strengthens their ability to deliver talent by leveraging these tools. Additionally, the community’s work output informs our systems, and, over time, this helps tune and develop our approach to further intelligent automation.
 
We are building our overall technology platform toward a vision of efficient, near-autonomous recruiting. That said, recruiting — the process of inspiring others to join a better opportunity and the subsequent judgment of their abilities and fit to do so — is an inherently social practice. We will attempt to lead in the development of technology that remembers and supports this most critical factor, with the overall mission of connecting talent to opportunity in a more fluid, rapid, and seamless manner.
 
Our Clients
 
Recruiter.com’s unique, scalable, AI-powered network allows it to meet the hiring needs of a variety of clients, from Fortune 100 enterprises to high-quality startups. We typically focus on filling highly skilled and senior-level roles in specialized fields, including technology, healthcare, finance, logistics/transportation, communications, engineering, energy, and many others. Our network’s vast reach is also well-suited for high-volume hiring projects requiring large numbers of candidates in a short period.
 
The majority of our revenue (approximately 90%) is generated by providing Recruiting Solutions for employers, consisting of success-based placement fees for fulltime employee referrals and hourly and project-based fees for professional consulting and staffing. Our clients include Schlumberger, Halliburton Co., Ford Motor Co., Coca Cola Co., and Bluebeam, Inc. As of December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance, at 32%, and 19%, for a total of 51%. As of December 31, 2019, three customers accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance, at 19%, 15% and 13%, for a total of 47%.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020 three customers accounted for 10% of more of total revenue, at 30%, 20% and 11%, for a total of 61%. For the year ended December 31, 2019 two customers accounted for 10% or more of total revenue, at 32% and 17%, for a total of 49%.
 
The Company’s focus is to increase and improve its suite of product offerings and solutions to address different needs of potential employers in order to increase its client base and reduce reliance on the three customers accounting for the large percentage of its revenue.
 
Our Platform and Technology
 
Our Platform
 
Our Job Market Platform, augmented with AI-powered candidate-sourcing and matching technology, allows our clients to leverage the scalable sourcing power of an extensive network of independent recruiters, with the account management and personalized talent delivery of a full-service recruitment firm. Our Platform can be used on a stand-alone basis or can be integrated with platforms operated by third parties or managed service providers (MSP) to drive client demand. Our Platform is accessible through our website at www.recruiter.com.

Artificial Intelligence and Video
 
We use AI candidate-sourcing and matching technology to improve the functionality and effectiveness of our solutions. This technology helps match job descriptions to candidate resumes to find the best potential matches, which are then provided to the user. We license candidate-matching software from third parties, including Genesys, which was recently rebranded “Opptly,” and Censia. The initial term of our license agreement with Genesys, which was executed in connection with our asset purchase agreement with Genesys, expires on May 31, 2021, and Genesys or Recruiter.com can choose not to renew the license for successive one-year terms after that. Our license agreement with Censia may be terminated either by Censia or us at any time with a 180-day prior written notice. We contracted MyInterview to build a video hiring platform through a license and services agreement, with support and resourcing for the product for a term of three (3) years from the March 30, 2020.

● | Genesys: Genesys is an AI talent-matching system designed primarily to address more critical higher-volume or recurring demands. Genesys works collaboratively with customers to proactively develop talent clouds to address hiring needs. Rather than relying solely on resumes from job boards or applicant tracking systems, Genesys combines a holistic sourcing strategy with force multipliers such as recruitment marketing and referrals to reach widely dispersed audiences of specific candidates. In the past year, Recruiter.com has developed deep functional integrations with Genesys, including job and candidate transmission, and the development of automated matched lists of candidates that are relayed to our network of independent recruiters.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Censia: Censia’s Talent Intelligence Platform instantly models and delivers the best talent for organizations. The comprehensive platform replaces writing job descriptions, posting positions, passive searching, reviewing resumes and previous applicants, and searching the company for candidates with two clicks and intuitive search filters. The partnership with Censia will allow both our network of independent recruiters and its internal Talent Delivery team access to Censia on a performance basis. Recruiter.com users will source candidates directly from the Recruiter.com platform, powered by a unique application integration. Recruiters will tap into hundreds of millions of professionals, matched and ranked according to Censia’s predictive algorithms and machine learning. The technical integration with Censia was officially launched on September 22, 2020. Video: Recruiter.com Video delivers on-demand video screening services for businesses hiring new employees. The platform serves as a replacement for the traditional process of reviewing paper resumes and digital text-based profiles. The platform was developed by MyInterview, a video interviewing company, in a collaborative partnership subject to the three-year services and license agreement. The Recruiter.com Video platform was officially launched on October 28, 2020. Since then, Recruiter.com launched an affiliate partner program and additionally bolstered its video offerings through the acquisition of video-based candidate sourcing platform, Scouted.

Our Technology Infrastructure
 
Hosting
 
We currently host our platform at data centers owned by Databank in Baltimore, MD, which has systems for automated backup storage and retrieval. Our websites, applications, and infrastructure were designed to support high-volume traffic. Our management has reviewed Databank’s independently audited “SOC 2® Type 2 Report on Controls Relevant to Security and Availability for Data Center Services” and believes Databank’s security protocols to be at or exceeding the level of equivalent technology providers.
Personnel
 
Software development, database management, remote server administration, quality assurance, and administrative systems access is managed overseas by Recruiter Mauritius Ltd. under the direction of our Chief Technology Officer, Ashley Saddul, who works in Mauritius along with other technical personnel. From time to time, the Company also engages technical personnel on an as-needed basis from other locations, including the United States and India, who are also managed by Ashley Saddul.
Product Development
 
We continue to invest in product development, including our SaaS model, which will allow for greater self-service, enhance our platform, improve user experience, develop new products and features, and further build our infrastructure. Our goal is to create the most extensive and on-demand online marketplace of recruiters and recruiting technologies, enabling employers to identify and engage with top talent faster than ever before.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing Strategy
 
Our sales and marketing strategy is centered around driving cost-effective awareness of our brand and the benefits of our platform among recruiters and employers of all sizes, from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies. Most of our new recruiter and employer registrations come from direct navigation to our website through unpaid search engine results listings, social media, and other content-based, no-cost referrals. We draw on our robust recruiting and staffing business foundation to build a sales pipeline and grow account relationships.

Network Effect Strategy
 
The Recruiter.com platform and network is a form of marketplace, governed by supply and demand. In our business, supply is the availability of in-demand candidate talent, which is enabled by the specialization and volume of our recruiter community members. Demand consists of the need for hiring services by employers, which is represented by job postings on our platform.
 
Supply and demand are inextricably linked, and we create virtuous cycles of growth in each by increasing one side or the other. Our strategy is to create the largest network of recruiters in each local market and industry, creating an unprecedented supply of recruiting talent, encompassing every type of industry, skill, and specialization. This broad availability of supply creates a liquidity network effect, where we can offer services anywhere to any employer, thus increasing demand potential.
 
Already, because of our network strategy, we can offer a highly differentiated, technology-focused solutions to employers, as we can provide a multidisciplinary talent supply. As an example of our supply diversity, we provide on-demand recruiters to a growth-stage startup, nursing talent to an employer in California, and call center personnel to an employer in Texas. For other businesses, we offer standalone technology on a subscription basis. Over time, we expect this network effect will lead to a margin advantage as compared to our competitors, which tend to scale supply through physical office footprints and acquisitions alone. 
 
Sales Strategy
 
Most of our sales opportunities are derived from Internet marketing and content strategies, which generate interest and traffic from search engines, such as but not limited to Google, which index our website content. Word of mouth, customer and user referrals, and general brand recall and recognition also generate a significant number of visits to our website. Visitors to our website then express interest and contact the company through standard electronic forms on our website. We employ Account Managers who follow up with these leads and perform inbound or inside sales functions to develop quality relationships with our customers. As much as possible, we rely on automated contract solutions to engage with our clients seamlessly. Our sales strategy includes the hiring of both internal and external sales and sales management personnel to conduct our sales relationships. As we expand our solution offerings, we increasingly cross-sell across our on-demand recruiting technology and solutions.
 
We intend to employ several strategic methods to attract the best sales talent, including by offering attractive commission splits, bonuses, technology capabilities, and lead generation. These factors, in addition to the benefits of our Recruiter.com brand, should facilitate the recruitment of highly qualified talent. Also, we look for ways to partner with leading recruiting firms and successful independent recruiting salespeople, allowing them to sell under the Recruiter.com brand to accelerate our organic growth significantly.
 
Partnerships
 
Recruiter.com has forged relationships with many firms in the recruiting, HR, and payroll space. Partnerships constitute an essential component of our sales and marketing strategy, as these partnerships may stimulate sales demand for our hiring solutions, including success-based recruiting, on-demand offerings, and, in the future, video screening services. We pursue strategic alliances with employer service providers for joint marketing and cross-selling activities, and we seek platform integrations with strategic partners to generate client demand.

No one understands the talent market like the recruiters, HR professionals, and talent acquisition experts working on the front lines. At Recruiter.com, we have the unique ability to survey our vast network of independent recruiting and talent acquisition specialists to uncover job market trends.

Competition
 
The market for online staffing and recruitment services is highly competitive, fragmented, and undergoing rapid changes following increasing demand, technological advancements, and shifting needs. We compete with several online and offline platforms and services, including but not limited to, the following:

● | Traditional talent acquisition and staffing service providers and other outsourcing providers, such as the Adecco Group; Korn Ferry; Russell Reynolds Associates, Inc.; and Robert Half International, Inc.;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Online and offline job boards, classified ads, and other traditional means of finding work and service providers, such as Craigslist, CareerBuilder, Indeed, Monster, and ZipRecruiter.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additionally, well-established internet companies, such as Google and Amazon, have entered or may decide to join our market and compete with our platform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We compete based on several factors, including, among other things: size and engagement of user base, brand awareness and reputation, relationships with third-party partners, and pricing. We differentiate ourselves through what we call our “three uniques:” people, power, and platform. We pride ourselves on:
 

● | Our people, who are experts in the recruiting industry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | The power of our robust network of recruiters, top internet brand, distribution channels, and content and social media followings; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The platform, which is a complete and custom-built marketplace software platform, with many integrations and partnerships, which has developed over several years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These “three uniques” form our competitive “moat,” which management believes would be highly challenging for any competitor to replicate.

Ct. 2298 (2020), the Court affirmed registration of a trademark that used a generic term followed by the addition of the top-level domain moniker ‘.com’ to the end of the mark.” Based on this action, Recruiter.com has filed an intent-to-use application and application for inclusion in the Supplemental Registry for the generic domain and brand of “Recruiter.com.” The Company cannot be assured of being granted this trademark.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of US federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that apply to internet companies and businesses that operate online marketplaces connecting businesses with recruiters. These laws and regulations may involve worker classification, employment, data protection, privacy, online payment services, content regulation, intellectual property, taxation, consumer protection, background checks, payment services, money transmitter regulations, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and sanctions laws, or other matters. Many of the rules and regulations that are or may apply to our business are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could adversely impact our business. Also, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the industry in which we operate.
 
Additionally, our technology platform and the platform user data it uses, collects, or processes to run our business is an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the use, collection, and processing of personal data is part of our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.
 
Regulators around the world have adopted, or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two such governmental regulations that carry implications for our platform are the GDPR and the CCPA.
 
The GDPR went into effect in May 2018, implementing more stringent requirements in relation to companies’ use of personal data relating to all EU individuals (“data subjects”). Under the GDPR, the expanded definition of personal data includes information such as name, identification number, email address, location data, online identifiers such as internet protocol addresses and cookie identifiers, or any other type of information that can identify a living individual. The GDPR imposes a number of new requirements, which include: a valid ground for processing each instance of personal data; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; providing expanded information about how data subjects’ personal data is or will be used; carrying out data protection impact assessments for operations which present specific risks to individuals due to the nature or scope of the processing operation; an obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights; the principle of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training, and audit; profiling restrictions; and a new mandatory data breach reporting regime.
 
In the United States, California recently adopted the CCPA, which came into effect in January 2020. Similar in certain respects to the GDPR, the CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expanded definition of “personal information”; new data privacy rights for California residents, requiring covered businesses to provide further disclosure to consumers and affording consumers the right to opt-out of individual sales of personal information; special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors; and a potentially severe statutory damages framework and private rights of action for CCPA violations and failure to implement reasonable security procedures and practices.

Culture and Team 
 
Most of our staff members have many years of experience in online recruiting and technology. We’re inspired every day by our mission to connect people better to create terrific job matches. Our people are musicians, programmers, writers, speakers, mathematicians, gardeners, parachuters, runners, hikers, sports fanatics, backyard chicken farmers, and photographers. We are a family-first company, with many hard-working parents raising the next generation of Recruiter.com interns.
 
As we build the next generation of recruiting technology, we look for people who are passionate about connecting people and helping to develop better work experiences and career opportunities for others. We pride ourselves on being a team on a mission, with big goals and even bigger dreams for the company. We work virtually, with lean operations and an efficient cost model, while staying firmly connected through chat and video.
 
We are a place to make an impact. We pay little attention to job titles and much more attention to results - who’s thinking creatively and making positive contributions daily. At all times, we try to effectively tie things like compensation to direct contribution and foster an environment of inclusion and fair equity. To summarize, we’re specialists in recruiting and know what it takes to be an employer of choice and a great place to work. We strive to make our work enjoyable, rewarding, and full of growth opportunities for our staff. 
 
Diversity 
 
We connect people from an extraordinarily diverse range of backgrounds and locations. We strive to make a product that makes a difference, and one that helps build a just, equitable future for us all. We are committed to being an equal opportunity employer ourselves, and we only work with clients who respect both the law and spirit of equal opportunity employment. Further, we believe that, as we grow as a company, our success will be predicated on drawing from and amplifying a diverse range of voices, both internally and externally.
 
We are fortunate to have a vibrant and innovative staff from diverse backgrounds. We hold ourselves to a high standard of equity and inclusion. Currently, we have people of color, women, and members of the LGBTQ+ community in senior roles at the company, including executive leadership and on our Board of Directors (the “Board”).
 
We welcome people from all backgrounds to apply to our internal careers and our client roles. We are also very interested in developing new practices to increase fairness in our hiring processes, including quantitative assessments, bias training, and reducing bias from new virtual tools that we introduce, such as video screening. We regularly and routinely seek out ways to improve our recruiting practices and expand the breadth and depth of our network of recruiters.
