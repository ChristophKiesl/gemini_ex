Equities
Equities Research, Capital Markets
We provide our clients full-service equities research, sales and trading capabilities across global equities markets. We earn commissions or spread revenue by executing, settling and clearing transactions for clients across these markets in equity and equity-related products, including common stock, American depository receipts, global depository receipts, exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded and over-the-counter (“OTC”) equity derivatives, convertible and other equity-linked products and closed-end funds. Our equity research, sales and trading efforts are organized across three geographical regions: the Americas; Europe and the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. Our clients are primarily institutional market participants such as mutual funds, hedge funds, investment advisors, pension and profit sharing plans, and insurance companies. Through our global research team and sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, distribute investment research and insights, trading ideas, market information and analyses across a range of industries and receive and execute client orders. Our equity research covers 2,800 companies around the world and a further more than 600 international companies are covered by our leading co-branded partner firms in local regions.
Equity Finance
Our Equity Finance business provides financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services. We offer prime brokerage services in the U.S. that provide hedge funds, money managers and registered investment advisors with execution, financing, clearing, outsourced trading, reporting and administrative services. We finance our clients’ securities positions through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable liquid collateral. We earn an interest spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we receive from our clients. We also operate a matched book in equity and corporate bond securities, whereby we borrow and lend securities versus cash or liquid collateral and earn a net interest spread. We offer selected prime brokerage clients the option of custodying their assets at an unaffiliated U.S. broker-dealer that is a subsidiary of a bank holding company. Under this arrangement, we directly provide our clients with all customary prime brokerage services.
Wealth Management
We provide tailored wealth management services designed to meet the needs of high net worth individuals, their families and their businesses, private equity and venture funds and small institutions.

JEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

Real Estate 
Berkadia Commercial Mortgage Holding LLC (“Berkadia”) is our 50/50 joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. that provides capital solutions, investment sales advisory and mortgage servicing for multifamily and commercial real estate. Berkadia originates commercial real estate loans, primarily in respect of multifamily housing units, for the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Federal Housing Authority using their underwriting guidelines and will typically sell the loans to such entities shortly after the loans are funded with Berkadia retaining the mortgage servicing rights. For loans sold to Fannie Mae, Berkadia assumes a shared loss position throughout the term of each loan, with a maximum loss percentage of approximately one-third of the original principal balance. Berkadia also originates and brokers commercial/multifamily mortgage loans, which are not part of the government agency programs. 
In addition, Berkadia originates loans for its own balance sheet. These loans provide interim financing to borrowers who intend to refinance the loan with longer-term loans from an eligible government agency or other third-party. Berkadia also provides services related to the acquisition and disposition of multifamily real estate projects, including brokerage services, asset review, market research, financial analysis and due diligence support and is a servicer of U.S. commercial real estate loans, performing primary, master and special servicing functions for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. 
Asset Management
Under the Leucadia Asset Management (“LAM”) umbrella, we manage and provide services to a diverse group of alternative asset management platforms across a spectrum of investment strategies and asset classes. LAM offers institutional clients an innovative range of investment strategies through its affiliated managers. Our products are currently offered to pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors globally. The investment products under LAM range from multi-manager products to niche equity long/short strategies to credit strategies. We offer our affiliated asset managers access to capital, operational infrastructure and global marketing and distribution. We often invest seed or additional strategic capital for our own account in the strategies offered by us and associated third-party asset managers in which we have an interest.
We continue to expand our asset management efforts and establish further strategic relationships to expand our offerings including sector and region specific long/short equity and quantitative strategies.
Human Capital
Our people make up the fabric of our firm, which is comprised of diverse and innovative teams. We are focused on the durability, health and long-term growth and development of our business, as well as our long-term contribution to our shareholders, our clients, our employees, the communities in which we live and work, and society in general. Instrumental to all of this is our culture, which derives from our employees.
We have employees located throughout the world. At November 30, 2021, we had 4,508 employees globally with approximately 64.1%, 24.2% and 11.7% of our workforce distributed across the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, respectively. 
Our employees are predominantly in our Investment Banking and Capital Markets segment or the support thereof. During fiscal 2021, our overall employee count increased by 14.9%, primarily as a result the growth of our investment banking business, as well as due to additions in technology and other corporate services staff to support our increased regulatory requirements and overall growth.
Talent Acquisition and Development
In order to compete effectively and continue to provide best in class service to our clients, we must attract, retain, and motivate qualified professionals. Our workforce is predominately composed of employees in roles such as investment bankers, salespeople, trading professionals, research professionals and other revenue producing or specialized personnel. During 2021, we hired over 1,200 professionals globally. Our voluntary turnover rate was approximately 12.2%, which makes our overall retention rate very high in our view. We believe our culture, our effort to maintain a meritocracy in terms of opportunity and our continued evolution and growth contribute to our success in attracting and retaining strong talent.
We also value continued training and development for all employees at the firm. We seek to equip our people at all stages in their careers with the tools necessary to become thoughtful and effective leaders. In 2021, we introduced a number of additional development programs, including our inaugural Women in Leadership Series, a program focused on providing learning and development opportunities to position our female leaders for success. We also launched a leadership development program sponsored by our Jefferies Black & Latino Network (J-NOBLE) and Jefferies Ethnic Minority Society (JEMS) that is aimed at providing professional development and career advancement training to participants. Additionally, we offered customized 
JEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

training courses centered around Project Management, Communicating with Clarity and Impact, Managing in the New Normal, Finding and Using Your Strengths and Effective Sales Training for our employees. 
Wellness 
In addition to training and development programs, we’ve been incredibly focused on the well-being of our employees. We host frequent wellness webinars and offer confidential, 1:1 wellness counseling. To support our employee’s physical well-being, we host virtual fitness classes and have partnered with a fitness app our employees can utilize.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
The foundation of our culture is our approach to employee engagement, diversity, equity and inclusion, which is summed up in our Corporate Social Responsibility Principle: Respect People. We embrace diversity and inclusion, which we believe fosters creativity, innovation and thought leadership through the infusion of new ideas and perspectives. We have implemented a number of policies and measures focused on non-discrimination, sexual harassment prevention, health and safety, and training and education. We have strong internal partnerships with eight Employee Resource Groups that are fostering a diverse, inclusive workplace. Our Diversity Council, chaired by Rich Handler, gives our Employee Resource Groups a platform to come together and discuss best practices, as well as collaborate on firmwide diversity initiatives. 
In conjunction with the Employee Resource Groups, firmwide Diversity and Inclusion initiatives are focused on open firm-wide dialogues, promotion of allyship and bias mitigation, and providing resources for development and recruiting the best talent from a diverse pool. In 2021, 100% of our employees participated in Unconscious Bias Training. We have focused on improving the collection and transparency of diversity metrics and the information flow to senior leadership. An inaugural firmwide inclusion-focused employee engagement survey was launched in January 2021 enabling staff to provide feedback on an anonymous basis.
We are focused on broadening the pipeline from which we recruit and hiring diverse talent through both campus and lateral hiring initiatives. For campus recruiting, we have partnered with several organizations globally to broaden our pipeline of candidates. We host insight days and symposiums that describe Jefferies and Investment Banking to candidates that come from a diverse range of backgrounds. In 2021, we hired interns from over 100 colleges, universities, and business schools across the globe. For all roles, we recommend both a diverse slate of candidates to be considered for roles and a diverse panel of interviewers. Interviewing guides and resources are provided to hiring managers in an effort to support inclusive hiring. In 2021, we launched two targeted recruiting programs aimed at diversifying the pipeline of our lateral hires, including a career relaunch program, aimed at those who have taken a break from the workforce, and a job switch program aimed at recruiting individuals who are interested in changing careers into Equity Research.
Our Board has underscored our commitment to diversity by committing to appoint diverse candidates to fill the seats of at least one-third of our independent directors. In July 2021, we appointed two new female directors to our Board, which resulted in 55.6% of our independent directors being diverse. 
Our Board has established an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Oversight Committee, which, among other things, oversees the sustainability matters arising from our business. In the beginning of 2021, the Board expanded the responsibilities of the ESG Committee to also include oversight over diversity and inclusion, and rebranded the Committee as the ESG, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“ESG/DEI”) Committee. Establishing the ESG/DEI Committee demonstrates our and the Board’s ongoing commitment of driving and fostering diversity in the workforce and in the communities in which we operate.
We have also made a commitment to building a culture that provides opportunities for all employees regardless of our differences. As a result, we are able to pool our collective insights and intelligence to provide fresh and innovative thinking for our clients. 
We encourage you to review the ESG Report of our ultimate parent company, Jefferies Financial Group, Inc. (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website, including the ESG Report or sections thereof is deemed incorporated by reference into this Report. In addition, for discussion of the risks relating our ability to attract, develop and retain highly skilled and productive employees, see “Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Employee Benefits
Our benefits are designed to attract and retain employees by providing employees and their spouses, partners and families with health and wellness programs (medical, dental, vision and behavioral), retirement wealth accumulation, paid time off, income replacement (paid sick and disability leaves and life insurance) and family oriented benefits (parental leaves and child care assistance). We also endeavor to provide location specific health club, transportation and employee discounts.
Giving Back to Community
JEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

The firm is committed to giving back to our communities. In 2021, we donated $13.2 million to approximately 175 organizations across two “Doing Good” trading days. Additionally, through our Employee Resource Groups, employees have created lasting partnerships by volunteering time to support several of these charitable partners. 
Competition
All aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We compete primarily with large global bank holding companies that engage in capital markets activities, but also with other broker-dealers, asset managers and boutique investment banking firms. The large global bank holding companies have substantially greater capital and resources than we do. We believe that the principal factors affecting our competitive standing include the quality, experience and skills of our professionals, the depth of our relationships, the breadth of our service offerings, our ability to deliver consistently our integrated capabilities, and our culture, tenacity and commitment to serve our clients.
Regulation
Regulation in the United States. The financial services industry in which we operate is subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) is the federal agency responsible for the administration of laws relating to commodity interests (including futures, commodity options and swaps). In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”) are self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) that are actively involved in the regulation of financial services businesses (securities businesses in the case of FINRA and commodities/futures businesses in the case of the NFA). In addition, broker-dealers that conduct securities activities involving municipal securities are subject to regulation by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). In addition to federal regulation, we are subject to state securities regulations in each state and U.S. territory in which we conduct securities or investment advisory activities. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA and state securities regulators conduct periodic examinations of broker-dealers, investment advisors, futures commission merchants (“FCMs”), swap dealers and security-based swap dealers (“SBS dealers”). The designated examining authority under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) for Jefferies LLC’s activities as a broker-dealer is FINRA, and the designated self-regulatory organization under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act for Jefferies LLC’s non-clearing FCM activities is the NFA. Financial services businesses are also subject to regulation and examination by state securities regulators and attorneys general in those states in which they do business. In addition, broker-dealers, investment advisors, FCMs, swap dealers and SBS dealers must also comply with the rules and regulation of clearing houses, exchanges, swap execution facilities and trading platforms of which they are a member.
Broker-dealers are subject to SEC, FINRA, MSRB and, state securities regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading methods, trade practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital structure and requirements, anti-money laundering efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct of broker-dealer personnel including officers and employees (although state securities regulations are, in a number of cases, more limited). Registered investment advisors are subject to, among other requirements, SEC regulations concerning marketing, transactions with affiliates, custody of client assets, disclosures to clients, conflict of interest, insider trading and recordkeeping; and investment advisors that are also registered as commodity trading advisors or commodity pool operators are also subject to regulation by the CFTC and the NFA. FCMs, introducing brokers and swap dealers that engage in commodity options, futures or swap transactions are subject to regulation by the CFTC and the NFA, and SBS dealers are subject to regulation by the SEC. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NFA, other SROs of which the broker-dealer is a member, and state securities regulators, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or rules may directly affect the operations and profitability of broker-dealers, investment advisors, FCMs, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, swap dealers and SBS dealers. The SEC, CFTC, FINRA, NFA, state securities regulators and state attorneys general may conduct administrative proceedings or initiate civil litigation that can result in adverse consequences for Jefferies LLC, its affiliates, including affiliated investment advisors, as well as its and their officers and employees (including, without limitation, injunctions, censures, fines, suspensions, directives that impact business operations (including proposed expansions), membership expulsions, or revocations of licenses and registrations). 
SEC Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”) requires that a broker-dealer and its associated persons act in a retail customer’s best interest and not place their own financial or other interests ahead of a retail customer’s interests when recommending securities transactions or investment strategies, including recommendations of types of accounts. To meet this best interest standard, a broker-dealer must satisfy four component obligations including a disclosure obligation, a care obligation, a conflict of interest obligation, and a compliance obligation and both broker-dealers and investment advisors are required to provide disclosures about their standard of conduct and conflicts of interest.
In addition, certain states, have proposed or adopted measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents and investment advisors and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers. The SEC did 
JEFFERIES GROUP LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

not indicate an intent to pre-empt state regulation in this area, and some of the state proposals would allow for a private right of action. Since our Wealth Management division makes recommendations to retail customers, it is required to comply with the obligations imposed under Reg BI and applicable state laws.
Regulatory Capital Requirements. Several of our entities are subject to financial capital requirements that are set by regulation. Jefferies LLC is a dually registered broker-dealer and FCM and is required to maintain net capital in excess of the greater of the SEC or CFTC minimum financial requirements. As a broker-dealer, Jefferies LLC is subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule (the “Net Capital Rule”). Jefferies LLC has elected to compute its minimum net capital requirement in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted by the Net Capital Rule, which provides that a broker-dealer shall not permit its net capital, as defined, to be less than the greater of 2% of its aggregate debit balances (primarily customer-related receivables) or $250,000 ($1.5 million for prime brokers). Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit Jefferies LLC’s operations, such as underwriting and trading activities, and financing customers’ prime brokerage or other margin activities, in each case, that could require the use of significant amounts of capital, limit its ability to engage in certain financing transactions, such as repurchase agreements, and may also restrict its ability (i) to make payments of dividends, withdrawals or similar distributions or payments to a stockholder/parent or other affiliate, (ii) to make a redemption or repurchase of shares of stock, or (iii) to make an unsecured loan or advance to such shareholders or affiliates. As a carrying/clearing broker-dealer, under FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA could impose higher minimum net capital requirements than required by the SEC, and could restrict a broker-dealer from expanding business or require the broker-dealer to reduce its business activities. If the broker dealer also carries accounts for other broker dealers which are engaged in proprietary trading, it may need net capital of $7 million or tentative net capital of $25 million, depending on circumstances. As a non-clearing FCM, Jefferies LLC is also required to maintain minimum adjusted net capital of $1.0 million.
SEC registered broker-dealers that also register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers engaging in principal transactions of security-based swaps (“SBS”) are subject to rules regarding capital, segregation and margin requirements. The SEC rules establish similar standards for an entity registering as a standalone SBS dealer. The CFTC and NFA have also adopted swap dealer capital rules. Under the rules there is a minimum net capital requirement for, among others, an entity that acts as a dealer in SBS or swaps, which is the greater of $20 million or 2% (that the SEC could, in the future, increase up to 4% or 8%) of a risk margin amount. The risk margin amount for the SEC means the sum of (i) the total initial margin required to be maintained by the SEC-registered SBS dealer at each clearinghouse with respect to SBS or swap transactions cleared for SBS or swap customers and (ii) the total initial margin amount calculated by the SEC-registered SBS dealer with respect to non-cleared SBS and swaps under the SEC rules. The risk margin amount for the CFTC means the total initial margin amount calculated by the CFTC-registered swap dealer with respect to non-cleared SBS and swaps under the CFTC rules. 
Jefferies Financial Services, Inc. (“JFSI”), one of our subsidiaries, is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and registered with the SEC as an SBS. As of late 2021, JFSI is now required to comply with the SEC and CFTC capital rules for SBS dealers and swap dealers, respectively. Further, subsequent to year-end, on December 16, 2021, JFSI was approved by the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer, and is subject to compliance with the SEC’s net capital requirements. 
Under the Exchange Act, state securities regulators are not permitted to impose capital, margin, custody, financial responsibility, making and keeping records, bonding, or financial or operational reporting requirements on registered broker-dealers that differ from, or are in addition to, the requirements in those areas established under the Exchange Act, including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors - “New legislation and regulation may significantly affect our business.”
Jefferies Group LLC is not subject to any regulatory capital rules.
See Net Capital within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Note 19, Net Capital Requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of net capital calculations.
Regulation outside the United States. We are an active participant in the international capital markets and provide investment banking services internationally, primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific. As in the U.S., our international subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulations proposed, promulgated and enforced by, among other regulatory bodies, the European Commission and European Supervisory Authorities (including the European Banking Authority and European Securities and Market Authority), U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (“BaFin”), Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada, Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Japan Financial Services Agency, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Every country in which we do business imposes upon us laws, rules and regulations similar to those in the U.S., including with respect to some form of capital adequacy rules, customer protection rules, data protection regulations, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery rules, compliance with other applicable trading and investment banking regulations and similar regulatory reform.
