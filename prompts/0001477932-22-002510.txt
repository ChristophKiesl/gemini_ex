Item 1. Business

Viking Energy Group, Inc. (“Viking”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a growth-oriented diversified energy company. Through various majority-owned subsidiaries, Viking provides custom energy and power solutions to commercial and industrial clients in North America and owns interests in oil and natural gas assets in the United States. The company also holds an exclusive license in Canada to a patented carbon-capture system, and owns a majority interest in entities with intellectual property rights to a fully developed, patent pending, proprietary medical and biohazard waste treatment system using ozone technology; and electric transmission and open conductor detection systems. The Company is also exploring other renewable energy-related opportunities and/or technologies, which are currently generating revenue, or have a reasonable prospect of generating revenue within a reasonable period of time.

Custom Energy & Power Solutions:

The Company’s 60.5% majority-owned subsidiary, Simson-Maxwell Ltd. (“Simson-Maxwell”), is a manufacturer and supplier of power generation products, services and custom energy solutions. Simson-Maxwell provides commercial and industrial clients with efficient, flexible, environmentally responsible and clean-tech energy systems involving a wide variety of products, including: CHP (combined heat and power), tier 4 final diesel and natural gas industrial engines, solar, wind and storage. Simson-Maxwell also designs and assembles a complete line of electrical control equipment including switch gear, synchronization and paralleling gear, distribution, Bi-Fuel and complete power generation production controls. Operating for over 80 years, Simson-Maxwell’s seven branches assist with servicing a large number of existing maintenance arrangements and meeting the energy and power-solution demands of the company’s other customers.

Clean Energy and Carbon-Capture System:

In August 2021, the Company entered into a license agreement with ESG Clean Energy, LLC (“ESG”), to utilize ESG’s patent rights and know-how related to stationary electric power generation and heat and carbon dioxide capture (the “ESG Clean Energy System”). The intellectual property licensed by Viking includes certain patents and/or patent applications, including: (i) U.S. Patent No.: 10,774,733, File date: October 24, 2018, Issue date: September 15, 2020, Titled: “Bottoming Cycle Power System”; (ii) European Patent Application No.: EP18870699.8, International File date: October 24, 2018, Titled: “Bottoming Cycle Power System”; (iii) U.S. Patent Application No.: 17/224,200, File date: April 7, 2021, Titled: “Bottoming Cycle Power System” (which was subsequently approved by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office in March, 2022 (No. 11,286,832); (iv) U.S. Patent Application No.: 17/358,197, File date: June 25, 2021, Titled: “Bottoming Cycle Power System”; (v) U.S. Patent Application No.: 17/448,943, File date: September 27, 2021, Titled: “Systems and Methods Associated With Bottoming Cycle Power Systems for Generating Power and Capturing Carbon Dioxide”; and (vi) U.S. Patent Application No.: 17/448,938, File date: September 27, 2021, Titled: “Systems and Methods Associated With Bottoming Cycle Power Systems for Generating Power, Capturing Carbon Dioxide and Producing Products.

The ESG Clean Energy System is designed to, among other things, generate clean electricity from internal combustion engines and utilize waste heat to capture approximately 100% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from the engine without loss of efficiency, and in a manner to facilitate the production of certain commodities. Patent No. 11,286,832, for example, covers the invention of an “exhaust-gas-to-exhaust-gas heat exchanger” that efficiently cools and then reheats exhaust from a primary power generator so greater energy output can be achieved by a secondary power source with safe ventilation. Another key aspect of this patent is the development of a carbon dioxide capture system that utilizes the waste heat of the carbon dioxide pump to heat and regenerate the adsorber that enables carbon dioxide to be safely contained and packaged.

The Company intends to sell, lease and/or sub-license the ESG Clean Energy System to third parties using, among other things, Simson-Maxwell’s existing distribution channels. The Company may also utilize the ESG Clean Energy System for its own account, whether in connection with its petroleum operations, Simson-Maxwell’s power generation operations, or otherwise.

Medical Waste Disposal System Using Ozone Technology

In January 2022, the Company acquired a 51% interest in Viking Ozone Technology, LLC, which owns the intellectual property rights to a fully developed, patent pending, medical and biohazard waste treatment system using Ozone Technology. Simson-Maxwell, another majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been designated the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and vendor of this system. The technology is designed to be a sustainable alternative to incineration, chemical, autoclave and heat treatment of bio-hazardous waste, and for the treated waste to be classified as renewable fuel for waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities in many locations around the world. 
Open Conductor Detection Technologies

In February 2022, the Company acquired a 51% interest in two entities that own the intellectual property rights to fully developed, patent pending, electric transmission and distribution open conductor detection systems. The systems are designed to detect a break in a transmission line, distribution line, or coupling failure, and to immediately terminate the power to the line before it reaches the ground. The technology is intended to increase public safety and reduce the risk of causing an incendiary event, and to be an integral component within grid hardening and stability initiatives by electric utilities to improve the resiliency and reliability of existing infrastructure.

Holders of Viking Common Stock and Viking Preferred Stock will have any fractional shares of Camber common stock or preferred stock after the Merger rounded up to the nearest whole share.

At the Effective Time, each outstanding Viking equity award, will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration in respect of each share of Viking Common Stock underlying such equity award and, in the case of Viking stock options, be converted into vested Camber stock options based on the merger exchange ratio calculated as provided above (the “Exchange Ratio”).

The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that effective as of the Effective Time, James A. Doris, the current Chief Executive Officer of both Viking and Camber, shall serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company following the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement provides that, as of the Effective Time, the combined company will have its headquarters in Houston, Texas.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Camber and Viking will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, to provide non-public information to third parties and to engage in discussions with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to customary exceptions. Viking is required to hold a meeting of its stockholders to vote upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement and, subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that its stockholders vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Camber is required to hold a meeting of its stockholders to approve the issuance of Viking Common Stock and Viking Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger (the “Share Issuance”).
