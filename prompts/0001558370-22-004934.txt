Item 1. Business
Overview 
Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation (the "Company", “we”, “us” and “our”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on November 6, 2020. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar initial business combination with one or more businesses. The Company is an emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.
Our sponsor, Liberty Media Acquisition Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LMC. The Company shares a management team with LMC. LMC owns interests in subsidiaries and other companies, which are engaged in the global media and entertainment industries. LMC’s principal businesses and assets include its consolidated subsidiaries Sirius XM Holdings Inc., Delta Topco Limited (the parent company of Formula 1), Braves Holdings LLC and equity affiliate Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. 
LMC (including its predecessors) has generated significant returns for investors principally through the acquisition and operational improvement of high quality business across the media, digital media, music, entertainment, communications, telecommunications and technology industries and tax efficiently rearranging, optimizing and monetizing the LMC portfolio to maximize value creation.
On November 6, 2020, the Sponsor purchased 17,250,000 shares of the Company’s Series F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”), for an aggregate price of $25,000. On November 18, 2020, the Sponsor contributed an aggregate of 2,875,000 Founder Shares to the Company’s capital for no consideration resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 14,375,000 Founder Shares. 

The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on January 21, 2021 (the "Effective Date"). On January 26, 2021, the Company consummated the IPO of 57,500,000 units, each consisting of one share of Series A common stock of the Company and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant of the Company (the “Units,” with respect to the shares of Series A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”, and with respect to the warrants, the “Public Warrants”), at $10.00 per Unit, including the underwriters exercising their full over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $575,000,000 which were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Series A Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Substantially concurrent with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 10,000,000 warrants (the "Private Placement Warrants") to its Sponsor, at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, which is discussed in note 3 to the accompanying financial statements. Additionally, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”) under which the Sponsor obtained the right to acquire 25,000,000 forward purchase units (each, a “Forward Purchase Unit” and consisting of one share of Series B common stock, the “Forward Purchase Shares,” and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock, the “Forward Purchase Warrants”) for $250,000,000, in the aggregate, in connection with the Company's initial business combination, which is discussed in note 3 to the accompanying financial statements. 
Our Business Strategy
While our efforts to identify a prospective target business have not been, and will not be, limited to a particular industry, sector or region, we intend to capitalize on our expertise in the media, digital media, music, entertainment, communications, telecommunications and technology industries. 

I-5



Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, fundamentally enhance a company in the public markets. We intend to seek a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and is a business to which we believe we can add value. 
We are committed to delivering attractive returns to all stakeholders. Our Sponsor is foregoing anti-dilution adjustments on the Founder Shares in connection with an initial business combination thereby effectively reducing the cost of capital for any third-party investors at such time. We believe this, together with our committed capital through the Forward Purchase Agreement, will enhance our access to additional third-party capital in connection with our initial business combination and create a competitive advantage in consummating an initial business combination.
Our management team is deeply familiar with the trends of our target industries and brings an investing approach that offers multiple competitive advantages in sourcing, evaluating and executing on opportunities, including: 

● | Stockholder Centric: We think like owners and are focused on long-term gains rather than short-term results. At LMC, the compensation structure of the management team is closely tied to the long-term performance of the stock. In fact, the LMC executive leadership team has a significant portion of its respective net worth tied to LMC. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Forward Looking: We are deeply familiar with the trends of the industries in which we plan to invest and can evaluate the opportunities and risks presented by ongoing secular changes and temporary market disruptions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nimble: Our team is structured to allow it to move quickly when opportunities arise, and we can be creative in our deal structures. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Financially Sophisticated: Our management team has extensive experience in mergers, capital restructuring, divestitures, investing, capital deployment, credit analysis and setting capital structures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-Term Focused: We take a long-term, strategic view in our various operating businesses and are less concerned with short-term bouts of volatility. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary Sourcing Channels and Leading Industry Relationships: We believe the capabilities and connections associated with our management team, in combination with those of LMC, will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of acquisition opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. We expect these sourcing capabilities will be further bolstered by our management team and LMC’s reputation and deep industry relationships.

Effecting a Business Combination 
The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward consummating an initial business combination.
The Company’s initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable) at the time of signing an agreement to enter into an initial business combination. However, the Company will only complete an initial business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect an initial business combination.
The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. Except as required by Delaware law or stock 

I-6



exchange rule, the decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (initially $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations).
The shares of common stock subject to redemption have been recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with an initial business combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination.
The Company will have until January 26, 2023 to consummate an initial business combination (the "Combination Period"). However, if the Company is unable to complete an initial business combination within the Combination Period or 27 months from the IPO if the Company has executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination by January 26, 2023 (an “agreement in principle event”), the Company will redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to applicable law and as further described in the prospectus filed on January 25, 2021 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate.
The Company’s Sponsor and the Company’s officers and directors have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and Public Shares in connection with the completion of the initial business combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares and private placement shares if the Company fails to complete the initial business combination within the Combination Period.
The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether its Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and the Company believes that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.
Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us. 
Certain members of our management team directly or indirectly own our securities following the IPO, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may 

I-7



have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
Each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Also, none of LMC, our Sponsor or any of our directors and officers is prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their initial business combinations. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company; such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue; and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity. Additionally, none of LMC, our Sponsor or any other entity currently has any obligation or duty to provide us with any potential business combination opportunity. 
In addition, LMC has adopted a policy pursuant to which any business combination opportunity that is a corporate opportunity of LMC that may also be a business combination opportunity for our Company will first be presented to a standing committee of the board of directors of LMC for consideration as to whether LMC desires to pursue such business combination opportunity as a direct investment or to present such opportunity to our Company for consideration. John C. Malone, Chairman of the Board of LMC, is the sole member of that committee and does not serve in any fiduciary capacity at our Company. 
We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors or the LMC policy described above materially affects our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is owned by our Sponsor or any of the related companies (as defined below), or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with any of them. 
You should not rely on the historical record or performance of LMC, Mr. Gregory B. Maffei, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, or other members of our management team as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward. 
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete 

I-8



such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-business combination company, depending on, among other things, valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, or issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock or other changes to our capital structure, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction (including our Sponsor) could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction and therefore a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-transaction company. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test. 
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the Securities and Exchange Commission to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Human Capital
In connection with our services agreement with LMC, we currently have four executive officers: Gregory B. Maffei (Chief Executive Officer and President), Albert E. Rosenthaler (Chief Corporate Development Officer), Brian J. Wendling (Chief Accounting Officer and Principal Financial Officer), and Renee L. Wilm (Chief Legal Officer and Chief Administrative Officer). These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Pursuant to a services agreement and facilities sharing agreement, we pay LMC and certain of its subsidiaries a total of $91,666 per month for office space, administrative and support services.
Competition
We have encountered and expect to continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Furthermore, our high vote capital structure differs from the typical capital structure of many other special purpose acquisition company competitors and may make us less attractive to an acquisition target or make an acquisition more costly to complete. Additionally, the number of blank check companies looking for 

I-9



business combination targets has increased compared to recent years and many of these blank check companies are sponsored by entities or persons that have significant expertise with completing business combinations. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. See “- If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein.
Available Information
All of our filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Ks, Form 10-Qs and Form 8-Ks, as well as amendments to such filings are available on our Internet website free of charge generally within 24 hours after we file such material with the SEC. Our website address is www.lmacthespac.com.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
​
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Our corporate governance guidelines, code of business conduct and ethics, compensation committee charter, nominating and corporate governance committee charter, and audit committee charter are available on our website.
