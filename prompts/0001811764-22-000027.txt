Overview
POINT has built a platform for the clinical development and commercialization of next generation radiopharmaceuticals that fight cancer. We have a pipeline of product candidates and early-stage development programs, in-house manufacturing capabilities, and a secured supply for rare medical isotopes like actinium-225 ("225Ac") and lutetium-177 ("177Lu"). 
Our management team brings decades of combined experience in radiopharmaceutical clinical development and manufacturing. In an industry where supply chain is often overlooked, POINT has created a unique advantage: a 100% company-owned facility, located in Indianapolis, Indiana, which includes an office space occupying 10,500 square feet and a manufacturing facility occupying 70,200 square feet, and which we believe has the capacity for expansion to commercially supply both North America and Europe with large volumes. We have also assembled one of the radiopharmaceuticals industry’s most resilient isotope supply chains, with the intent to manufacture isotopes such as no-carrier-added ("n.c.a.") 177Lu in-house.
Our product pipeline consists of two late-stage assets in prostate and neuroendocrine cancers as well as an early-stage portfolio of next-generation product candidates. Our late-stage programs are 177Lu-based radiopharmaceuticals. For our early-stage development programs, we plan to evaluate the utility of both 177Lu and 225Ac, as well as other isotopes that may be considered for use in radiopharmaceuticals. With recent innovations in the production and purification of medical isotopes, radiopharmaceuticals are progressing faster than ever before, and we believe POINT is well-positioned to be a leader in this rapidly advancing field.
Our product candidates include:
PNT2002
PNT2002 is a late stage prostate-specific membrane antigen, ("PSMA"), targeted radioligand currently in a Phase 3 trial sponsored by POINT for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, ("mCRPC"), in patients who have progressed following treatment with androgen receptor-axis-targeted, ("ARAT"), therapy. PNT2002 combines a PSMA-specific ligand, PSMA-I&T, with the beta-emitting radioisotope 177Lu, ("177Lu-PSMA-I&T"). 
We initiated a multi-center, randomized, open label Phase 3 Study Evaluating mCRPC Treatment Using PSMA 177Lu-PSMA-I&T Therapy After Second-line Hormonal Treatment ("SPLASH") trial. SPLASH assesses PNT2002 in patients with PSMA-expressing mCRPC who have progressed on novel anti-androgen therapy and are ineligible or averse to chemotherapy. The study is being conducted in two phases: 1) A 25-patient safety and dosimetry lead-in study (complete) and 2) a 400 patient randomized study (which is still ongoing). The randomization phase of the study started enrolling in September 2021 and is enrolling across North America, Europe and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). We estimate top-line results from this trial in mid-2023. 
PNT2004
PNT2004 is a fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP) targeting program being developed for use in multiple tumor types. FAP is a compelling pan cancer target for imaging and therapy that is expressed in >90% of epithelial tumors. In cancer, FAP is highly expressed on cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which drive tumor progression and resistance to chemo and immunotherapy. FAP is a 170 kDa membrane bound prolyl endopeptidase that is expressed during development but rarely in adult tissues. We believe the lead compound of the PNT2004 program, PNT6555, has best-in-class tumor retention and normal tissue clearance, enabling delivery of large doses of tumor killing radiation.
POINT expects to file a Clinical Trial Application ("CTA") with Health Canada at the end of the first quarter of 2022. The clinical trial is expected to commence in summer 2022 in Canada and will use a n.c.a. 177Lu based PNT6555 therapeutic, supported by a gallium-68 ("68Ga") based PNT6555 molecular imaging agent. 
PNT2003

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PNT2003 is a late stage somatostatin-targeted radioligand in development for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. PNT2003 combines a somatostatin-specific radioligand called DOTATATE with n.c.a. 177Lu. PNT2003’s use of n.c.a. 177Lu could enable it to be administered in outpatient clinics without the need for the clinic to maintain costly dedicated waste streams, providing a unique advantage over the currently approved radiopharmaceutical product for the GEP-NETs indication. PNT2003’s ongoing clinical trial in Canada is being conducted by the University Health Network ("UHN") and Canadian Molecular Probe Consortium ("CanProbe"). POINT received interim data from CanProbe in December 2020. No assurance can be given, however, that the interim results from this trial will result in the successful completion of the clinical trial or that PNT2003 will be approved for commercialization and reimbursement. The last patient last dose for PNT2003’s ongoing clinical trial occurred in July 2021. The sponsor of PNT2003 clinical trial has informed the Company that all patients will have completed the primary follow-up in the second quarter of 2022 and will have data to report to the Company in the second half of 2022. The Company is assessing two distinct pathways for PNT2003 with regulatory authorities. These pathways include a 505(b)(2) with the FDA’s Division of Oncology Products, and an ANDA with the FDA’s Office of Generic Drugs. The Company is currently waiting to complete discussions with the FDA prior to making a public announcement regarding the pathway which will be pursued.
PNT2001
PNT2001 is a next generation PSMA targeting ligand family that leverages linker technology that promotes increased tumor accumulation. The lead candidate in the program shows compelling efficacy as a single dose in preclinical tumor models, with potent anti-tumor activity using 225Ac while also having an improved biodistribution profile versus PSMA ligands currently in late-stage development. This profile could result in the same outcomes seen with today’s technology at a lower dose, potentially allowing for a reduction in the radiopharmaceutical dose. POINT is planning to advance the candidate into investigational new drug ("IND")-enabling studies with the aim to pursue clinical development with 225Ac in the non-metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer ("mHSPC") and post-Lu-PSMA spaces.
CanSEEK
CanSEEK™ has the potential of preventing target engagement outside of the tumor microenvironment ("TME"), which could significantly improve the therapeutic index of targeted radiopharmaceuticals. CanSEEK™ is based on the (d)-Ala-Pro FAP substrate technology, that works by preventing a radioligand from binding to receptors until it has been activated by FAP in the TME. Multiple (d)-Ala-Pro substrate enabled ligands are being studied preclinically against different targets. If successful, the platform has the potential to significantly improve the precision and safety of radioligands.
CanSEEK™ has been sub-licensed from both Bach Biosciences LLC ("Bach Biosciences") and Avacta Life Sciences Limited ("Avacta"), who has branded the technology as pre|CISION™ (an Avacta trademark).
Our Product Candidates
As we discussed above, we are advancing multiple radiopharmaceutical treatments based on peptides and small molecules combined with beta- and alpha-emitting radioisotopes for the treatment of various cancers. Our current pipeline is summarized in the diagram below:
*mCRPC = metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, PSMA = Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen, SSTR = somatostatin receptors, FAP = fibroblast activation protein

Background on Prostate Cancer and PSMA targeting
The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing as the U.S. population ages into older at-risk groups. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 268,000 new prostate cancer cases and over 34,000 deaths due to prostate cancer in the United States in 2022. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men, and with a significant mortality rate, is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In Europe, across the EU-27 countries, the European Cancer Information System estimated that there were approximately 335,000 new prostate cancer cases and over 69,000 deaths as a result of prostate cancer in 2020. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and is the third leading cause of cancer death in men in the EU-27 countries.
PSMA is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein that is overexpressed in prostate cancer but has low expression in normal healthy tissue. Furthermore, PSMA is highly expressed in all states of prostate cancer, including primary and poorly differentiated, metastatic and castrate-resistant disease. This unique expression of PSMA provides the opportunity to design treatments that can be precisely targeted to safely enable the delivery of highly potent drug payloads, while sparing normal healthy tissue. In addition, companion imaging agents are approved which can be used to identify patients whose disease over-expresses PSMA. In December 2020 the FDA approved the first drug for positron emission tomography ("PET") imaging of PSMA positive lesions in men with prostate cancer, 68Ga-PSMA-11. In May 2021, the FDA approved the second PET imaging agent for PSMA imaging 18F-DCFPyL developed by Lantheus Medical Imaging, and in December 2021 the FDA approved Telix Pharmaceuticals’ kit for the preparation of 68Ga-PSMA-11. We believe the approval of PSMA PET agents will facilitate broad access to permit the identification of patients who are likely to benefit from PSMA-targeted treatments, including PNT2002.
Although the five-year survival rate of local and regional prostate cancer is nearly 100%, more aggressive forms of the disease, representing 22% of patients at the time of initial diagnosis, have a substantially poorer prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of only 30%. While these more aggressive forms of prostate cancer can initially be treated, nearly all of these patients experience a recurrence in tumor growth that results in the subsequent development of mCRPC. mCRPC is the most advanced form of the disease and there are approximately 43,000 new incidences of mCRPC in the United States each year. Men with mCRPC have a poor prognosis with a predicted survival rate of only 14.6 months from the initial time of progression. mCRPC represents nearly all prostate cancer-specific deaths.
ARAT therapies such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, darolutamide, or apalutamide are now standard of care for both non-mCRPC and mCRPC following progression and failure on initial hormone therapy. Peak global annual sales of Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga® were $3.5 billion in 2018, with annual sales of $2.5 billion in 2020. Astellas reported global annual sales of Xtandi® for year ended March 2021 exceeding $458 billion Yen (approx. $3.9 billion USD). Finally, Bayer reported that Nubeqa reached sales of $219 million Euros in 2021, driven by US market overperformance, signaling a change in clinical preferences. 
In mCRPC, median radiographic progression-free survival ("rPFS") for first line use of abiraterone was 16.5 months, with ~20% of patients having progressed by the sixth month. Median time that patients received enzalutamide was 16.6 months with 16% having progressed by the sixth month. For most patients, progression is inevitable and as a result there is a large unmet need upon failure of ARAT therapy. In spite of progression while on ARAT, a majority of patients are offered an ARAT switch to avoid the increasingly toxic profile of chemotherapy. Two recent studies have shown that, when patients are switched to a second-line ARAT therapy, rPFS is only approximately four months. As a result, there continues to be a significant need for novel treatment options with the potential to modify or ultimately cure the disease. The incidence of post-ARAT pre-chemotherapy mCRPC patients in the US is greater than 36,000 patients annually.
Our Solution: PNT2002
PNT2002, also referred to as 177Lu-PNT2002, combines a PSMA-specific ligand with the beta-emitting radioisotope 177Lu. PNT2002’s ligand is referred to as “PSMA-I&T” in academic literature and has been used for many years in research and compassionate use settings. PSMA-I&T was developed by Dr. Hans-Jürgen Wester at the Technische Universität München. We created the PNT2002 program by leveraging the data collected in an academic study on PSMA-I&T (Baum RP, et al. 177Lu-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: safety and efficacy), in combination with issued patents and provisional patents pertaining to the formation of the radiopharmaceutical active pharmaceutical ingredient, the manufacturing process and the formulation of the finished product.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Current standard of care for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer who have failed androgen deprivation therapy ("ADT") and ARAT is chemotherapy. The side effects of chemotherapy are significant including neuropathies, nausea, diarrhea, decreased mental capacity and increased risk of infections. PNT2002 has the potential to offer an alternative with significantly fewer side effects compared to chemotherapy, providing patients with a higher quality of life.
A prospective clinical study by Baum, et al. focused on the safety and efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T in patients with progressive mCRPC and increasing levels of prostate-specific antigen ("PSA"). Fifty-six patients were administered a dose of 3.6 to 8.7 gigabecquerel, or GBq, per cycle for one to six cycles, and monitored for morphologic response, response in PSA levels, and overall change in clinical symptoms. Analysis with contrast-enhanced computed tomography ("CT") determined that 20%, 52%, and 28% of patients had partial remission, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. The PSA levels decreased in 80.4% of patients, with the median PSA level reduced from 43.2 ng/mL to 23.8 ng/mL pre- and post-therapy. Progression-free survival ("PFS") was a median of 13.7 months and the median overall survival was not reached after a 28-month follow-up period.
Patients were monitored for side effects for two to four days after each treatment, and vital signs were recorded during administration of the therapy. No clinically significant adverse events were reported during the early monitoring period (i.e. during therapy and for up to four days thereafter) or at the 28-month follow-up time point. Leukocytopenia (grades 1 or 2) occurred only in patients who had received prior long-term chemotherapy. Events of mild, reversible dry mouth, which resolved within three months, occurred in two patients after the third and fourth cycles. No evidence of nephrotoxicity was observed and no clinically significant changes in pre- to post-dosing lab parameters were identified.
We held regulatory discussions with the FDA in 2020, leveraging the data in the Baum research paper to have an end of Phase 2 meeting. The FDA provided feedback on protocol design, dosing dosimetry, control arm, imaging agents and statistical approach regarding our clinical development plans for PNT2002. Leveraging feedback from the FDA, we filed an IND, with the FDA in December 2020 to evaluate the clinical development of PNT2002. The IND was accepted in December 2020. Regulatory discussions were also held with Health Canada in December 2020. Following these discussions, we submitted a clinical trial application for the study. We received a ‘No Objection Letter’, or authorization to proceed, from Health Canada in January 2021.
We initiated patient recruitment for our Phase 3 SPLASH trial in February 2021, and estimate top-line results from this trial in mid-2023. As of March 21, 2022, there are 32 sites currently enrolling in North America and Europe. Site activations in all jurisdictions remain ongoing. We refer to this trial as our SPLASH trial (Study Evaluating Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer Using 177Lu-PNT2002 PSMA Therapy After Second Line Hormonal Treatment). All patients will undergo PSMA biomarker imaging as part of screening to confirm PSMA expression eligibility, as evaluated by central review. The study commenced with dosing 27 patients in the safety and dosimetry lead-in and proceeded to a randomization treatment phase in approximately 400 patients in September 2021 who will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to: 177Lu-PNT2002 (Arm A) versus enzalutamide (160 mg orally qd) or abiraterone (1000 mg orally qd with: 5 mg bid prednisone or 0.5 mg qd dexamethasone) (Arm B). We anticipate Arm B to result in a median PFS of approximately 4 months based on results in previous clinical studies (3.7 months, De Bono et al. N Engl J Med 2020; 382:2091-2102, 4.1 months: Sweeney et al. AACR 2020). All patients who progress in Arm B will have the opportunity to crossover and receive treatment.
Patients in Arm A will receive a 6.8 GBq dose of 177Lu-PNT2002 for 4 cycles, 8 weeks apart, for a maximum cumulative dose of 27.2 GBq. Patients in Arm B may be eligible to crossover to 177Lu PNT2002 every 8 weeks for 4 cycles after radiographic progression per central review. All patients will be followed in long-term follow-up for at least 5 years from the first therapeutic dose, death, or loss to follow. The primary endpoint of the trial is rPFS. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate ("ORR") and overall survival. 
In February 2022 we published dosimetry data from the 27 patients dosed in the safety and dosimetry lead-in cohort for the Company’s Phase 3 SPLASH trial evaluating PNT2002 for the treatment of mCRPC at the 2022 SNMMI Mid-Winter & ACNM Annual Meeting on February 25-27, 2022. The abstract was made public on the first day of the conference. Radiation dosimetry of PNT2002 was calculated in 27 patients with mCRPC based on biodistribution data from planar whole-body conjugate imaging at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours and, for 7 of them, SPECT/CT imaging at 48-72 hours post injection of their first cycle of PNT2002 (6.8±10% GBq). Data from the abstract titled “Dosimetry Results from the SPLASH Trial” (Abstract #: MWMA2244) demonstrated the following:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

•Organs receiving the largest absorbed doses were the lacrimal glands at 1.2 Gy/GBq, followed by the kidneys at 0.73 Gy/GBq.
•The average dose to the salivary glands and red marrow was 0.34 Gy/GBq and 0.034 Gy/GBq, respectively.
•For a cumulative administered activity of 27.2 GBq, i.e. four cycles of 6.8 GBq, the kidneys would receive a cumulative absorbed dose of 19.9 Gy, and the red marrow, 0.91 Gy.
•SPECT/CT vs planar-based kidney dosimetry was consistent across most subjects (±20%) where SPECT/CT images were available with a mean kidney absorbed dose difference of 1%.
In January 2021, we entered into an Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial Agreement with Cornell University and The New York and Presbyterian Hospital to provide PNT2002 for a Phase I/II clinical study being performed by the investigator. The investigator-initiated Phase I/II clinical trial will involve the PNT2002 study drug for progressive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. We are not receiving remuneration in connection with the study, and the agreement provides the investigator anticipates it will take three years following receipt of PNT2002 to complete the study and submit the data for publication.
PNT2004
Background on Fibroblast Activation Protein-α and Fibroblast Activation Protein-α Inhibitors
An exciting development in cancer research has been the discovery that the tumor microenvironment exhibits unique characteristics from healthy tissue. Several tumors, including breast, colon, prostate and pancreatic, develop a dense fibrous tissue comprised of CAFs around and within the tumor. CAFs can contribute up to 90% of the tumor mass. The CAFs of malignant tumors express FAP, a type II membrane-bound glycoprotein with peptidase activity. FAP is unique in that it is expressed in over 90% of epithelial cancers, but generally is not present on healthy cells. Given that FAP is expressed in the majority of cancers and that FAP positive CAFs are involved in tumor progression and supporting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, it is believed that targeting this protein is a potential strategy to attack malignant tumors.
Initial imaging studies of 68Ga-FAP inhibitors (“FAPI”) PET/CT suggested that these tracers are suitable for diagnostic cancer solutions and radioligand therapies. It was determined that even lesions that were already unequivocally identified radiologically could be characterized in additional detail through FAPIs. A retrospective analysis reviewing the development of quinoline-based FAPIs, conducted by Kratochwil and published in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine in 2019, illustrated that the technology has promising clinical applications. The study concluded that several cancers, including lung, breast, esophagus, pancreatic, head-neck, and colorectal cancer, presented high uptake on FAPI. The overexpression of FAP in cancers which have limited treatment options and low five-year survival rates present a significant market opportunity in an area of unmet need.
Our Solution: PNT2004
Most targeted radioligand therapies are designed to target a limited number of cancers by targeting a receptor that is present on tumor cells of a specific type of tissue, such as prostate, but absent in all other healthy tissues. As FAP is highly expressed on a wide range of solid tumors, a FAP specific radioligand offers the potential for a tissue agnostic opportunity that could enable the precise treatment of a variety of solid tumors independent of tissue origin. PNT2004 is a radioligand that targets FAP invented by Dr. William Bachovchin at Tufts University. We licensed worldwide rights to PNT2004 from Bach Biosciences in April 2020.
A clinical candidate – PNT6555 - was identified from a screen of FAP inhibitors for our PNT2004 program. The clinical candidate was characterized in preclinical studies using Fox Chase SCID mice bearing HEK-mFAP tumor xenografts. In studies with 177Lu the compound was found to have a significant amount of the injected dose accumulate in xenograft tissue (~16% of the injected dose/gram, %ID/g), with normal tissues showing little accumulation. After 24 hours the amounts of 177Lu labeled compound in healthy tissue were less than 2% ID/g, with ~24% ID/g accumulating in xenograft tissue, and after 7 days ~11% ID/g remained in xenograft tissue. In survival studies, mice bearing tumors of approximately 200 mm3 were dosed with the 177Lu labeled compound (15 MBq, 30 MBq and 60 MBq) or control. Anti-tumor activity was found at all tested dose levels and the response was dose-dependent. Complete regressions occurred in 6 of 6 mice in the 60 MBq cohort and 3 of 6 in the 30 MBq cohort. Prolonged survival was found in all dose cohorts versus the controls, with 100% survival in the 30 MBq and 60 MBq dose cohorts surviving at the end of the study.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Company completed a pre-CTA meeting with Health Canada in December 2021 regarding the development pathway and clinical study design for the upcoming Phase 1 trial and expects to file a CTA with Health Canada at the end of the first quarter of 2022.
The clinical trial is expected to commence in summer 2022 in Canada and will use a 68Ga-based PNT6555 molecular imaging agent to select patients to receive a n.c.a. 177Lu-based PNT6555 therapeutic agent. Additional preclinical studies in syngeneic and Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models for monotherapy and combination treatment are in development and include other therapeutic isotopes such as 225Ac.
PNT2003
Background on Neuroendocrine Tumors and Somastatin Targeting
Neuroendocrine tumors ("NETs") are rare, heterogenous tumors that originate in neuroendocrine cells, and frequently arise in the gastroenteropancreatic and respiratory systems. NETs are the second most common neoplasm of the diffuse endocrine system. Because of their low incidence and prevalence among the population, NETs are considered an orphan disease. However, there has been a trend towards rising incidence in recent years, especially for NETs located in the lungs, small intestine and rectum.
According to an analysis performed using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program research data, there was a prevalence of 187,000 NETs in the U.S. in 2016 and an estimate of 33,000 newly diagnosed cases. The American Society of Clinical Oncology estimates that 50% of the NETs originate in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, 30% in the lung and the remainder in various sites including the adrenal glands, thyroid and pituitary among others.
GEP-NETs are a rare type of tumor that can form in the pancreas or in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum and appendix. GEP-NETs, sometimes called carcinoid tumors or islet cell tumors, usually form in cells that secrete hormones and can either be benign or malignant. Non-GEP-NETs, includes neuroendocrine tumors of the lung, thyroid, adrenal, ovary, kidney, pituitary, and unknown origin. The five- and ten-year overall survival for GEP-NETs is ~22 – ~56% and ~7 – ~28% respectively, while patients with metastatic disease have significantly worse ten-year overall survival across all NET subtypes than those with local disease. The five- and ten-year overall survival rate for lung NETs which makes up the majority of non-GEP-NETs is 33.7% and 17.3%, respectively, while for NETs of unknown origin (second largest non-GEP NET grouping) five and ten-year overall survival rate is 38% and 22%, respectively.
NETs are characterized by overexpression of somatostatin receptors, which are protein receptors that sense molecules outside of the cell and activate cellular responses to somatostatin. Somatostatin is an important regulator of the endocrine system, and the overexpression of these receptors in NETs, particularly the SSTR2 receptor, creates a target for radioligand therapy to bind to and provide treatment.
NETs are difficult to diagnose because patients often remain asymptomatic in the early stages of the cancer, and symptoms that are exhibited are not unique to NETs. According to some reports, over 50% of NET patients have metastases at diagnosis, upon which NETs cannot be effectively treated with surgery alone and there is a need for alternative therapeutics to provide additional treatment.
NETs are characteristically insensitive to chemotherapeutic agents due to their slow proliferation. In generally small studies (n = 20-85 GEP-NET patients), combination chemotherapy using various anti-proliferative agents (e.g. fluorouracil, streptozotocin, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, interferon-alpha) has yielded typical response rates of less than 40%, duration of response as low as 3 – 8 months and median overall survival of 10 – 40 months.
There are a limited number of therapeutic approaches targeting somatostatin in NETs. Novartis’ Sandostatin, which generated $1.4 billion in 2020 sales, is a somatostatin analogue that controls clinical syndromes associated with NETs but does not treat the metastatic NETs themselves. Ipsen S.A.’s Somatuline, which generated €1.1 billion in 2020 sales, was approved in December 2014 for the treatment of adult with differentiated, locally advanced or metastatic GEP-NETs. Novartis’ Lutathera® is another radioligand therapy using 177Lu-DOTATATE that was approved in January 2018 for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive gastreoenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in adults. Lutathera® received an orphan drug designation from the FDA and is the first available FDA-approved Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy. Novartis reported sales of $445 million for Lutathera® in 2020. While these therapies have brought treatment options to patients with GEP-NETs, the scope of the approved indications creates a significant need for a novel approach to treatments for non-GEP-NET patients.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The options for non-GEP-NET patients are more limited. Afinitor (everolimus) is approved for lung NETs. If a lung NET is detected early enough it will be treated first with a Somatostatin Analogue ("SSA") and then a combination of SSA and Afinitor upon progression. However, Afinitor has a challenging side effect profile with 42% of NETs patients in the pivotal trial experiencing serious adverse events, including death. Following treatment with SSA and Afinitor, there is no clear treatment paradigm for lung NETs, leaving patients and physicians choosing between clinical trials or chemotherapy. With lung NET cancers accounting for nearly 30% of all NETs, this represents a large unmet need for patients.
Our Solution: PNT2003
PNT2003, also known as 177Lu Octreotate ("177Lu-DOTATATE"), is a somatostatin-targeted radioligand therapy in development for the treatment of patients with somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumors, targeting both GEP-NETs and non-GEP-NETs. PNT2003 is the subject of an ongoing multi-center trial in Canada sponsored by CanProbe (a joint venture between the Centre for Probe Development and Commercialization ("CPDC") and UHN) that is designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy across patients with NETs who have positive somatostatin receptor expression identified by 68Ga DOTATATE PET. The last patient last dose occurred in July 2021.
We licensed worldwide rights to the clinical data and the intellectual property for the radiopharmaceutical compound from CanProbe in December 2020. CanProbe’s intellectual property for PNT2003 covers methods of preparing, pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment of various indications including neuroendocrine tumors. 
Although PNT2003 uses the same molecular entity as Novartis’ Lutathera®, PNT2003 uses a different type of 177Lu, called n.c.a. 177Lu. By using n.c.a. 177Lu, PNT2003 will not contain any metastable lutetium-177m ("177mLu"), an impurity introduced into Lutathera’s via the production method of its carrier-added 177Lu. The introduction of the 177mLu impurity in Lutathera® is problematic for hospitals and clinics as 177mLu is a radionuclide with a half-life of 5+ months, which can necessitate the need for dedicated waste streams and other burdensome overhead for physicians and clinics. We believe PNT2003’s use of n.c.a. 177Lu will therefore provide a competitive advantage. PNT2003 could be further differentiated from Lutathera® in the indication it is targeting (non-GEP-NETs), which is not included in Lutathera’s current label and for which there are limited treatment options.
Clinical Development and Next Steps
PNT2003 is currently the subject of an ongoing open-label, single-arm study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PNT2003 across patients with NETs who have positive somatostatin receptor expression identified by 68Ga DOTATATE PET. The interim data received from CanProbe in December 2020 included 167 patients across GEP-NETs as well as neuroendocrine tumors of other tissue origins including lung, thyroid, adrenal, ovary, kidney, pituitary, and unknown origin, collectively referred to as non-GEP-NETs. The breakdown of patients is 33 non-GEP-NET patients and 134 GEP-NET patients.
POINT received interim data from CanProbe in December 2020 that demonstrated that progression-free survival at 12 months is trending towards 83.6% and 90.9% for non-GEP-NET and GEP-NET patients, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 24.8 months and 33.3 months for non GEP-NET and GEP-NET patients, respectively. PNT2003 was found to be well-tolerated with manageable acute and delayed toxicity. As of March 21, 2022, POINT has been notified that there have been 19 serious treatment-related adverse events, which consisted of abdominal pain, colonic perforation, diarrhea, edema, allergic reaction, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, back pain, intracranial hemorrhage, carcinoid crisis, malignant hypertension, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. There have been no other reported serious treatment-related adverse events. Additionally, the overall response rate per RECIST 1.1 by Investigator assessment was 19% and 24% for non-GEP-NET and GEP-NETs patients, respectively. The last patient dose for PNT2003’s ongoing clinical trial occurred in July 2021. The sponsor of PNT2003 clinical trial has informed the Company that all patients will have completed the primary follow-up in the second quarter of 2022 and will have data to report to the Company in the second half of 2022. The Company is assessing two distinct pathways for PNT2003 with FDA. These pathways include a 505(b)(2) and an ANDA with the Office of Generic Drugs. The Company is currently waiting to complete discussions with the FDA prior to making a public announcement regarding the pathway which will be pursued.
PNT2001 — Next-generation PSMA Targeted Radioligand
Background
We estimate that there will be 269,000 new cases of prostate cancer in 2022. Of these patients, approximately 4% will be newly diagnosed with mHSPC, another 34% will progress from biochemical recurrent disease and finally another 26% of patients that will have their case misdiagnosed from traditional imaging methods. Therefore, we estimate that nearly

TABLE OF CONTENTS

40,000 patients diagnosed in 2022 will require lifelong androgen deprivation therapy. These men often live 15 years or more on androgen deprivation therapy and suffer with erectile dysfunction, loss of bone density and bone fractures, loss of muscle mass and physical strength, weight gain, mood swings and fatigue. There is therefore an unmet need in this patient population to delay the need for lifelong androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.
PSMA is expressed in approximately 80% of prostate cancer tumors and is present at all stages of the disease. PSMA expression significantly increases in locally advanced, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases as compared to primary tumors. Given the expression of PSMA throughout all stages of the disease there is potential that PSMA targeting radioligands could help to delay the need for ADT. Radiopharmaceutical development programs that are in late-stage development, including PNT2002, may not be suitable for the treatment of mHSPC due to off target accumulation in kidney which creates the potential for delayed renal toxicity that could manifest given these men live for 15 years or more; therefore, there is an opportunity for next-generation PSMA radioligands with less off target accumulation to fill this gap.
Our Solution: PNT2001
PNT2001 is a next-generation PSMA radioligand family of drug candidates licensed from Scintomics GmbH that have an improved biodistribution profile compared to current generation PSMA targeted radioligands such as PNT2002 and therefore has the potential to be used earlier in disease progression. As demonstrated in the pre-clinical animal model studies, PNT2001 ligands have unique linker technology that enables increased tumor accumulation, potentially enabling lower doses of radioisotope to reduce off target toxicity while allowing for the same level of tumor kill.
Pre-clinical studies of the lead candidate have resulted in the identification of a lead candidate which, as compared to other late-stage PSMA targeted radioligands, demonstrates potent anti-tumor activity using 225Ac, while also having an improved biodistribution profile. POINT has advanced the lead candidate into IND-enabling studies which are expected to support an IND/CTA submission in the first half of 2023. The clinical development pathway being considered for PNT2001 is in recurrent hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and post-Lu-PSMA prostate cancer.

CanSEEKTM
Unlike our other product candidates, CanSEEKTM is not a radiopharmaceutical. It is a prodrug technology platform which can be applied to a wide variety of radioligands to refine their targeting precision. The goal of CanSEEKTM is to enable the creation of tumor activated radioligand therapies, which have higher therapeutic indexes then their non-tumor activated counterparts.
Background
One of the most commonly raised concerns about radiation therapy is that off-tissue delivery of radiation can damage otherwise healthy tissue. For example, with PSMA-targeted therapies, kidney and salivary gland uptake are of concern. These concerns are amplified when patient life expectancy is long, as the effects of radiation toxicity can take long periods of time to manifest. The risk of damaging healthy tissue may also increase as new higher energy radioisotopes like 225Ac are used, increasing the importance of off-target damage mitigation strategies.
Our solution: CanSEEKTM
Due to our interest in introducing radioligand therapies earlier in the treatment setting with a wider variety of radioisotopes, we began investigating technologies which could be used to increase the therapeutic index of radiopharmaceuticals. These investigations lead to the work of Dr. William Bachovchin of Tufts University / Bach Biosciences, which had previously invented a prodrug technology to increase the therapeutic index of chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin. Dr. Bachovchin’s technology had been licensed to a U.K.-based life sciences firm named Avacta Life Sciences, who subsequently branded the technology as pre | CISIONTM. We have secured a sub-licensing agreement with Bach Biosciences and Avacta that provides us the right to apply the technology to radiopharmaceuticals globally.
CanSEEKTM could decrease the risks associated with off-target delivery of radiopharmaceuticals by limiting their ability to bind with receptors on healthy cells. The way CanSEEKTM achieves this is by using the presence of fibroblast-activation proteins, which is expressed in over 90% of epithelial cancers but not expressed in healthy cells, as a switch that activates the radioligand. The following image visually explains how CanSEEKTM works:
16


TABLE OF CONTENTS

CanSEEKTM is first conjugated with the radioligand, which effectively blocks the radioligand from binding to receptors. The presence of FAP in the tumor microenvironment then cleaves the prodrug off the radioligand. Once the prodrug is removed, the radioligand can once again bind to cancer cell receptors. If the radioligand does not enter the tumor microenvironment, the prodrug remains conjugated to it and is eliminated from the body without accumulating in off-target tissues expressing the receptor.
Preclinical Data and Next Steps
POINT has not published substantial preclinical data from CanSEEKTM. Multiple (d)-Ala-Pro substrate enabled ligands are currently being studied preclinically against different targets.
Commercialization
None of POINT’s product candidates have received the regulatory approvals required to begin commercialization. We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to either commercialize our investigational products on our own or with a partner, in the U.S. and other regions. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and sales, marketing and commercial product distribution capabilities for the U.S., and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our investigational product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population and the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs and economics related to the foregoing may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid advancement of novel technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our technology and scientific expertise and manufacturing capabilities provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from multiple sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and public and private research organizations.
Radiopharmaceuticals are being explored in several different settings, including both commercial and academic clinical trials. Results from these trials combined with recent product approvals have garnered continued interest in the space by both large pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, which are developing both early-stage and later-stage radiopharmaceutical candidates.
Given the nature of our product candidates, we consider our most direct competitors to be other companies focusing on beta-based radiopharmaceuticals, both in development and already approved. There are multiple companies, including Lantheus Holdings, Novartis AG, Bayer and Q BioMed Inc., with approved beta-based radiopharmaceutical products using isotopes such as 131I, 177Lu, Sr and Y. Novartis’ Lutathera® is a prominent beta-based radiopharmaceutical, and other beta-based radiopharmaceuticals are in various stages of clinical development by companies including Novartis AG, Ipsen S.A., Curium SAS, Nordic Nanovector, Cellectar Biosciences, ITM Isotope Technologies Munich SE, Clovis Oncology and Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc.
There are also several companies developing targeted alpha radiopharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer, including Bayer AG, or Bayer, Novartis AG, or Novartis, Telix Pharmaceuticals Limited, Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., RadioMedix, Inc., Orano Med, Viewpoint Molecular Targeting, Atkis Oncology, Fusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., RayzeBio, Inc., Aktis Oncology, Inc., and Curie Therapeutics, Inc. These companies use various alpha-emitting isotopes such as 
17


TABLE OF CONTENTS

223Ra, 225Ac and 227Th. Most alpha-based radiopharmaceuticals are in clinical development, with Bayer’s Xofigo® being the only approved alpha particle-based therapy. Xofigo® was approved in 2013 for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
For our product candidates PNT2002 and PNT2001, we are aware of several competing therapies targeting metastatic prostate cancer. Our closest competitor is Novartis’ PSMA-617, which uses 177Lu for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and recently announced a positive result for its Phase 3 trial, with FDA & EU approvals expected in the first half of 2022. We are aware of the following companies with prostate cancer preclinical and development programs: Janssen, CTT, Novartis, BlueEarth, Curium, Telix and Lantheus. In addition, we expect to face indirect competition from established treatments of prostate cancer, including Jevtana® (Sanofi), Zytiga® (Johnson & Johnson), Xtandi® (Astellas Pharma and Pfizer), Erleada® (Johnson & Johnson), Lynparza® (AstraZeneca) and Xofigo® & Nubeqa® (Bayer). While we believe PNT2002 and PNT2001 could have significant competitive advantages compared to established treatments for prostate cancer (such as being used at different stages of disease), we may still face competition from these more established treatments.
For our product candidate PNT2003, we are aware of several competing therapies targeting neuroendocrine tumors. Novartis’ Lutathera®, which was approved in 2018, uses 177Lu for the treatment of patients with somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine cancers. We are aware of the following companies with neuroendocrine tumor, radioligand preclinical and development programs: ITM, Ipsen and Radiomedix. We also face potential competition from other treatments targeting neuroendocrine tumors such as Sandostatin® and Afinitor® (Novartis), Somatuline® (Ipsen) and Sutent® (Pfizer). While we believe PNT2003 has significant advantages (such as its usage of n.c.a. 177Lu) compared to conventional approaches to neuroendocrine tumors, we may still face competition from these more established treatments.
For our product candidate PNT2004, competitive threats include those candidates that are in development or currently approved for whatever indications which our product candidate may be developed. Given the preclinical stage of PNT2004, the specific indications that our product candidate may target is still under consideration, and specific competitors will become identified as our program develops. There are other early-stage programs targeting FAP, including Clovis Oncology, Novartis, Philogen Spa and SOFIE, which may directly compete with our candidate as either an imaging agent and/or therapeutic agent. However, given the early development stage of these product candidates, it is unclear whether they will be in direct competition with PNT2004.
CanSEEKTM, our tumor microenvironment targeting prodrug platform, is too early stage to identify direct competitors. While there are some companies such as Fusion Pharmaceuticals with early-stage technologies which hope to enhance the safety of actinium-based radiopharmaceuticals, the goals of our tumor microenvironment targeting prodrug platform extend beyond 225Ac-focused programs to increase the therapeutic of radiopharmaceuticals regardless of isotope used.
Many of the companies that we are competing against have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, and marketing approved products than we do. Furthermore, the merger and acquisition or other strategic transactions involving these companies may result in resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. If our competition develops a product that is safer or more effective than ours or brings a product to market faster than we can, we could see a negative impact on our commercial success. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are their efficacy, safety, convenience for doctors and patients, price, competitive branded and generic products, and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and develop a robust intellectual property portfolio for our technology and product candidates, as well as on our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights. We generally seek to protect our product candidates and technology by seeking patent protection that would enhance clinical development and commercial success. We intend to continue relying upon patent protection, exclusivity pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities. 
As of March 21, 2022, our patent portfolio of owned and exclusively licensed patent filings included ten different patent families with pending and issued patents in the U.S. and other major markets, with several of the existing patent families still affording additional opportunities for worldwide filings. Our portfolio includes both in-licensed and internally developed intellectual property to protect our programs. Estimated expiry dates for our patent portfolio range from 2038 to 2043, with additional potential patent term adjustment and patent term extensions available in major markets and various other jurisdictions to extend the duration of patent protection.

In addition, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on March 15, 2021, RACA entered into subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and RACA agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors, an aggregate of 16,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $165,000,000 (the “PIPE Financing”). The PIPE Financing was consummated concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination. We received net proceeds of approximately $260.0 million consisting of proceeds of the PIPE Financing and the proceeds remaining in RACA’s trust account. Transaction costs of approximately $27.0 million consisted of investment banker, legal, audit, tax, accounting, consulting, insurance, board retainer fees and listing fees.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products, such as those we are developing and any other product candidates we may develop. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes strict, joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites, including releases of radioactive materials, regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination, the Low-level Radioactive Waste Policy Act ("LLRW Policy Act"), which requires the safe disposal of mildly radioactive materials that cannot be decayed in storage, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ("NRC") regulations concerning various irradiated and radioactive, materials, and health regulations from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which limit exposures to hazardous substances, including radioactive materials, in the workplace and impose various worker safety requirements.
We, along with third-party contractors, are also required to comply with the various preclinical, clinical, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of PNT2001, PNT2002, PNT2003, PNT2004, CanSEEKTM or any future drug candidate. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and effectiveness must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
FDA Drug Development and Approval Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates and any future drug product candidates we may develop must be approved by the FDA through a new drug application (“NDA”), the vehicle through which drug sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for sale and marketing in the United States. NDAs can be divided into the following four categories: 
1.A stand-alone NDA is an application submitted under section 505(b)(1) and approved under section 505(c) of the FDCA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness that were conducted by or for the applicant or for which the applicant has a right of reference or use. 
2.A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) and approved under section 505(c) of the FDCA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use.
3.An ANDA is an application submitted and approved under section 505(j) of the FDCA for a drug product that is a duplicate of a previously approved drug product. An ANDA relies on FDA’s finding that the previously approved drug product, i.e., the reference listed drug (RLD) is safe and effective. An ANDA generally must contain information to show that the proposed generic product (1) is the same as the RLD with respect to the active ingredient(s), conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and labeling (with certain permissible differences) and (2) is bioequivalent to the RLD. An ANDA may not be submitted if clinical investigations are necessary to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product. 
4.A petitioned ANDA is a type of ANDA for a drug product that differs from the RLD in its dosage form, route of administration, strength, or active ingredient (in a product with more than one active ingredient) and for which FDA has determined, in response to a petition submitted under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the FDCA (suitability petition), that studies are not necessary to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product. A petitioned ANDA is generally expected to provide the same therapeutic effect as the listed drug that was relied on as the basis of the suitability petition. 
There are other preliminary steps that must be conducted prior to the submission of a NDA. The FDA review and approval process for drugs generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices (“GLP”) requirements;
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for each proposed indication;
•preparation and submission of the NDA to the FDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials that includes substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness from results of nonclinical and clinical trials, and satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements;
•potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA Advisory Committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug for the intended indications in the U.S.
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies, Development and IND Submission
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

An IND sponsor must submit the results of its preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP and regulations governing the protection of human research subjects, including the requirement that all research subjects provide voluntary informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial.
Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The IRB is responsible for ensuring that human subject’s rights and privacy are maintained. Regulatory authorities, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (“DSMB”), which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The DSMB may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
•Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. For oncologic diseases with high unmet medical need Phase 2 trials with primary endpoints considered a validated surrogate for clinical effectiveness may support accelerated approval. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger, confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the statistically significant data necessary to demonstrate or confirm the effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In some cases, the FDA may require Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition for approval of the NDA. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
NDA Submission, Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA (unless a waiver or exemption applies).
Once a NDA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing (a 60-day process), or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
The FDA reviews a NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective and that the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety and effectiveness. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing processes, or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA, except that, where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the complete response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the complete response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might undertake to resolve any findings and place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or effectiveness of a product.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Even if approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). The FDA may also review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. The review clock does not begin until the final section of the NDA is submitted.
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. If signed into law, the Promising Pathway Act (S. 1644), introduced in the U.S. Senate in May 2021, would reform the accelerated approval pathway by, among other things, requiring sponsors to supply data to patient registries for “provisionally” approved drugs and allows the FDA to withdraw provisional approval if a significant number of patients experience serious adverse effects compared to available therapies.
Fast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation in and of itself does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. However, a drug granted orphan status allows the sponsor to receive tax credits and a user fee waiver.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Pediatric Information
Section 504 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 ("FDARA") amended section 505B of the FDCA to require—for original applications submitted on or after August 18, 2020—pediatric investigations of certain targeted cancer drugs with new active ingredients, based on molecular mechanism of action rather than clinical indication. Specifically, if an original NDA for a new active ingredient, and the drug that is the subject of the application is intended for treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer, reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation must be submitted with the marketing application, unless FDA formally waives or defers the requirement after submission of an initial Pediatric Study Plan. 
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, product sampling and distribution, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, most modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, are subject to FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. Even with our facility in Indianapolis, Indiana being operational, we may also rely on third parties for the production of clinical supply of our product candidates in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violations, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of post-approval problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, mandated modification of promotional materials or the issuance of corrective information, issuance by FDA or other regulatory authorities of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulation
The pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations, including those related to healthcare fraud and abuse, privacy and security of health information and other personal data, transparency of financial relationships, registration of manufacturers and distributors, and marketing. These laws and regulations are broadly applicable, may vary across jurisdictions, and are administered by several different government agencies, including the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). Further, these laws and regulations are subject to change, enforcement practices may evolve, and it is difficult to predict the impact of new laws and regulations. Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
Fraud and Abuse
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for items or services covered by a federal healthcare program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and have held that there is a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be punished by criminal fines, imprisonment, substantial civil monetary penalties, damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) as a false or fraudulent claim.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil FCA, govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit individuals and entities from making false claims or statements. The FCA may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a private individual, acting as a “whistleblower,” on behalf of the federal government. There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA, including knowingly, which is defined broadly, submitting a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government or submitting claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Parties can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not directly submit claims to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims. If a defendant is determined to have violated the FCA, they may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim and potential exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Additionally, individuals or entities may be subject to criminal penalties under the criminal FCA.
Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed under other statutes that prohibit various forms of fraud and abuse. For example, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMP Law”), which requires a lower burden of proof than some other 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

fraud and abuse laws, provides for penalties for a variety of healthcare fraud violations. These include, but are not limited to, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary knowing that such action is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of items or services payable by federal healthcare programs, unless an exception applies. The CMP Law authorizes the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) to seek civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may impose additional liability for the types of acts prohibited by federal law. Some state laws apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
Privacy and Security
Privacy and security regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (“protected health information”), provide for individual privacy-related rights, require safeguards for protected health information and require notification of breaches of unsecure protected health information. Entities subject to HIPAA include health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and most healthcare providers. Entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities (known as business associates) are required to comply with certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations. Violations of HIPAA may result in substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties. HHS enforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents.
There are several other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security of personal information. These laws vary, and noncompliance may result in penalties or other disincentives. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) affords consumers expanded privacy protections effective January 1, 2020. The California Privacy Rights Act took effect January 1, 2022, and significantly modifies the CCPA. These laws give California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. In addition to civil penalties for violations, the laws provide for a private right of action for data breaches. Although information collected, used or disclosed in research, including clinical trials, and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the CCPA, our other personal information collection practices may be subject to the CCPA. Foreign laws, including for example the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, and may differ significantly from HIPAA.
The costs associated with developing and maintaining systems to comply with data privacy and security laws, defending against privacy and security related claims or enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines can be substantial.
Sunshine Laws
The federal government and certain state governments have enacted laws, sometimes referred to as “sunshine laws” that aim to increase transparency in financial relationships between manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical supplies and healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. These laws generally require manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals and to disclose ownership and investment interests held by healthcare professionals and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, CMS collects data submitted by manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by federal healthcare programs and publishes the data on its public Open Payments website. In addition, some states have sunshine laws that are broader than the federal law by requiring the reporting of a larger set of payments or activities and including additional types of healthcare professionals or entities. Failure to comply with sunshine laws may result in sanctions, including civil monetary penalties.
Pharmaceutical Industry Compliance
Manufacturers and distributors of drug products are subject to state laws requiring registration with the state, which may extend to manufacturers and distributors that ship products into a state even if they do not have a place of business within the state. The federal government and some state governments also require manufacturers and distributors to maintain records regarding the history of products in the chain of distribution. Federal law requires manufacturers to 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

provide product tracing information to subsequent supply chain partners. The federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) governs the system of tracing certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the U.S., with the goal of protecting consumers from drugs that may be counterfeit, contaminated, stolen, or adulterated. This law requires manufacturers to, prior to or at the time of each transfer of ownership of a drug, provide the next owner with transaction history and other information. In the event of a recall or an inquiry regarding a potentially illegitimate product, manufacturers must be able to provide information regarding the transaction history and other information about the products. Violations of the DSCSA may result in fines or imprisonment. Many states have similar laws and enforce recordkeeping and licensure requirements.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the HHS OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, which is guidance designed to help companies prevent fraud and abuse within federal healthcare programs, and other relevant government-issued compliance guidance. Several states require pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to publicly disclose sales information, marketing expenditures, drug pricing, clinical trials and other activities. Several states require pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, require registration of sales representatives, prohibit manufacturers from acquiring certain physician prescribing data for use in sales and marketing activities and prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, various federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws may also apply. Violation of laws governing the pharmaceutical industry may result in penalties such as criminal fines, imprisonment, civil fines, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and additional reporting obligations and oversight.
Federal price reporting laws require many pharmaceutical manufacturers to calculate and report certain pricing metrics, such as average sales price (“ASP”) and best price, which may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and discounts on approved products. Penalties may apply if these metrics are not submitted timely and accurately.
Reimbursement and Pricing
Payment for healthcare items and services in the U.S. comes primarily from third-party payors, including government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors. Coverage and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products can differ significantly between payors.
Sales of pharmaceutical products are materially affected by the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the product. A decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product may impact utilization. At the same time, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not mean that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Securing coverage and reimbursement for a product (often two separate processes) may involve conducting expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of a product, in addition to the studies required to obtain FDA or comparable regulatory approvals. Drugs administered under the supervision of a physician often have high price points, which may make obtaining adequate reimbursement from payors particularly difficult.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of both commercial payors and government healthcare programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices, examining medical necessity and reviewing cost-effectiveness of medical products and services as they seek to control costs. For example, payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication, or they may require substitution of generic products. Adoption of, or enhancement of existing, price controls and other cost-containment measures may limit revenue. Drug prices may also be reduced by discounts or rebates required by payors and future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from other countries.
The marketability of any drug candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may be negatively impacted if commercial payors and government healthcare programs do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. There is no guarantee that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates, even if the product candidates is FDA-approved. If adequate coverage and reimbursement is not available, we may not be able to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Government Reimbursement
We expect that reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid will eventually be a significant part of our revenues. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. Drug manufacturers must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various government healthcare programs and may also be required to report specific prices to government agencies under these programs.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Medicare is a federal health insurance program for persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicare Part B generally covers medically necessary outpatient care, including physician services and a limited number of outpatient prescription drugs under limited conditions. Medicare Part B typically covers drugs that are not self-administered by a patient, including injectable and infused drugs and oral cancer drugs. Drugs that are not covered under Medicare Part B may be covered under Part D, an optional prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries that is administered by private companies.
Medicaid is a medical assistance program for eligible needy persons that is funded jointly by federal and state governments. Medicaid programs are operated by state agencies under plans approved by the federal government. Reimbursement methodologies, eligibility requirements and covered services vary from state to state. Although pharmacy coverage is an optional benefit under federal law, all states currently provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicaid are required to participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires them to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to certain safety net providers that serve vulnerable or underserved populations. Manufacturers participating in Medicaid are also required to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”), a program intended to help offset the federal and state costs of outpatient prescription drugs. Under this program, manufacturers agree to rebate a specified portion of the Medicaid payment for the drug to the states, and states share the rebates with the federal government based on their federal medical assistance percentage, which is the share of Medicaid spending in each state paid for by the federal government. When a manufacturer enters into an MDRP rebate agreement with HHS, Medicaid agrees to cover nearly all FDA-approved drugs from that manufacturer, effectively creating an open formulary. An MDRP rebate agreement is also required in order for payment to be made available under Medicare Part B for a manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs.
Drug Pricing Policies and Reforms
In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a large number of laws intended to result in significant changes to the healthcare industry, including proposals targeted at reducing the price of pharmaceutical products and limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act"), affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, and the establishment and expansion of value-based purchasing programs. The law also imposes price transparency requirements and established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which focuses on comparative clinical effectiveness research. In addition, the Affordable Care Act contains several provisions relevant to pharmaceutical manufacturers and that may impact our potential product candidates, including expansion of the 340B program, expansion of manufacturers’ rebate liability under the MDRP, and measures intended to reduce Medicare Part D enrollees’ out-of-pocket liability.
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. However, President Biden has indicated that his administration intends to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid programs. Further, the presidential administration and members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, such as single-payor proposals (commonly referred to as “Medicare for All”) and changes to Medicare age requirements. These proposals could lead to increased coverage levels and utilization of services. However, the impact and timing of additional reform initiatives is unclear.
In recent years, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for their products. This has resulted in proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to increase transparency in product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, in 2020, HHS, the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury issued a Transparency in Coverage final rule that for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, requires health plans to disclose on a public website the negotiated rates and historical net pricing for prescription drugs and to provide consumers with personalized cost-sharing information. However, the agencies announced in August 2021 that they will delay enforcement of this requirement until July 1, 2022, due to potentially duplicative and overlapping reporting requirements imposed by the No Surprises Act, which is part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“CAA”). The agencies issued an interim final rule in November 2021 implementing the CAA reporting requirements for health plans, requiring, among other things, information on the most frequently dispensed and costliest drugs, as well as prescription drug rebates paid by drug manufacturers to plans, issuers, third-party administrators and pharmacy benefit managers. Beginning in 2023, the agencies will issue biennial public reports on prescription drug pricing trends and the impact of prescription drug costs on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. 
Some other efforts related to drug pricing reform involve importing drugs from other countries or using international pricing benchmarks. For example, in 2020, HHS and the FDA issued a final rule to allow FDA-authorized programs to

import certain prescription drugs from Canada, although the rule excludes several types of prescription drugs such as radioactive drugs and biologics and imaging drugs. Some states, such as Florida, are pursuing their own initiative to import drugs for state health care programs. Also in 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule to implement a Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) model for determining Medicare prices for Part B drugs and biologicals. However, in 2021, before the MFN model was implemented CMS rescinded the interim final rule and removed the relevant regulations. 
In addition, HHS OIG issued a final rule in 2020 that amends the discount safe harbor of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to exclude rebates from drug manufacturers to Medicare Part D plan sponsors, adds a safe harbor to protect point-of-sale reductions from a drug manufacturer to a Part D or Medicaid managed care organization, and adds a safe harbor to protect certain drug manufacturer payments to pharmacy benefit managers. However, there is ongoing litigation relating to this rule and implementation was delayed pursuant to a court order. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, enacted in November 2021, prohibits HHS from implementing or enforcing the rule prior to January 1, 2026. 
The Biden administration and certain members of Congress have indicated their intent to continue to pursue drug pricing reforms. Proposals include allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug manufacturers for lower prices, allowing additional importation of prescription drugs from other countries, modifying the design of the Medicare Part D program and limiting drug price increases to no more than the inflation rate. Some states also have passed legislation and issued regulations designed to lower prescription drug costs. These and other initiatives at the federal and state levels, if enacted and implemented, may directly or indirectly affect pricing of our product candidates.
Additionally, in 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, (the “Right to Try Act”), was enacted. The law provides a federal framework for eligible patients to access certain investigational drugs that are the subject of an active IND application submitted to the FDA, but that have not been approved or licensed by the FDA for any use. The Right to Try Act allows patients to seek treatment without participating in a clinical trial and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA Expanded Access Program (i.e., compassionate use). Manufacturers are not obligated under the Right to Try Act to make products available to eligible patients. Some states have enacted similar laws.
Canadian Drug Development and Approval Process
In accordance with the Food and Drugs Act and associated Regulations, manufacturers of prescription drug products must receive authorization from Health Canada before prescription drug products may be marketed and sold. There is no assurance that Health Canada will issue an authorization for a product.
In order to obtain authorization, a manufacturer must file a regulatory submission with evidence of safety, efficacy and quality of the proposed drug product. While Health Canada’s review of the evidence and a manufacturer’s response to Health Canada’s inquiries can take as long as several years from the date that the manufacturer files its regulatory submission, it can often be completed within 1 year.
The typical regulatory process for prescription drug approval from pre-market to post-market in Canada, involves:
•preclinical studies, using for example, laboratory studies involving cell or tissue samples, or tests conducted on animals, to collect preliminary safety and efficacy data;
•clinical trials on human subjects, which require authorization by Health Canada to collect further safety and efficacy data;
•a drug submission with Health Canada, including review by Health Canada;
•a market authorization decision by Health Canada and issuance of a notice of compliance; and
•public access to the drug product, subject to post-marketing surveillance, inspection and investigation by Health Canada.
