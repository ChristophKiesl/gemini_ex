Recent Business Changes
‘Kimball International Connect’ Strategy
In May 2019, Kimball International introduced a comprehensive strategy to connect our purpose, our people, and our brands to drive growth and unlock the Company’s full potential. Kimball International Connect seeks to enable the power of our people and position our organization to engage at higher levels of collaboration and interdependence. 
Our Kimball International Connect Strategy is comprised of four pillars:
▪Inspire Our People: Leveraging our legacy of a bold and entrepreneurial spirit, we are working to cultivate a high-performance, caring culture. We are investing in our training, technology and systems to remain an employer of choice and a great place to work.
▪Build Our Capabilities: We created center-led functions, including finance, human resources, information technology and legal and centralized supply chain leadership to reduce duplication, deliver efficiencies, and drive consistency. We are also adopting new ways of working to ensure the use of common best practices and approaches. To achieve our goals, we established a Program Management Office to oversee execution.
▪Fuel Our Future: We are driving lean throughout the organization, removing duplication at the business level, and infusing capital to accelerate efficiencies. Related to this, we are employing a more metrics-based approach and driving toward more formal standardized operating practices. 
▪Accelerate Our Growth: We are continuing to advance new product development across our brands, selectively expanding our verticals and channels, including health and e-commerce, and driving commercial excellence. We believe by being our customers’ first choice for shaping places that bring collaboration, discovery, wellness and relaxation to life, we will capture greater market share. 
‘Kimball International Connect 2.0’ Strategy
In August 2020, Kimball International announced Connect 2.0, which centers around accelerating our growth. The four pillars of our previously announced strategy remain constant: inspire our people with a purpose driven and high performance culture, build our capabilities by expanding our work on innovation, fuel our future through the dedication to cost savings, and accelerate our growth. Connect 2.0 is designed to accelerate the growth of Kimball International and enable us to effectively manage through the current economic downturn, by driving market share gains as well as yielding additional cost savings. The Company has been reorganized into four market centric business units which are Workplace, Health, Hospitality, and eBusiness that will accelerate our ability to redesign and reimagine the new workplace, build a new work from home portfolio, continue assembling experts in health, and expand our hospitality business into other commercial direct sales environments. The dedicated eBusiness unit will take a leadership role in establishing all e-commerce across our brands and end markets. Each of these four business units will be supported by the agility and efficiency of Global Operations and the streamlined center-led structure that we implemented in year one of our strategy and the transformation restructuring plan described below. 
Transformation Restructuring Plan Phase 1
In June 2019, we announced a transformation restructuring plan to optimize resources for future growth, improve efficiency, and build capabilities across our organization. We believe phase 1 of our transformation restructuring plan has established a more cost-efficient structure to better align our operations with our long-term strategic goals. The transformation restructuring plan included the following: 
•We reviewed our overall manufacturing facility footprint to reduce excess capacity and gain efficiencies by centralizing manufacturing operations. We ceased operations at a leased seating manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia, and consolidated a David Edward production facility in Red Lion, Pennsylvania into our Baltimore, Maryland facility.
•The creation of center-led functions for finance, human resources, information technology and legal functions resulted in the standardization of processes and the elimination of duplication. In addition, we centralized our supply chain efforts to maximize supplier value and plan to drive more efficient practices and operations within our logistics function.
•Kimball brand selling resources were reallocated to higher-growth markets. We also ceased use of four leased furniture showrooms across our brands during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. 
Phase 1 of our transformation restructuring plan was substantially complete as of June 30, 2021.
Transformation Restructuring Plan Phase 2
In August 2020, we announced the second phase of our transformation restructuring plan that will align our business units to a new market-centric orientation and is expected to yield additional cost savings that will aid us to effectively manage through the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan builds on the initial strategy and the transformation restructuring plan announced in June 2019. Phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan began in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021, and we expect a substantial majority of the underlying activities of these aforementioned actions 
to be completed by the end of our fiscal year 2023. The following is a summary of the activities we are undertaking pursuant to phase 2 of the transformation restructuring plan:
•As part of the previously announced plan to consolidate manufacturing of all brands into one world-class global operations group, we are streamlining our manufacturing facilities by leveraging production capabilities across all facilities, establishing centers of excellence, and setting up processes to facilitate flexing of product between facilities in response to volume fluctuations. We are also reviewing our overall facility footprint to identify opportunities to reduce capacity and gain efficiencies, including the consolidation of our Baltimore, Maryland facility into other manufacturing facilities.
•We are streamlining our workforce to align with the new organizational structure and respond to lower volumes created by the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a more efficient organization to deliver on our Connect 2.0 strategy.
•During fiscal year 2021, we offered two voluntary retirement incentive programs to eligible employees. Employees electing to participate were paid special termination benefits, including a severance benefit and cash payment that may be used to pay for a period of healthcare coverage or for any other purpose. 
•Starting in fiscal year 2022, many of our showrooms will feature multiple brands thus eliminating the need for more than one showroom in the same city. Showroom locations are being reviewed and select leased showroom locations will be closed. 
Acquisition of Poppin, Inc.
On December 9, 2020, we acquired Poppin, a tech-enabled, market-leading B2B commercial furniture design company headquartered in New York City, New York. Poppin designs commercial-grade furniture that is made to mix, match, and scale in today’s modern office and work-from-home environments. The acquisition purchase price totaled $110.4 million in initial cash consideration plus additional contingent payments of $65.0 million if all remaining revenue and profitability milestones are achieved through June 30, 2024. As of the acquisition date the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability was $31.8 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability decreased to $20.2 million due to Poppin not achieving certain milestones.
Sales and Offerings
We have been in the furniture business since 1950. Our end markets include workplace, health, and hospitality. Our workplace end market includes sales to the commercial, financial, government and education vertical markets and eBusiness.

A table showing our net sales by end market is included in Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Major Competitive Factors
Our products are sold in the contract furniture and hospitality furniture industries. These industries have similar major competitive factors, which include price in relation to quality and appearance, product design, the utility of the product, including adaptability and cleanability, supplier lead time, reliability of on-time delivery, sustainability, and the ability to respond to requests for special and non-standard products. We offer payment terms similar to industry standards and in unique circumstances may grant alternate payment terms. 
Certain industries are more price sensitive than others, but all expect on-time, damage-free delivery. In addition to the many options available on our standard furniture products, custom furniture is produced to customer specifications and shipping timelines on a project basis. We offer several programs that include furniture for a variety of spaces with quick-ship options.
Competitors
There are numerous furniture manufacturers competing within the marketplace, with a significant number of competitors offering similar products. Our competition includes furniture manufacturers such as Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller Inc. (MillerKnoll), HNI Corporation, and a large number of smaller privately-owned furniture manufacturers, both domestic and foreign-based.
Product Development and Trends
Our robust product development process is comprised of ideation, development, and execution. Research informed design is accomplished through partnering with external research firms and utilizing internal and external design intelligence to gain market insights and obtain design validation. Successful new product introductions fuel the growth of our business as they incorporate evolving customer needs with improved manufacturing efficiencies. Products are tested for performance, quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations. We invested approximately $10 million, $5 million, and $6 million in research and development related activities in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition, we periodically pay royalties to external designers as select products are sold. 
Our product designs focus on providing solutions which include addressing trends in the marketplace, such as the evolving flexible workplace environment. Key elements of the evolving flexible workplace include pairing residential elements with highly functional and flexible commercial office offerings that have high cleanability. Within healthcare settings, products are trending toward adaptable designs that are focused on both the patients and the caregivers with a continued focus on cleanability. 
Locations
As of June 30, 2021, our products were primarily produced at nine Company-owned or leased manufacturing facilities: six located in Indiana, two in Kentucky, and one in Mexico. We also engage with third-party manufacturers within the U.S. as well as internationally to produce select finished goods and accessories for our brands. As part of our transformation restructuring plan, near the end of our fiscal year 2021, we are consolidating our Baltimore, Maryland manufacturing facility into other existing locations and are evaluating our production capabilities and capacity across our organization to identify additional opportunities. 
As of June 30, 2021, fifteen furniture showrooms were maintained in ten cities in the United States inclusive of the Poppin showrooms. During fiscal year 2022 we plan to implement a showroom strategy where we highlight our Kimball, National, Etc., and Interwoven brands in shared showroom spaces which will eliminate having multiple showrooms in a single city. Office space is leased in Dongguan and Shenzen, both located in the province of Guangdong, China and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to facilitate sourcing of select finished goods and components from the Asia Pacific Region. We lease office and manufacturing space in Chula Vista, California and Tijuana, Mexico. 
Financial information by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021 is included in Note 18 - Geographic Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Resources
 Raw Material Availability
Certain components used in the production of furniture are manufactured internally and are generally readily available, as are other raw materials used in the production of wood and non-wood furniture. Certain fabricated seating components, wood frame assemblies as well as finished furniture products, electrical components, stone, fabrics, and fabricated metal components, which are generally readily available, are sourced on a global scale in an effort to provide quality products at the lowest total cost. The COVID-19 global pandemic has affected both domestic and global supply chains. Disruptions related to certain specific commodities have begun to ease; however we expect other commodities and components to remain impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic which could increase cost and limit availability of certain raw materials. 
Working Capital
We do not believe that we, or the contract furniture or hospitality furniture industries in general, have any special practices or special conditions affecting working capital items that are significant for understanding our furniture business. We do receive advance payments from customers on select furniture projects, primarily in the hospitality industry.
Intellectual Property
In connection with our business operations, we hold both trademarks and patents in various countries and continuously have additional pending trademarks and patents. The intellectual property which we believe to be the most significant to the Company includes: Kimball, National, D’style, David Edward, Etc. (pending), Poppin, Fringe, Waveworks, Xsite, Narrate, Pairings, Respitality, and Allan Copley Designs, which are all registered trademarks, and the unregistered trademarks Priority and Whittaker. Our patents expire at various times depending on the patent’s date of issuance. 
Seasonality
The impact of seasonality on our revenue includes lower sales to educational institutions during our second and third fiscal quarters, lower sales of hospitality furniture during times of high hotel occupancy such as the summer months, and lower sales in our third fiscal quarter due to the buying season of the government.
Human Capital
Employee Engagement
Employee engagement is a key component of our culture of caring. We conduct employee engagement surveys periodically to take a pulse on our working environment. Recently, our outreach to employees has included a wide range of activities such as targeted pulse surveys across our various business units and functions. The surveys focus on organizational vitality, communication, and returning to work post-COVID. In response to employee feedback, we added new forums to engage our employees:
•Created regular interactive “Executive Chat” sessions where executive team members update the organization on strategic initiatives and an open forum for Q&A. These live sessions present opportunities for open dialogue on current and relevant topics across the organization.
•Created a communication platform making it easier for key messages to be shared with our manufacturing employees.
•Developed a new hybrid work policy.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
We promote an environment where each employee is valued, respected, and treated with dignity. We believe that diverse voices are essential in creating an organization where every person feels a sense of belonging and we are committed to creating equity and a sense of inclusion for all. This is our mission and commitment. 
Kimball International prohibits unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Our employment practices are non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory, and our policies are designed to safeguard all employees and job applicants from discrimination, harassment and retaliation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), parental status, national origin, age, disability, genetic information including family medical history, political affiliation, military service, or other legally protected status or actions. We are committed to eliminating barriers to success. This includes, but is not limited to, hiring qualified applicants with disabilities, and providing employees with disabilities reasonable accommodations that do not impose an undue hardship.
Talent Development 
We are committed to employee and leadership development. Our flagship senior leadership program provides leadership development through coaching, assessments, and experiential action learning projects with direct mentoring from our CEO. We offer a frontline leadership program for emerging managers and leadership roundtables. We also sponsor employee participation in training programs and have a tuition reimbursement program and support continuing education to maintain professional certifications. 
Compensation, Benefits, and Wellness
The goals of our compensation philosophy are to reward performance, align with shareholders’ interest, and retain key talent. We offer employee participation in a defined contribution 401(k) plan through our Kimball International Retirement Plan. We offer comprehensive benefits to our U.S. full-time employees, including healthcare, pharmacy, a health savings account, an employee assistance program, dental, vision, short-term and long-term disability insurance, life and dependent insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, critical illness insurance, accident, and hospital indemnity insurance. We also partner with a health management company to offer a Company-sponsored health clinic which offers on-site and telehealth appointments for employees and dependents. 
Employee Counts

 | June 30,2021 | June 30,2020
United States | 2,093 | | 2,663
Foreign Countries | 103 | | 145 
Total Employees | 2,196 | | 2,808

Our U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Outside of the U.S., approximately 40 employees are represented by worker’s unions that operate to promote the interests of workers. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Employee Turnover

 | Year Ended
 | June 30 
 | 2021 | | 2020
Voluntary | 27.5 | % | | 26.5 | %
Involuntary | 7.7 | % | | 6.5 | %
Health/Retirement | 6.0 | % | | 3.6 | %
Total Turnover % | 41.2 | % | | 36.6 | %

We monitor voluntary and involuntary turnover independently on a month-to-month basis, taking actions where we see rates exceed our established targets. Our turnover has been impacted by permanent layoffs driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and by a voluntary early retirement option which was offered to select roles. 
Environment and Energy Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no material liabilities related to such items.
We are dedicated to excellence, leadership, and stewardship in matters of protecting the environment and communities in which we have operations. Reinforcing our commitment to the environment, five of our showrooms and one non-manufacturing location were designed under the guidelines of the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for Commercial Interiors program. Our headquarters received the WELL Health-Safety Rating that focuses on operational policies, maintenance protocols, emergency plans and shareholder engagement strategies.
We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, which have been enacted relating to the protection of the environment, will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We believe capital expenditures for environmental control equipment during the current fiscal year and subsequent fiscal years will not represent a material portion of total capital expenditures.
