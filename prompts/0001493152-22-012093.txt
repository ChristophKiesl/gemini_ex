Industry
 
Global Sports Nutrition
 
According to a 2021 analysis by Grand View Research, the global sports nutrition market is expected to experience double digit growth, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 10.9% from 2021 to 2028. A rise in demand is expected to stem from consumers’ increased focus on self-care, preventive medication and fitness. This heightened focus is particularly due to the rapidly growing number of individuals with diabetes and obesity that are at risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Given that our products are designed to enhance one’s health and fitness ability, we expect to benefit and capitalize on these attractive industry tailwinds.
Global Functional Beverages
 
According to a 2021 report by Fior Markets, the functional beverage market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.1% from 2021 to 2028. This growth is expected to stem from an increased demand for ready-to-drink beverages by consumers who seek to maintain their health despite their hectic, busy lifestyles. We believe this growth will be compounded even more by millennials’ strong preference for foods that are convenient and have diverse nutritional profiles. For these reasons, we anticipate that our newly introduced Combat Energy and FitMiss Women’s Complete Energy will experience increased demand, along with our On-The-Go product line.
Our Strengths
 
Consumer Awareness of Our Brands
 
According to Nutritionix.com, our Combat Protein Powder is the fourth best protein brand in the world, and Grand Review Research names MusclePharm as one of the top players in the North American sports nutrition market. For these reasons, we believe consumers have a strong appetite for our brand and products, which is exemplified by our large and engaged social media following. Widespread brand recognition as one of the safest, most trusted and reliable performance lifestyle companies is a strength we seek to maintain, as it allows for organic growth and fosters the adoption of new product innovations.
Strong Intellectual Property
 
We believe that protecting our intellectual property is crucial to the continued successful implementation of our business strategy and marketing our products. Therefore, our policy is to rigorously pursue registrations for all trademarks associated with our products. We have over 39 trademark applications in the United States, 29 of which are currently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Our registered trademarks include registrations of our house marks, as well as marks associated with our core product lines.
 
We also have filed for protection of various marks throughout the world and are committed to a significant long-term strategy to build and protect the MusclePharm and FitMiss brands globally. The “MusclePharm” and “FitMiss” marks have been granted final trademark registration effective in 10 countries, including the United States.
 
Asset Light Business Model
 
Through our asset light model, we achieve low capital expenditures, which we believe is critical to the generation of high free cash flows, gross margin, and lower commodity pricing. Currently, we outsource all manufacturing, testing and bottling to third-parties, and despite challenges in 2020 due to COVID-19, we believe our asset light model will enable us to achieve strong results and profitability in future quarters. For these reasons, we believe our business is uniquely positioned for profitability, without sacrificing the support of our growth initiatives.

Growth Strategy
 
Product Innovation
 
We believe continued innovation in delivery techniques and ingredients, new product lines, and new products in existing lines is important to sustaining and creating new market opportunities, meeting consumer demand, and strengthening customer relationships. Over the last several years, we have launched several new products to meet changing consumer needs and to accelerate our growth. In 2021, we rolled out our functional energy beverages lines under the MusclePharm and FitMiss brands. With continued market expansion of functional beverages, coupled with consumers’ increased focus on ready-to-drink healthy alternatives, we expect our zero sugar and zero calorie energy drinks to benefit from these better-for-you industry tailwinds. Similarly, in 2019, we expanded our On-The-Go assortments with the introduction of gluten free and non-GMO protein products, along with new flavors of our award-winning Combat Crunch Protein Bars. These On-The-Go product assortments target a wide and growing audience, as consumers increasingly demand convenient and ready-to-eat snacks with healthy, diverse nutritional profiles. We continuously monitor market opportunities and consumer trends in order to strategically plan and execute future product innovations. We continue to drive innovation in our already popular protein powder line and in 2021 we launched a new and improved formula, delivering better taste and mixability in our two top selling products, Combat 100% Whey and Combat Protein powder.to To maintain strong demand for our functional energy beverages, we will closely monitor and evaluate customer feedback for future product innovations to sustain our leadership position in the beverage market.
Expand Sales in Current and New Channels
 
We currently distribute our products across all major global retail channels – Specialty, International and FDM. This, paired with our large e-commerce customers, allows us to reach every relevant market in the world. Due to the high competition within these channels, and the ever-changing customer trends, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to expand into new distribution channels, increase product trial, and amplify brand messaging.
 
As we continue to scale our functional energy beverages, we expect to increase our distribution points through Grocery and Convenience channels and expect product trial to increase, providing us with the opportunity to convert trial customers into loyal, repeat purchasers, and ultimately, consumers of our broader product categories. While these initiatives are targeted towards acquiring new, loyal customers, we plan to grow with existing customers through our established, industry-leading distribution partners in the Specialty, International, and FDM. Through increased store penetration and shelf-space, we believe we can grow sales of our functional energy beverages with existing customers by providing widespread accessibility. Given the importance we place on widespread accessibility, we also plan on advancing our e-commerce presence through strategic partnerships, which we believe will not only enhance sales among new and existing customers but also further the global reach of our brand and products.
 
Leverage Existing Brand Awareness for New Products
 
As we continue to execute our growth strategy and focus on core and new product innovations, we plan on leveraging our existing brand awareness to successfully penetrate domestic and international markets. We believe our established brand recognition, recurring customer base, and far reach will further advance the adoption of our products and growth. In the past, our passionate and loyal following has demonstrated a keen appetite for new MusclePharm products and we believe this will continue to play a vital role in the success of future product rollouts.
Sales and Marketing
 
Our goal is to position MusclePharm as the “must have” brand for elite athletes and fitness enthusiasts, alike, who are on a journey to holistically better themselves and achieve their maximum potential. Our marketing is focused on our most prominent products and includes brand partnerships, focusing on grass-roots marketing and advertising efforts with retail outlets close to our core audience. Our marketing includes digital marketing, print and media advertising, in store product demonstrations, promotional giveaways, and trade show events. New product innovation is also a key component of driving incremental sales.

Distribution Channels
 
MusclePharm brands are marketed across major global retail distribution channels – Specialty, International and FDM.
 
Specialty: This channel is composed of brick-and-mortar sales and e-commerce. Due to high competition within this market, we continually seek to respond to customer trends and shifts by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new innovative products and influencing preferences through our marketing.
 
International: Our international reach touches every relevant market in the world. We seek to further grow our international sales by continuing to offer new products in key markets as well as opening new distribution channels in select regions of the world. We also are evaluating the benefits of developing expanded contract manufacturing relationships outside of North America to take advantage of local opportunities.
 
FDM: This channel is primarily served by our direct sales force, as well as our network of brokers. We believe direct relationships with retail partners provide us an opportunity to expand our distribution into additional discount warehouses and national retailers.
 
Below is a table of net revenue by our major distribution channel (in thousands):

Total | $ | 50,042 | | 100 | % | $ | 64,440 | 100 | %

Product Research, Development and Quality Control
 
Customers’ belief in the safety and efficacy of our products is critical. Continued innovation in delivery techniques and ingredients, new product line extensions, and new product offerings are important in order to sustain existing and create new market opportunities, meet consumer demand, and strengthen consumer relationships. To support our research and development efforts, we invest in formulation, processing and packaging development, perform product quality and stability studies, and conduct consumer market research to sample consumer opinions on product concepts, design, packaging, advertising, and marketing campaigns.
 
We are committed to science and sport being equal in our product development. We believe real-world applications are essential. Our product lines have been developed through a stringent protocol to ensure that all formulations promote quality and safety for our customers. Our quality control team follows detailed supplier selection and certification processes, validation of raw material verification processes, analytical testing, process audits, and other quality control procedures. Our products are also subject to extensive shelf-life stability testing. We also engage third-party laboratories to routinely evaluate and validate our internal testing processes on every MusclePharm product.
 
We qualify ingredients, suppliers, and facilities by performing site assessments and conducting on-going performance and process reviews. Dedicated quality teams regularly audit and assess manufacturing facilities for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”), as regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), to ensure our compliance with all MusclePharm, regulatory, and certification standards and requirements. To ensure overall consistency, our quality assurance team adheres to strict written procedures. From the raw ingredient stage to the finished product stage, we monitor and perform quality control checks. Before distributing our products, we place our products under quarantine to test for environmental contaminants and verify that the finished product meets label claims. Once a product has successfully passed quality assurance testing and conforms to specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, we then conduct testing with third-party laboratories for added label claim verification.
 
Multi-level practices are part of our product development process to ensure athletes and our consumers receive what we believe to be the most scientifically innovative and safest products on the market. Post-distribution, we have standard operating procedures in place for investigating and documenting any adverse events or product quality complaints. We are committed to the process of having all of our products certified to be banned-substance-free before they are available to consumers. Informed Choice, a globally recognized leader in sports testing, conducts all of our third-party banned substance testing, ensuring that all MusclePharm products are free of banned substances.

Manufacturing and Distribution
 
We have relationships with multiple third-party manufacturers. Certain of our vendors supply in excess of 10% of our products.  Once a product is manufactured, it is shipped directly to the customer or through a third-party distribution center. All of the third-party manufacturing facilities and distribution facilities we utilize are designed and operated to meet current GMP standards as promulgated by the FDA.
 
The manufacturing process performed by our third-party manufacturers generally consists of the following operations: (I) qualifying ingredients for products; (ii) testing of all raw ingredients; (iii) measuring ingredients for inclusion in production; (iv) granulating, blending and grinding ingredients into a mixture with a homogeneous consistency; (v) encapsulating or filling the blended mixture into the appropriate dosage form using either automatic or semiautomatic equipment; and (vi) testing finished products prior to distribution.
 
We maintain and operate a system that integrates distribution, warehousing, and quality control. This provides real-time lot and quality tracking of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods. We employ a supply chain staff that works with sales, marketing, product development, and quality control personnel  to ensure that only products that meet all specifications are produced and released to customers.
 
Our Competitors
 
The sports nutrition market is very competitive, and the range of products is diverse and subject to rapid and frequent changes in consumer demand. Competitors use price, shelf space and store placement, as well as brand and product recognition, new product introductions, and raw materials to capture market share. We believe that retailers look to partner with suppliers who demonstrate brand development, market intelligence, customer service, and produce high quality products with proven science. We believe we are competitive in all these areas.
 
Our competitors include numerous nutritional companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels, and product categories. In addition, we compete with large pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies. Many of these competitors have greater financial and distribution resources available to them than us and some compete through vertical integration. In addition, private label entities have gained a foothold in many nutrition categories and also are direct competitors. Our principal competitors are: Glanbia Performance Nutrition (Optimum Nutrition), Nutrabolt, (Cellucor C4), Dymatize Enterprises LLC, Celsius and Iovate Health Sciences International Inc. As many of our competitors are either privately held or divisions within larger organizations, it is difficult to fully gauge their size and relative ranking.
 
Government Regulation
 
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution, storage, and sale of each of our product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies. The most active of these is the FDA, which regulates our products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the regulations promulgated thereunder. FDA regulations relating specifically to foods and dietary supplements for human use are set forth in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
Dietary Supplement Regulation
 
The FDA has primary jurisdiction for the regulation of dietary supplements. The FDA regulates dietary supplements under the FDCA as a separate regulatory category of “foods.” The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, including by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the “NLEA”) and the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. A “dietary supplement” is defined under the FDCA as “a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals; a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of the ingredients listed above.” Dietary supplements are intended to enhance the diet, and may not be represented as a conventional food or as the sole item of a meal or diet.

- 10 -
------


Dietary supplements do not require approval from the FDA before they are marketed. Except in the case of a “new dietary ingredient,” where pre-market review for safety data and other information is required by law, a company is not required to provide the FDA with the evidence it relies on to substantiate safety or effectiveness before marketing a supplement product. A manufacturer or distributor must notify the FDA if it intends to market a dietary supplement in the U.S. that contains a “new dietary ingredient.” A new dietary ingredient is an ingredient marketed after October 15, 1994. The manufacturer must demonstrate to the FDA that the new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for use in a dietary supplement. There is no authoritative list of dietary ingredients that were marketed before October 15, 1994. Therefore, manufacturers are responsible for determining if a dietary ingredient is “new.”
 
Manufacturers of dietary supplements must register with the FDA pursuant to the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (“Bioterrorism Act”) before producing supplements. Manufacturers of dietary supplements also must follow current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations for the preparation, packaging and storage of our food and dietary supplements. Entities that manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplement products must follow applicable cGMP regulations. These regulations focus on practices that ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength and composition of dietary supplements. We engage with third-party manufacturers to manufacture our dietary supplements.
 
Our business practices and products are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency. The USDA governs certain product labeling, such as organic and non-GMO claims. The FTC has the primary responsibility of regulating the advertising of foods, including dietary supplements. Under the FTC Act, all advertising claims, both express and implied, must be truthful, non-misleading, and substantiated. In practice, the FDA and FTC share jurisdiction over promotional practices and monitor the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements in multiple media forms, including TV, radio, social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), and the internet. We are responsible for determining that the dietary supplements we manufacture or distribute are safe, and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that the claims are not false or misleading.
 
Our activities, including our direct selling distribution activities, are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are sold. In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and initiating or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work extensively with local consultants and authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals.
 
We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently. In the U.S., foods and dietary supplements are subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act (“NLEA”), which governs health claims, ingredient labeling, and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in a product. Dietary supplements may be intended to affect the structure or function of the human body. If the label of a dietary supplement contains such structure/function claims, the label must bear the disclaimer: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”
 
All serious adverse events occurring within the United States involving dietary supplements must be reported to the FDA. FDA laws also govern the recalls of foods and dietary supplements.
 
We may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from a foreign country’s ministry of health or comparable agency prior to commencing operations and initiating or permitting sales of our regulated products in foreign markets. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work with local consultants and authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. We also must comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that protecting our intellectual property is crucial to the continued successful implementation of our business strategy. Since we regard our intellectual property as a crucial element of our business with significant value in the marketing of our products, our policy is to rigorously pursue registrations for all trademarks associated with our products.
 
We have over 39 trademark applications in the United States, 29 of which are currently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Our registered trademarks include registrations of our house marks , as well as marks associated with our core product lines.
 
We also have filed for protection of various marks throughout the world and are committed to a significant long-term strategy to build and protect the MusclePharm brand globally. The “MusclePharm” and “FitMiss” marks have been granted final trademark registration effective in 10 countries, including the United States.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business does not typically experience seasonal variations, but revenue may fluctuate based upon promotions.
