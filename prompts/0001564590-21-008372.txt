Company Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that address unmet medical needs in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP), and is the first and only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist/antagonist, preferentially targeting 5-HT2A receptors with no appreciable affinity for dopaminergic, histaminergic, or muscarinic receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP without negatively impacting motor function in our Phase 3 pivotal trial. NUPLAZID has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA for the treatment of PDP. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin.

We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PDP and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states. Beyond PDP, we believe dementia-related psychosis (DRP), represents one of our most important opportunities for further development.  In June 2020, we submitted to the FDA a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for NUPLAZID for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with DRP. In July 2020 the FDA notified us of their filing of our sNDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of April 3, 2021. 
 Negative symptoms of schizophrenia have been associated with poor long-term outcomes and disability even when the positive symptoms are well controlled, representing a high unmet need. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. We are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. In the fourth quarter of 2019 we announced positive results from our pivotal ADVANCE study and in the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a second pivotal study, ADVANCE-2. The Phase 3 program is evaluating the efficacy of pimavanserin in patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia who have achieved adequate control of positive symptoms with their existing antipsychotic treatment.
 In August 2018, we acquired an exclusive North American license to develop and commercialize trofinetide for Rett syndrome and other indications from Neuren Pharmaceuticals Limited (Neuren). Rett syndrome is a debilitating neurological disorder that occurs predominantly in females following apparently normal development for the first six months of life. Typically, between six to eighteen months of age, patients experience a period of rapid decline with loss of purposeful hand use and spoken communication and inability to independently conduct activities of daily living. Symptoms also include seizures, disorganized breathing patterns, scoliosis and sleep disturbances. Currently, there are no approved medicines for the treatment of Rett syndrome. In October 2019, we initiated the Phase 3 LAVENDER study evaluating trofinetide in Rett syndrome. Based on current enrollment projections, we expect results from our LAVENDER study in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 In August 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with CerSci Therapeutics Incorporated (CerSci), pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries merged with and into CerSci, with CerSci as the surviving corporation. CerSci’s lead product candidate, ACP-044, is a novel, first-in-class, orally administered, peripherally-restricted, non-opioid analgesic being evaluated for the treatment of pain. The mechanism of action is designed to interrupt multiple pain pathways and sensitization of neurons to pain, by accelerating the decomposition of peroxynitrite, a nitroxidative agent elevated following tissue injury. The CerSci portfolio contains a portfolio of preclinical stage molecules, including brain penetrant compounds, with potential for symptomatic and disease modifying utility in neurodegenerative diseases. ACP-044 has shown promising results in animal models evaluating incisional, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain, as well as favorable tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in Phase 1 trials. In the first quarter of 2021, we will be initiating an acute pain Phase 2 study of ACP-044 compared to placebo for patients undergoing bunionectomy surgery. In addition, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study for patients suffering from chronic osteoarthritis pain in the second quarter of 2021.
 In March 2020, we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize novel drug candidates targeting positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the muscarinic M1 receptor with the potential to treat cognition in dementia and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia, from Vanderbilt University. Under the agreement, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to certain highly selective M1 PAMs, which represent a promising approach for improving cognitive function and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients suffering from CNS disorders. The agreement includes a portfolio of candidates, with molecules at various stages of testing, including the lead compound, ACP-319, which is in Phase 1 testing, and several additional compounds in pre-clinical development as well as any additional compounds generated in an ongoing discovery program.

 Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to identify, develop and commercialize innovative therapies that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. Key elements of our strategy are to:
  
• | Drive the successful commercialization of NUPLAZID for Parkinson’s disease psychosis in the United States. NUPLAZID was approved by the FDA in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. We launched NUPLAZID in the United States in May 2016 and an important objective is to establish NUPLAZID as the standard of care for PDP. We employ U.S. sales specialists that are focused on promoting NUPLAZID to physicians who treat PDP patients, including neurologists, psychiatrists and long-term care physicians.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deliver pimavanserin to the market for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. In June 2020, we submitted an sNDA for NUPLAZID for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with DRP. Our PDUFA target action date is April 3, 2021. In preparation for a potential U.S. launch, we plan to increase the U.S. sales force, including expansion of additional commercial, medical affairs and general and administrative support functions prior to obtaining regulatory approval for NUPLAZID in DRP. If approved, NUPLAZID will be the first and only FDA-approved treatment for DRP.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop our next wave of breakthroughs. We are advancing clinical candidates in five indications focused on the treatment of neurological and psychiatric indications that are underserved due to limited or no treatment options and represent large unmet medical needs. We have ongoing research programs and are focused on licensing and acquiring new programs through strategic business development.

NUPLAZID (pimavanserin)
 Pimavanserin is a new chemical entity that we discovered and that was approved by the FDA in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition and is marketed under the tradename NUPLAZID in the United States. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist/antagonist preferentially targeting the 5-HT2A receptor, a key serotonin receptor that plays an important role in psychosis. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP without negatively impacting motor function in our Phase 3 pivotal trial. NUPLAZID has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PDP. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to NUPLAZID for all indications and have established a broad patent portfolio, which includes numerous issued patents in the United States, Europe, and several additional countries. NUPLAZID is available in 34 mg capsule and 10 mg tablet dosage forms.
 NUPLAZID as a Treatment for Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis
 Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. According to the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation, about one million people in the United States and more than 10 million people globally suffer from this disease. Approximately 50% of Parkinson’s patients will experience psychosis over the course of their disease. Parkinson’s disease is more common in people over 60 years of age and the prevalence of this disease is expected to increase significantly as the population ages.
 PDP is a debilitating disorder commonly characterized by visual hallucinations and delusions that afflicts about 40% of the one million Parkinson’s disease patients in the United States. The development of psychosis in patients with Parkinson’s disease substantially contributes to the burden of Parkinson’s disease and deeply affects their quality of life. PDP is associated with a diminished quality of life, nursing home placement, and increased caregiver stress and burden.
 As the first and only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP, NUPLAZID provides an innovative approach to the treatment of PDP without compromising motor control and potentially avoiding many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics.
 In connection with the FDA approval of NUPLAZID, we have agreed to four post-marketing commitments. Two of four commitments are already completed within the agreed upon timelines. The remaining two commitments, including a randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal study in PDP patients treated with NUPLAZID and a randomized, placebo-controlled eight-week study or studies in predominantly frail and elderly patients that would add to the NUPLAZID safety database by exposing an aggregate of at least 500 patients to NUPLAZID, are on-track to be completed according to timelines agreed to with the FDA. 
 Pimavanserin as a Treatment for Dementia-Related Psychosis
 An estimated 8.0 million people in the United States are living with dementia and studies suggest that approximately 30% of dementia patients, or 2.4 million people, have psychosis, commonly consisting of delusions and hallucinations. Approximately 1.2 million patients in the United States are currently treated for DRP and of those treated, approximately two-thirds are treated with off-label anti-psychotics.
Symptoms of DRP are often persistent and may occur with increasing frequency with progression of disease as patients become more impaired. Serious consequences have been associated with persistent or severe psychosis in persons with dementia such as repeated hospital admissions, earlier progression to nursing home care, severe dementia, and death. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for DRP. Off-label use of typical and atypical antipsychotics is associated with modest and often equivocal efficacy in these patients. In addition, use of currently available antipsychotics is associated with a significant acceleration in cognitive decline in patients with dementia as well as numerous off-target toxicities, thus negatively impacting the primary illness. The cognitive effects of treatment with an atypical antipsychotic were evaluated in the National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness–Alzheimer’s Disease (CATIE-AD) study. In this study, patients on any atypical antipsychotic had significantly greater rates of decline in cognitive function compared to patients on placebo. This pronounced negative impact of currently used antipsychotics on cognitive function is believed to be associated with the common pharmacologic property of these drugs, namely blocking of dopamine receptors. Atypical antipsychotics are associated with a number of off-target and dose-limiting side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, hematologic abnormalities, and metabolic, gastrointestinal and sedative effects. These off-target toxicities are associated with increased risk for falls, infection, aspiration pneumonia, and other 
 4


serious complications in this vulnerable patient population. With no approved therapies for the treatment of patients with DRP and current off-label use of atypical antipsychotics carrying significant morbidity risks including worsening in cognitive decline and other off target toxicities, we believe that DRP represents an area of high unmet need.
 In September 2017, we initiated HARMONY, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled relapse prevention study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with DRP. The objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of pimavanserin to prevent relapse of psychosis in a broad population of patients with the most common subtypes of dementia. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for the treatment of DRP. 
 The HARMONY study included a 12-week open-label stabilization period during which 392 patients with DRP were treated with pimavanserin 34 mg once daily. Dose reduction to 20 mg once daily was allowed based on tolerability within the first four weeks. Following the 12-week open-label period, patients who met pre-specified criteria for treatment response at both weeks 8 and weeks 12 were then randomized into the double-blind period of the study to continue their pimavanserin dose (34 mg or 20 mg per day) or switched to placebo and followed for up to 26 weeks or until a relapse of psychosis occurred. The primary endpoint in the study was time to relapse in the double-blind period as represented by the Kaplan-Meier curve and the hazard ratio. 
 In September 2019, we announced that our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention trial evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of DRP would be stopped early for positive efficacy as it met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a highly statistically significant longer time to relapse of psychosis with pimavanserin compared to placebo in a planned interim efficacy analysis. In December 2019, we announced top-line results from the HARMONY study in a presentation at the 12th CTAD Meeting. Pimavanserin met the primary endpoint of the study by significantly reducing the risk of relapse of psychosis by 2.8 fold compared to placebo (HR = 0.353; one-sided p=0.0023). In addition, pimavanserin met the key secondary endpoint by significantly reducing risk of discontinuation for any reason by 2.2 fold (HR = 0.452; one-sided p=0.0024). In the 12-week open-label treatment period, 61.8% of eligible patients met pre-specified criteria for pimavanserin treatment response at both week 8 and week 12 and were subsequently randomized into the double-blind period of the study. In an exploratory analysis in the open label-phase, the mean percent reduction from baseline on the SAPS+HD was 46.9%, 63.0% and 75.2%, at Weeks 4, 8 and enriched Week 12 population, respectively.
 Pimavanserin was well-tolerated over the entire nine-month study duration. Patients receiving pimavanserin treatment had no worsening in cognition, as measured by the MMSE score, from baseline and no worsening of motor symptoms, as measured by the ESRS-A, from baseline. In the double-blind period, adverse events were observed in 41.0% of patients on pimavanserin and 36.6% of patients on placebo. Discontinuations due to adverse events were 2.9% for pimavanserin and 3.6% for placebo. Serious adverse events were 4.8% in the pimavanserin group and 3.6% in the placebo group. One death was reported in the open-label period and one death was reported in the pimavanserin group during the double-blind period. Investigators determined neither death was related to the study drug. Additionally, pimavanserin did not result in clinically significant differences in vital signs, weight, or daytime sedation compared to placebo. 
 In July 2020 the FDA notified us of their filing of our sNDA with a PDUFA target action date of April 3, 2021. The sNDA is supported by results from the pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY study. The sNDA also includes positive efficacy results from two additional placebo-controlled studies, both of which met their respective primary endpoints: the Phase 2 (-019) study in patients with Alzheimer’s disease psychosis and the Phase 3 (-020) study in patients with PDP. The sNDA includes a large safety database from completed and ongoing studies representing over 1,500 patients with neurodegenerative disease. 
 Pimavanserin as a Treatment for the Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia
 Schizophrenia is a severe chronic mental illness that involves disturbances in cognition, perception, emotion, and other aspects of behavior. These disturbances may include positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, and a range of negative symptoms, including loss of interest and emotional withdrawal. Schizophrenia is associated with persistent impairment of a patient’s social functioning and productivity. Cognitive disturbances often prevent patients with schizophrenia from readjusting to society. As a result, patients with schizophrenia are normally required to be under medical care for their entire lives. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 1% of the U.S. population suffers from schizophrenia. 
 Most patients with schizophrenia in the United States today are treated with second-generation, or atypical, antipsychotics, which induce fewer motor disturbances than typical, or first-generation, antipsychotics, but still fail to fully address some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia for a significant portion of patients. In addition, currently prescribed 
 5


treatments have either negligible effects on cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia or may even further impair cognitive performance. It is believed that the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics is due to their interactions with dopamine and 5-HT2A receptors. Despite their commercial success, current antipsychotic drugs have substantial limitations, including inadequate efficacy and severe side effects. The side effects associated with these atypical agents may include weight gain, type 2  diabetes, metabolic, sexual and cardiovascular side effects, movement disturbances or sedation. 
 In November 2016, we announced that we initiated ADVANCE, a Phase 2 study to evaluate pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Studies show that about 40% to 50% of schizophrenia patients suffer from prominent negative symptoms. While currently available antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenia mainly target positive symptoms, many patients remain functionally impaired because of residual negative and cognitive symptoms that are harder to treat with atypical antipsychotics. The residual negative and cognitive symptoms limit social functioning. There is currently no drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 
 ADVANCE was a Phase 2, 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, international study designed to examine the efficacy and safety of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia who have predominant negative symptoms while on a stable background antipsychotic therapy. 403 patients were randomized to receive once-daily pimavanserin (n=201) or placebo (n=202) as an adjunct treatment to their ongoing antipsychotic in a flexible dosing regimen. The starting daily dose of 20 mg of pimavanserin at baseline could have been adjusted to 34 mg or 10 mg during the first eight weeks of treatment. 53.8% of patients who were randomized to receive pimavanserin completed the trial on 34 mg, 44.7% on 20 mg, and 1.5% on 10 mg. The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline to week 26 on the NSA-16 total score. In November 2019, we announced positive top-line results from the ADVANCE study. In this study, pimavanserin demonstrated a statistically significant improvement on the study’s primary endpoint, the change from baseline to week 26 on the Negative Symptom Assessment-16 (NSA-16) total score, compared to placebo (p=0.043). A greater improvement in the NSA-16 total score compared to placebo was observed in patients who received the highest pimavanserin dose of 34 mg (n=107; unadjusted p=0.0065). Pimavanserin did not separate from placebo on the key secondary endpoint, the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. In the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a second pivotal study, ADVANCE-2. The Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy of pimavanserin 34 mg once daily compared to placebo in approximately 386 patients with predominantly negative symptoms of schizophrenia who have achieved adequate control of positive symptoms with their existing antipsychotic treatment.
 Pimavanserin as an Adjunctive Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder
 In October 2018, we announced positive top-line results from CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor / serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI) drugs in 207 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In July 2020, we announced that our Phase 3 CLARITY study, which combined the two identical, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (CLARITY-2 and CLARITY-3) in 298 patients, did not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint. At this time we do not plan on initiating any additional Phase 3 studies to evaluate pimavanserin for adjunctive use with SSRI/SNRI drugs for the treatment of MDD.
 Trofinetide
Trofinetide is a novel synthetic analog of the amino‐terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) designed to treat the core symptoms of Rett syndrome by reducing neuroinflammation and supporting synaptic function. Trofinetide has been granted FDA Fast Track Status and Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and Orphan Designation in Europe.
 Trofinetide as a Treatment for Rett Syndrome
 Rett syndrome is a debilitating neurological disorder that occurs primarily in females following apparently normal development for the first six months of life. Rett syndrome has been most often misdiagnosed as autism, cerebral palsy, or non-specific developmental delay. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations on the X chromosome on a gene called MECP2. There are more than 200 different mutations found on the MECP2 gene that interfere with its ability to generate a normal gene product. Rett syndrome occurs worldwide in approximately one of every 10,000 to 15,000 female births causing problems in brain function that are responsible for cognitive, sensory, emotional, motor and autonomic function. Typically, between six to eighteen months of age, patients experience a period of rapid decline with loss of purposeful hand use and spoken communication and inability to independently conduct activities of daily living. Symptoms also include seizures, disorganized breathing patterns, an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis) and sleep disturbances. Currently, there are no approved medicines approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome. In October 2019, we initiated the Phase 3 
 6


LAVENDER study, a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluating trofinetide in approximately 180 girls and young women 5 to 20 years of age with Rett syndrome. Half of study participants will receive trofinetide and half will receive placebo. Co-primary efficacy endpoints of the study will measure symptom improvement using the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ), a caregiver assessment, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I), a clinician assessment. Based on current enrollment projections, we expect results from our LAVENDER study in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 ACP-044
 ACP-044, is a novel, first-in-class, orally administered, non-opioid analgesic being evaluated for the treatment of pain. The mechanism of action is designed to interrupt multiple pain pathways and sensitization of neurons to pain, by accelerating the decomposition of peroxynitrite, a nitroxidative agent elevated following tissue injury. There is a significant high unmet need for more effective, safe, non-opioid and non-addictive treatments for pain management. ACP-044 has shown promising results in animal models evaluating incisional, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain, as well as favorable tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties in Phase 1 trials. In the first quarter of 2021, we will be initiating an acute pain Phase 2 study ACP-044 compared to placebo for patients undergoing bunionectomy surgery. In addition, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study for patients suffering from chronic osteoarthritis pain in the second quarter of 2021.
 ACP-319
 ACP-319 is a positive allosteric modulator of the muscarinic receptor targeting M1 (M1 PAM). The challenge with targeting the muscarinic system has been issues related to tolerability. Targeting of these receptors has been associated with cholinergic side effects. However, the allosteric modulation of the M1 receptor may achieve the potential therapeutic benefits without the unwanted side effects. Animal studies have demonstrated improvement in models of both cognition and schizophrenia without the cholinergic side effects. Given the high unmet need, ACP-319 is being developed for potential utility in cognition in dementia and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. 
 Competition
 We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target.
 For example, the use of NUPLAZID for the treatment of PDP competes with off-label use of various antipsychotic drugs, including the generic drugs quetiapine, clozapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine.
 If approved, pimavanserin for the treatment of DRP would also compete with off-label use of various antipsychotic drugs, including the generic drugs quetiapine, clozapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine, as well as generic mood stabilizers such as valproate. Other generic agents for the treatment of underlying dementia such as donepezil and memantine may also be secondarily used for the treatment of DRP, although NUPLAZID would not be promoted to replace these agents.
 Pimavanserin for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, if approved for that indication, would compete with off-label use of Vraylar, marketed by Allergan, Rexulti, marketed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Latuda, marketed by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Caplyta, marketed by IntraCellular Therapeutics and various generic drugs, including quetiapine, clozapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine.
 Trofinetide, if approved would compete indirectly with off-label usage of branded and generic prescription medications targeted at individual symptoms of Rett syndrome, including antiepileptics, antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Several academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies are currently conducting clinical trials for the treatment of various symptoms of Rett syndrome. 
 Other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell for the applicable disorder. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small 
 7


molecule drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:
  
• | preclinical studies and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | commercializing pharmaceutical products.
--+-----------------------------------------

 In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas:
  
• | capital resources;
--+-------------------


• | research and development resources;
--+------------------------------------


• | manufacturing capabilities;
--+----------------------------


• | sales and marketing; and
--+-------------------------


• | production facilities.
--+-----------------------

 Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may develop superior technologies or methods to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule drugs. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific, sales and marketing, and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable, or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Intellectual Property
 We currently hold 36 issued U.S. patents and a significant number of related issued foreign patents. We have also exclusively licensed rights to an additional 24 issued U.S. patents, and a number of related foreign patents. Patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights are an essential element of our business. Our strategy is to file patent applications in the United States and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to us. In addition, we seek to protect our technology and inventions (and improvements to inventions) that are important to the development of our business. Our patent applications claim proprietary technology, including chemical synthetic or manufacturing methods, drug assays, novel compounds, compositions, formulations and methods of treatment. We also rely upon trade secrets, including technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets, to identify and develop novel drugs, as well as manufacturing or clinical development technologies, among others. We protect our trade secrets by, among other things, requiring employees and third parties who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements. We are a party to various license agreements that give us rights to use certain technologies in our research and development.
Pimavanserin
 To date, 33 U.S. patents have been issued to us that relate to pimavanserin, NUPLAZID and methods of use. Sixteen of these are Orange Book-listed patents that relate to pimavanserin, NUPLAZID and our approved indication, and cover the general formula of the compound, the composition of matter, with claims specifically directed to pimavanserin and salts thereof, the specific polymorph form of pimavanserin, the approved formulations, and the use thereof for treating our approved indication. The composition of matter patent covering pimavanserin and salts thereof currently has an expiration date in 2027, which could be extended to April 2030 with the addition of the patent term extension (PTE) application we have filed and elected to apply to this patent. This PTE application is currently being reviewed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The patents covering the polymorph form and the use of pimavanserin or NUPLAZID for our approved indication are currently set to expire between 2022 and 2028. These patent terms include adjustments made by the PTO, but not extensions. 
 8


In the United States, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as “Hatch-Waxman,” we are permitted to extend the term of one U.S. patent for pimavanserin or the use thereof. Patent terms may be subject to change not only due to potential patent term extensions but also to any terminal disclaimer that reduces patent term, as well as other factors. Because the U.S. patent laws and judicial interpretations thereof change, modifications or new interpretations of the laws may impact our patent terms.
 The remaining 17 U.S. patents relating to pimavanserin that have been issued to us cover methods of use of pimavanserin for, among other things, treating AD Psychosis, Alzheimer’s disease indications, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Lewy body dementia, sleep disorders, hallucinations and delusions, and methods of producing pimavanserin. We also have a significant number of related issued foreign patents that specifically cover pimavanserin and polymorphs thereof in Europe and Asia as well as in Australia, Canada, Mexico and other countries. 
 We continue to file and prosecute patent applications directed to pimavanserin, formulations of pimavanserin, methods of manufacturing, and to methods of treating various diseases using pimavanserin, either alone or in combination with other agents, worldwide. For example, in late 2019 and in 2020, we obtained and listed in the Orange Book four additional U.S. issued patents, one patent directed to a method of use for our 10 mg tablet, expiring in 2037, and three patents directed to our 34 mg capsule formulation, each expiring in 2038.
 We entered into a license agreement in 2006 for certain intellectual property rights from the Ipsen Group that complement the intellectual property portfolio for our serotonin platform, including pimavanserin. We are required to pay to the Ipsen Group royalties of up to 2% of net product sales of NUPLAZID pursuant to the agreement. This obligation terminates in 2021.

 Our business activities, including the manufacturing and marketing of NUPLAZID and our potential products and our ongoing research and development activities, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any new drug developed by us must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, import, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Moreover, government coverage and reimbursement policies will both directly and indirectly impact our ability to successfully commercialize NUPLAZID and any future approved products, and such coverage and reimbursement policies will be impacted by enacted and any applicable future healthcare reform and drug pricing measures. In addition, we are subject to state and federal laws, including, among others, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and transparency laws that restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry.
 In the United States, drug product candidates intended for human use undergo laboratory and animal testing until adequate proof of safety is established. Clinical trials for new product candidates are then typically conducted in humans in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 trials involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. The emphasis of Phase 1 trials is on testing for safety or adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the compound for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a compound shows initial evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes. Before commencing clinical investigations in humans, we or our collaborators must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), to the FDA.
 Regulatory authorities, Institutional Review Boards and Data Monitoring Committees may require additional data before allowing the clinical studies to commence, continue or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that the studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues. Clinical testing must also meet requirements for clinical trial registration, institutional review board oversight, informed consent, health information privacy, and good clinical practices (GCPs). Additionally, the manufacture of our drug product must be done in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (GMPs).

To establish a new product candidate’s safety and efficacy, the FDA requires companies seeking approval to market a drug product to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data, along with other information, for each indication for which the product will be labeled. The data and information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA), which must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies. Generating the required data and information for an NDA takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a product candidate under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate. Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA submitted for FDA approval is given an internal administrative review within 60 days following submission of the NDA. If deemed sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA will “file” the NDA. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal goals of eight months from submission for priority review of NDAs that cover new product candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and 12 months from submission for the standard review of NDAs. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, these performance goals may change over time and the review is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the NDA can be approved. Before approving an NDA, the FDA can choose to inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with GMPs. The FDA may also audit sites at which clinical trials have been conducted to determine compliance with GCPs and data integrity. The FDA’s review of an NDA may also involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee, particularly for novel indications. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.
 In addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy, regulations or statutes governing product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review.
 Before receiving FDA approval to market a potential product, we or our collaborators must demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical studies that the potential product is safe and effective in the patient population that will be treated. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data or a plan to collect such data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless a waiver applies. If regulatory approval of a potential product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is approved. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is generally prohibited. Furthermore, FDA approval may entail ongoing requirements for risk management, including post-marketing, or Phase 4, studies. Even if approval is obtained, each marketed product, is subject to payment of a significant annual program user fee and continuing review and periodic inspections by the FDA. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer, including labeling changes, warning letters, costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Any drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product candidate, known as toxicological studies, or during clinical trials of our potential products. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates. Further, such unacceptable toxicity or side effects could ultimately prevent a potential product’s approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications or limit any labeling claims and market acceptance, even if the product is approved.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.

We and our collaborators and contract manufacturers also are required to comply with the applicable FDA GMP regulations. GMP regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the FDA. These facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our potential products and must maintain ongoing compliance for commercial product manufacture. The FDA may conclude that we or our collaborators or contract manufacturers are not in compliance with applicable GMP requirements and other FDA regulatory requirements, which may result in delay or failure to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls and/or imposition of fines or penalties.
 If a product is approved, we must also comply with post-marketing requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with advertising and promotion laws enforced by various government agencies, including the FDA’s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion, through such laws as the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, healthcare information privacy and security laws, post-marketing safety surveillance, and disclosure of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities. In addition, we are subject to other federal and state regulation including, for example, the implementation of corporate compliance programs.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.
 Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, marketing authorization will be granted. This foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA marketing approval discussed above. In addition, foreign regulations may include applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and entities.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of NUPLAZID and of our product candidates, if approved, depend and will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party payor reimbursement or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover NUPLAZID or any future approved products could reduce physician usage of our products, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 In the United States, the Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary outpatient drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries for certain products. NUPLAZID is available for coverage under Medicare Part D, but the individual Part D plans offer coverage subject to various factors such as those described above. In addition, while Medicare Part D plans have historically included “all or substantially all” drugs in the following designated classes of “clinical concern” on their formularies: anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antineoplastics, antipsychotics, antiretrovirals, and immunosuppressants, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has in the past proposed, but not adopted, changes to this policy. If this policy is changed in the future and if CMS no longer considers the antipsychotic class to be of “clinical concern”, Medicare Part D plans would have significantly more discretion to reduce the number of products covered in that class, including 
 11


coverage of NUPLAZID. Furthermore, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policies.
 Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their implementing regulations, imposes obligations on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, the European Union (EU), has established its own data security and privacy legal framework, including but not limited to the recently adopted European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/79 (GDPR), which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions than previous EU data protection laws and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. We currently conduct clinical trials in the EU and will need to be compliant with these requirements. We anticipate that over time we may expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (as defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors by such law) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drugs, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.
 12


If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other federal or state regulations, we may be subject to significant administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from federal health care programs, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
 Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to NUPLAZID and our product candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. Legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act), includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminates, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans. On December 14, 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the 2017 Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining 
 13


access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA. Through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers. 
 Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products. There have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, both Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the then-current presidential administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the Department of HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of this rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. In addition, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for NUPLAZID and any future approved products. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future.

Manufacturing and Distribution
 We currently outsource, and plan to continue to outsource, manufacturing activities for NUPLAZID, as well as for our existing and future product candidates for development and commercial purposes. We believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to our commercial activities and to the ongoing development of pimavanserin without devoting the substantial resources and capital required to build manufacturing facilities.
 In each of 2015 and 2020, we licensed worldwide intellectual property rights related to pimavanserin in certain indications to Acadia Pharmaceuticals GmbH, our wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary (Acadia GmbH). Our active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), has been manufactured in Switzerland for over 10 years and we anticipate continuing to manufacture in Switzerland. Acadia GmbH manages the worldwide supply chain of pimavanserin API.
 Acadia GmbH has contracted with Siegfried AG, to manufacture the API to be used in NUPLAZID for commercial sale. Under the manufacturing agreement, Acadia GmbH has agreed to purchase from Siegfried specified percentages of our commercial requirements of API for the United States and Europe. The parties may also agree in the future on additional services under the manufacturing agreement with respect to non-commercial supply or development activities. The term of the manufacturing agreement ends in December 2021 and will automatically renew for subsequent two-year terms unless either party provides timely notice of its intent not to renew, or unless the manufacturing agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. Either party may terminate the manufacturing agreement prior to expiration upon an uncured material breach by the other party, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the other party, the commencement of insolvency procedures that are not dismissed within a certain period of time, the appointment of any receiver, trustee or assignee to take possession of the properties of the other party or the cessation of all or substantially all of the other party's business operations, upon certain continuing patent infringement, regulatory litigation or other legal proceedings involving the manufacture of API, upon a continuing force majeure affecting the other party, or if no services are currently being provided under the manufacturing agreement. Additionally, if the parties agree on development services under the manufacturing agreement, the parties may terminate such services by mutual agreement if reasonable efforts to achieve the goals of such services fail. Acadia GmbH also may terminate any services under the manufacturing agreement for any reason on 90 days’ prior notice to Siegfried, subject to the requirements of the manufacturing agreement.
 We have contracted with Patheon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Patheon), to manufacture NUPLAZID 10 mg tablet and 34 mg capsule drug product for commercial use in the United States. We have also contracted with a second contract manufacturing organization to manufacture NUPLAZID 34 mg drug product for commercial use in the United States. Under the manufacturing agreement with Patheon, we have agreed to purchase from Patheon a specified percentage of our commercial requirements of NUPLAZID for the United States. Under the agreement, Patheon will also perform specified validation services. The term of the manufacturing agreement ends in the first quarter of 2023 and will automatically renew for subsequent two-year terms unless either party provides timely notice of its intent not to renew, or unless the manufacturing agreement is terminated early pursuant to its terms. Each party may terminate the manufacturing agreement prior to expiration upon the uncured material breach by the other party, upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party or in the event of a continuing force majeure event affecting the other party. The manufacturing agreement will also terminate if we provide notice to Patheon that we no longer require manufacturing services because NUPLAZID has been discontinued. Additionally, we may terminate the manufacturing agreement, subject to certain limitations, if any regulatory authority takes any action or raises any objection that prevents us from continuing to commercialize NUPLAZID or takes an enforcement action against Patheon’s manufacturing site that relates to NUPLAZID or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect Patheon’s ability to supply NUPLAZID, if we determine to discontinue commercialization of NUPLAZID for safety or efficacy reasons, or if Patheon uses any debarred person in performing its service obligations under the manufacturing agreement. We also may terminate the manufacturing agreement for any other reason on three years’ prior notice to Patheon. Patheon may terminate the manufacturing agreement if we assign the manufacturing agreement or any of our rights under the manufacturing agreement to a Patheon competitor.
 We sell NUPLAZID to a limited number of specialty pharmacies (SPs), and specialty distributors (SDs), which we collectively refer to as our customers. SPs subsequently dispense NUPLAZID to patients based on the fulfillment of a prescription and SDs subsequently sell NUPLAZID to government facilities, long-term care pharmacies, and in-patient hospital pharmacies. Four customers, each based in the United States, accounted for approximately 74% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have retained third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the distribution of NUPLAZID, including warehousing, customer service, order-taking, invoicing, collections, and shipment and returns processing.

Sales and Marketing
 We have U.S. sales specialists that are focused on promoting NUPLAZID to physicians who treat PDP patients, including neurologists, psychiatrists and healthcare professionals caring for patients in long-term care setting. This sales force is supported by an experienced sales leadership team. Our experienced commercial team comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, key account management, patient access services, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, health outcomes, medical affairs, quality control, and compliance. 
 We launched NUPLAZID in May 2016, and our focus is to continue to establish NUPLAZID as the standard of care for patients with PDP. In order to help us achieve this goal, we are continuing to increase awareness of NUPLAZID’s benefits in PDP with a prescriber and patient education campaign consisting of key opinion leader speaker programs, attendance at medical meetings, digital outreach, multimedia campaigns, and direct-to-patient programs.
 In selected markets outside of the United States in which NUPLAZID may be approved, if any, we may choose to commercialize NUPLAZID independently or by establishing one or more strategic alliances.
 In addition, in preparation for a potential U.S. launch of pimavanserin in DRP, we will need to increase the U.S. sales force significantly, and expand our market access, patient services and commercial, medical affairs and general and administrative support functions.
 Long-Lived Assets
 Our tangible long-lived assets are comprised of intangible assets and property and equipment. Our property and equipment totaled $9.2 million, $3.2 million, and $3.3 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All of our tangible long-lived assets are located in the United States. Our intangible assets, comprised of right-of-use assets and other intangibles acquired, totaled $48.4 million, $12.1 million and $4.1 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 Employees and Human Capital
 Employees. At December 31, 2020, we had 601 total employees. We added 98 new employees in 2020. Our employee base includes physicians, scientists and professionals across research and development, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, sales, finance, legal and other functions that are important to our business. In 2021 we anticipate continuing to grow our number of employees. We also will continue to use temporary workers in certain instances in order to maximize our employment flexibility in light of our business needs. Additionally, when we think it is in the best interest of our business we will rely upon external expertise rather than our internal employee base. 
 Employee Engagement, Benefits & Development. We believe that our future success is dependent upon our ability to recruit, hire and retain exceptional employees. We provide our employees with competitive cash compensation, opportunities to own equity, and an employee benefit program that promotes well-being, including healthcare, retirement planning and paid vacation time. We also provide employees with opportunities to continue their education and growth, including leadership development and tuition reimbursement. In order to receive feedback from our employees and evaluate our level of employee engagement, we regularly conduct an employee survey.
 Diversity & Inclusion. We value diversity across our workforce and we will continue to focus on diversity and inclusion initiatives. We seek to have an inclusive and positive culture that is centered on our shared corporate mission and values.
