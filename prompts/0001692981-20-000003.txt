Historical Mineral Resources
 
This annual report contains estimates of historic mineral resources that we have not verified or relied upon for economic evaluation. Such estimates are labelled as historical mineral resources, and they do not refer to any category of sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the NI-43-101 Instrument such as Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves as stated in the 2010 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.
Summary
 
Venture Vanadium Inc., formerly known as Aura Energy Inc. and as Arcom (the Company) is focused on the evaluation and development of early-stage vanadium exploration opportunities. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 26, 2016. We have only one officer and director who is Ian Ilsley. We were previously engaged in the production of wood-manufactured bow ties in China, Hunan Province. This activity has now ceased. 
 
On June 12, 2019, we entered into an assignment agreement with Ian Ilsley to assign his rights and obligations under an option agreement (the Option Agreement) with Mr. Fayz Yacoub where Mr. Yacoub agreed to grant an exclusive option to acquire an undivided one hundred percent (100%) interest in and to 30 mineral claims in property representing 1,789.80 hectares (4,422.69 acres) situated in Quebec, Canada (the Desgrosbois Property). 
 
Under the terms of the assignment agreement, we issued 50,000 shares to Ian Ilsley on June 21, 2019 and issued a further 50,000 shares ninety days thereafter in consideration for him having entered into the assignment agreement.
 
On November 22, 2019, we entered into the Amended and Restated Desgrosbois Option Agreement amending certain terms of the Option Agreement. Under the Amended and Restated Agreement, we acquired a 100% title to the Desgrosbois Property in exchange for a $70,000 cash payment, the issuance of 1,000,000 shares and the grant of a two per cent net smelter return on all metals extracted from the Desgrosbois Property
 
On February 1, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 12-for-1 forward split which increased the number of outstanding shares of common stock from 4,440,000 to 53,280,000. Unless otherwise stated, share amounts presented in this annual report are reported on a post-split basis.
Market for Our Proposed Product
 
We are focused on the evaluation and development of early-stage vanadium and rare earth metal exploration opportunities. We do not presently market or sell any vanadium or other products. The most important use of vanadium is as an additive for steel. It is used for the production of rust resistant, spring and high speed tool steels. It is also added to steels to stabilise carbides. Vanadium has also been shown to be an essential component of certain grid storage batteries, but large-scale production of such batteries has yet to occur. According to the Cision PR Newswire, the worldwide market for vanadium is poised to reach over US$26.4 Billion by the year 2025, with the use of vanadium in iron and steel production bringing in healthy gains and adding significant momentum to global growth. 

Key factors driving the market growth include the accelerating demand for grid scale battery storage, the aviation and automobile industries.

Our current mandate is to identify, evaluate and develop early-stage vanadium exploration opportunities. Our viability and potential success lie in our ability to acquire, exploit, develop and generate revenue from mineral interests. The exploration of mineral deposits involves significant financial risks over a long period of time which even with a combination of careful evaluations, experience and knowledge may not be eliminated. It is impossible to ensure that proposed exploration programs will be profitable or successful. We might not ever generate revenues.
 
We have not generated any revenue from current operations since inception and do not expected to generate revenue for the foreseeable future as we engage in exploratory activities.
 
If we are not able to locate a viable mineral deposit, we would suffer a material adverse effect on our operations and we would be forced to cease operations or change them entirely.

Initial Project
 
We have titles to projects located on the Desgrosbois Property. The property is located on map sheet 31J01 of the National Topographic System (NTS) of Canada . The Desgrosbois Property is located in southern Quebec in the regional municipality of Sainte-Agathe des-Monts, Terrebonne and Argenteuil townships. The Desgrosbois Property extents north-south between Highway 117 and the south-eastern shore of Lake Manitou. From there, it continues along an east-west direction overlying in part lakes Cornu, Long and de La Blanche. 
 
The Desgrosbois Property is within 800 meters of the Ivry Property. We do not currently own titles to the Ivry Mine itself, but our license area covers the immediate surrounding area, and we discuss it in this report as we believe it is helpful in understanding Fe-Ti-V mineralization in the area. We cannot guarantee that the mineral deposits on the two properties will be similar or that reports on the Ivry properties will accurately predict mineralization on the Desgrobois Property. The Ivry Property consists of 30 contiguous mineral claims (polygons) for a total area of 1,790 hectares or 17.90 km2. The claim block is centered at coordinates 74.430º W Long. And 46.080° N. Lat. or UTM coordinates 544091m E and 5103135m N (NAD83; Zone 18N). In November 2019, the title to two claims hosting the Ivry mine lapsed, and a staking application to acquire these claims were made on behalf of Venture Vanadium. We are optimistic that we will obtain title to these claims in the coming week, which will result in our Desgrosbois property becoming 32 claims instead of 30 claims and for a total of 1,909.33 hectares or 19.09 Km2, but we might never obtain such titles. The property is centred at coordinates 74.430º W Long. And 46.080° N. Lat. or UTM coordinates 544091m E and 5103135m N (NAD83; Zone 18N).
 
There are two past producing Fe-Ti mines within the confines of the Desgrosbois Property. The old Ivry mine is a horse shoe-shaped pit revealing a body of massive hemoilmenite (ilmenitite). A helicopter-borne magnetic survey completed in December 2007 revealed strong magnetic highs concentrated in the north-eastern corner of the Desgrosbois Property around the old Desgrosbois-Ivry deposits and to the south-western extremities. Strong magnetic lows appear in the vicinity of the old Ivry and Desgrosbois pits in the north-eastern portion of the Desgrosbois Property. These regions constitute targets for future exploration. According to the NI 43-101 technical report by Mr. Michel Boily, the 2007 helicopter survey reveals several exposures of massive veins and irregular bodies of magnetite±ilmenite located directly north of the Desgrobois mine. There is also a sector within the Desgrosbois property that we refer to as the Titanium development sector as it had previously been drilled by Titanium Development Corporation. 
 
Access to the Desgrosbois Property is via Highway 15 going north from Montreal for roughly 80 km until the Highway 15 changes into Highway 117. From there, there are numerous paved and gravel roads that crisscross the property site. Travelling 8.0 km NNW from the Highway 117/15 intersection, turn back at a crossing to re-engage Highway 117 in a SSW direction for 310 meters. The pit and the mineral occurrence, or showing, of Fe-Ti on the Desgrosbois property is situated just 40 to 50 m south of the roadside.
 
Access to the old Ivry mine, is also via Highway 15 to Highway 117. About one kilometer after their intersection, turn left onto Chemin Renaud. 3.6 km later, arriving at a small bridge crossing over Lake Manitou, near the Ivry Townhall, take the Chemin du lac de la Grise road for 1.74 km. The ancient dirt path going to the old Ivry Mine can be seen on the south side of the road. The mine is located 380 m to the south. 
 
The nearest major town to the Desgrosbois Property is Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts (pop. 10,223), which is situated only 5 km SE of the main Ivry showing. It harbors a hospital, commerce and restaurants. This region of the Canadian Shield, the Lower Laurentians, is a well-known summer and winter resort area. There are numerous summer houses and camping grounds dispersed around the many lakes and rivers surrounded by rolling hills. During winter, cross-country and alpine skiing are the main economic activities of the region as well as snowmobile rides. Montreal (pop. 1,705,000) located just 80 km south of Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts can provide all the technical expertise, manpower and resources necessary for the development of a mining property.
 
History of the Desgrosbois Property
 
The first serious geological and metallogenic investigation of the Ste-Agathe-des-Monts and St-Jovite regions is that of F.F. Osborne (1936) who described and mapped the geology of the Morin Complex, a 2,500 sq km batholith complex emplaced into the crust of Quebec, in particular and proceeded to establish an inventory of the mineralized zones of the area, which includes the Desgrosbois property. J.I. McGerrigle (1961, 1962) systematically mapped a region corresponding to part of the NTS sheet 31J01 in the Beresford

Township. The area includes the old Ivry and Desgrosbois mines and covers exclusively the anorthosites of the Morin Complex. Rose (1969) provides a geological summary of the Fe-Ti deposits occurring within the Morin Complex anorthosites. A wealth of petrological, geological and structural studies concern directly the Morin Complex (see Martignole and Shriver, 1970; Emslie, 1975 and Doïg, 1991). In particular, Emslies report gives a detailed description of the prevalent rock types of the Morin Complex. We can only interpret the drill log in a general way without spatial constraints. In general, the core stratigraphy reveals zones of hemoilmenite (ilmenitite) layers reaching in some cases 20 to 30 meters in apparent thickness alternating with zones of disseminated ilmenite injections. 
 
The Desgrosbois Deposit
 
1913 - The Desgrosbois deposit was discovered in 1913 by Dulieux (1913) who collected samples from lot 39 and 40 (Range VI, Argenteuil Township) and later submitted them to chemical assaying and beneficiation.
1949- The Desgrosbois Property was acquired by Pershing Amalgamated Mines Ltd. which carried out a systematic dip needle survey. That company opened a small pit on the northern flank of a small hill in lot 39, 80 meters from Road 117. The pit is 55 meters long and 40 meters wide.
 
1950- R. Leblanc reported historical mineral resources of 30,000 tons per vertical feet on lots 40 and 41 and 16,000 tons per vertical feet on lot 39 (Bourret, 1958).
 
1952- A detailed magnetometer survey was conducted over lots 38 to 41. Two strong magnetic anomalies were detected. A circular anomaly with a diameter of approximately 225 meters, situated in lot 39 and in the west part of lot 38, extended south and east of the open cut. The other anomaly was located on a rise on the west side of a swamp opposite to the open pit. 
 
1953-1958- Laboratory tests and beneficiation of ore samples were conducted. A 1955 report produced by N. Soludocha evaluated the commercial utilization of titaniferous magnetite detailing the production costs and the design of the projected plant and equipment. In 1956 grinding tests were performed by Aerofall Mills Co. (Ensio, 1956; GM 05103C). We have accurate information relative to the location of the core holes drilled during the 1958 campaign at the old Desgrosbois mine. All DDH are vertical and reach thicknesses ranging from 40 to 80 meters. The core sections illustrate massive magnetite-ilmenite zones reaching 50 meters in thickness with subordinate sections of disseminated mineralization commonly occurring within the first 30 meters of core. The overall impression of the mineralization is of a subhorizontal mass comprised in a 220 x 110 meter area with a thick N and NW section near the old Desgrosbois pit tapering gradually toward the southeast. A subhorizontal section of disseminated magnetite-ilmenite mineralization is present in the first 30 meters. The histograms of the Fe (wt. %) and TiO2 (wt. %) assays extracted from the core logs of Hendricks (1958; GM 11645), indicate similar skewed shapes reflecting the dominance of massive titanomagnetite sections. Average concentrations of the Desgrosbois mineralization are: 37.5±7.6 wt. % Fe and 10.20±2.34 wt. % TiO2. Hendricks (1954) established a calculation that indicated historical mineral resources of 5.523 Mt of ore grading 40.82 wt. % Fe and 10.99 wt. % TiO2 with an average thickness of 30 meters. The ore zone lies in an elliptical shaped area with long and short dimension of 300 and 200 meters respectively.
 
1959-1960 - Lumau Mining Corp. acquired the mining rights on the Desgrosbois Property and adjacent claims on which a ground-based magnetometer survey was conducted (Hendricks, 1960; GM 11645). Brossard (1960; GM 10250) collected 20 samples around the Desgrosbois pit in the southern part of lot 39, range V. The assay results produced an average of 31.96 wt. % Fe and 8.47 wt. % TiO2
 while the massive material went as high as 45.5 wt. % Fe and 11.2 wt. % TiO2.
 
1968-1970 - Nine DDH were drilled at the periphery or in the center of the Desgrosbois pit, while three other holes were placed on the northern side of Highway 117 in lot 38, range VI on what was called the Yates-Hanckock property (Anonymous, 1968; GM 23497 and Anonymous, 1971; GM 26675).
 
2019  Date  In January 2019, an updated N43-101 report was completed by Michel Boily who produced an earlier report on the licenses. A copy of this N43-101 is available on our website. In September 2019, we commissioned On Track Exploration (OTE), an entity controlled by the then owner of the titles that were the subject of the report, to engage the Geogenius Exploration Consulting team to assess the Fe-Ti-V metalliferous potential of these properties in the Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts area, Quebec, Canada. 
 The purpose of this exploration campaign is to describe the previous work done and to present new sampling results with an emphasis on vanadium potential. All of the work consists of a site visit, geological geophysical anomaly reconnaissance, drone aerial photography, identification of old boreholes, sampling in the areas of interest, positioning with exact samples, cutting of samples for metallogeny and preparation of sampling maps. 
 The consulting] team consisted of geologists Stewart Jackson (PhD, P.Geo, Q.P.), a senior consultant to Venture Vanadium, Inc., Fayz Yacoub (P.Geo, President of On-Track Exploration Ltd. and the then owner of the titles on the Desgrobois property), and author Jocelyn Pelletier (Msc, P. Geo, independent consultant geologist). The field assistants were experienced geo-technicians, Jean- Claude

Ligot and Sean Lecler. For access logistics, the team was based in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, and the trip was done by SUV pickup truck. 
 The fieldwork was carried out the last week of August 2019, the samples were prepared on August 31 and in September 2019, and the maps and the report were produced during the months of September and October 2019. On September 11, 2019, a due diligence visit was done by Ian Ilsley (President of Venture Vanadium Inc.) and Jocelyn Pelletier. 
 In connection with the September 2019 visit, the following procedures were applied:
 1) Exploration methods 
 Exploration activities were conducted at all times under the supervision of a geologist member of Canadian professional order. The location of reconnaissance activities was done using maps from previous work, GPS (Garmin GPS-62), aerial imagery from Google Earth and drone. The stripping work was light as it was done by hand. Many drill hole casings were found during the reconnaissance survey in the mineralized area. 
 For quality assurance and quality control, all the sampling activity was done under my supervision as qualified and independent person. All of the samples were collected by Jocelyn Pelletier or Sean Leclerc. Independent consultants took representative samples. All samples were identified, reviewed, photographed and packaged under my supervision during the preparation of sending samples. Throughout the stay the samples were kept under lock and key in my vehicle and the samples were sent by myself to the shipping center, where the samples were delivered directly to the Chimitec laboratory in Val d'Or, Quebec. 
 2) Sampling work 
 A total of 45 samples were collected for all areas of the mineralized showings. Most of samples were chip samples (20 to 60cm) crosscutting the mineralized zones, but they should be considered as continual non-selective samples. The mineralized area shows ore zones with variation of concentration of mineralization with podiform/pockets shape at small scale, but can be considered homogeneous composition at large scale. 
 Below is the subdivision of the sampling: 
 - 25 samples in the Desgrosbois sector, including 22 in the mine pit. 
 - 19 samples in the Ivry-East area. 
 - 1 sample in the Titanium development sector (see figure 4 below)
 Three (3) maps were produced with sampling made this September 2019. Samples are located with a precision of ±1m, based GPS location and physical position with an aerial image made by a drone flying at 120m altitude. The maps produced cover these areas: 
 Desgrosbois mining pit (22 samples)  figure 1 
 Desgrosbois North (3 samples)  figure 2 
 Ivry-East (19 samples) + Titanium development (1 sample)  figure 3 
 Sampling maps provide the mineralized trends and grades for each area (see below).

 Property Potential 
 1) Desgrosbois Deposit 
 We believe that Desgrosbois is the sector that shows the greatest potential, because the pit of the old mine on the surface shows the mineralization of gabbro rich in Fe-Ti-V oxides. The gabbro seems to form bands and podiform zones in the anorthosite. From surface and old documentation of the drilling, the mineralized bodies forms accumulation of massive (40-80%) magnetite-ilmenite (figure 11) in orthopyroxene rich zone, bordered by a diffusion halo (1-15%) of iron oxides in the anorthosite. Magnetite-ilmenite forms crystals size of 1-8mm in the gabbro zone, while 1-2mm in the mineralized halo in the anorthosite surrounding the gabbro zone. 
 The Desgrosbois deposit has had 21 holes (3,910 feet) drilled in it which along with surface mapping and magnetic surveys of about 100 acres, In 1953 an estimate of 5.527 Mtons of massive high-grade iron ore- titanium on (anomaly A) grading 40.81% iron and 10.99% titanium dioxide (figure 11). There is also a halo of 1.051.Mtons of disseminated material grading 25.67 % iron and 6.66% 

10
 

titanium dioxide around the high grade zone. Another highly magnetic body (anomaly B) measuring 182m (600 feet) length by 15.2-45.7m (50-150 feet) width tested by one drill hole intersected 12.2m (40 feet) of iron ore titanium mineralization grading 44.73% iron and 11.56% titanium dioxide. 
 2) Titanium Development Deposit 
 The Titanium development sector of the Desgrosbois property, located approximately 500 meters to the south east of the Ivry Mine, shows only one outcrop on the surface, i.e. an anorthosite with low iron oxide release. Several drill casings testify to soundings, which are the only tools for understanding the body mineralized below. According to these ancient, drilling works the mineralization would be hematite, so a more oxidized expression of the mineralization. As for the vanadium grades, we do not know the mineralization results, because we do not have any drilling samples and, because they are made of hematite, we cannot predict the grades. 
 In 1958, a total of 1,228m (4,029 feet) of diamond drilling was drilled by Titanium Development Corporation and an estimate of 2.869 Mtons grading 38.5% iron and 30.84% titanium dioxide was delineated as drill indicated reserves for open pit mining method to the deposit. 
 The Ivry Deposit
 
We do not own titles to the Ivry Property but discuss it in this report as we believe it is helpful in understanding Fe-Ti-V mineralization in the area as the Desgrosbois Property is linked to the Ivry Property claims. We cannot guarantee that the mineral deposits on the two properties will be similar or that reports on the Ivry properties will accurately predict mineralization on the Desgrobois Property. Additionally, a staking application to acquire these claims were made on behalf of Venture Vanadium. We are optimistic that we will obtain title to these claims in the near term,
 
1910-1918- The Ivry ilmenite deposit was opened in 1910. From 1912 to 1918, when production terminated, a total of about 16,000 tons of ilmenite ore was shipped to the Titanium Alloy Company of Niagara Falls, New York for use in the manufacture of ferrotitanium, a deoxidizer of steel (Rose, 1969).
 
1951-1952 - The results of a magnetic survey performed by R.J.M. Baxter, which suggested that the Ivry deposit extends to the east by outlining a magnetic zone 2790 m2 in extent, has been described by Leblanc (1951; GM 01119). The latter also refers to a magnetic separation test and assays for Ti and Fe performed by the American Smelting Company. In 1952, Hagan (1952; GM02057) put forward a detailed plan for open pit development of the old Ivry mine. A geophysical survey of the Ivry site was conducted by Geo-Technical Development Co. along NS traverse lines for a total of 8.34 km (Hough, 1952; GM 01726). 
 
Titanium Development Corporation conducted a drilling program southeast of the deposit in the eastern half of lot 36 and in lot 37. The location of the drill holes fall within a well-defined negative magnetic anomaly detected from a heliborne geophysical survey conducted in December 2007. The drilling program consisted of 16 holes totaling of 1228 m of core. The azimuth and plunge (45º) of each DDH is known from the report of Hough (1952), however the exact location of each hole is unknown so we can only interpret the drill log in a general way without spatial constraints, In general, the core stratigraphy reveals zones of massive hemoilmenite (ilmenitite) layers reaching in some cases 20 to 30 meters in apparent thickness alternating with zones of disseminated ilmenite injections. There are numerous barren anorthosite zones of moderate apparent thickness (e.g. 10 cm to 5 meters) appearing throughout the mineralized column. The apparent depth reached by the 16 holes varies from 40 to 175 meters which corresponds with a plunge of 45º to real thicknesses of 28 to 124 meters. A histogram of the TiO2 (wt. %) assays extracted from Hough (1952). The compilation relates only to massive and disseminated ore. The skewed shape of the histogram reflects the variation from disseminated to massive ore. However, the average TiO2 concentration is high: 29.6±5.3 wt. %.
 
Hough (1952) established an evaluation for the Titanium Development Corporation that produced historical resources of 2.95 Mt averaging 30.84 wt. % TiO2 and 38.5 wt. % Fe. This figure represents material grading in excess of 30 wt. % TiO2 taken to a depth of 100 m below the surface.
 
1958-1959- McGerrigle (1962) mentioned that in 1958, 58 DDH totaling 1103 meters were drilled in the eastern part of lot 38. The report does not state the name of the company for which the core drilling was done. 
 
1975 - An extensive study concerning the development of the bulk leach system for the recovery of low-residual titanium dioxide from titaniferous ores was carried out for the Ministère des Richesses naturelles du Quebec in 1975 by International Titanium Development. The report also delved on the beneficiation of ore by magnetic separation, gravity separation, flotation of sulfides from the ore, electrostatic separation, ore leaching and hydrolysis of TiO2.
 
2007- A helicopter-borne magnetic geophysical survey of 400 line-km was flown over the Ivry Property by GPR Géophysique Inc. on behalf of Trijet Mining Corp. Results from the helicopterborne magnetic survey conducted over the Ivry Property are illustrated by the Total Magnetic Intentsity (TMI) maps (Figures 6, 7) (Boily, 2009). The TMI displays apparently a complex pattern of magnetic highs and lows, the former concentrated in the northern area of the old Ivry- Desgrosbois Property. The strong magnetic highs are found in the northeastern corner of the property around the Desgrosbois deposit and to the southwestern extremities. Gabbroic bodies correspond to strong magnetic highs on the maps. Oriented linear or curved features underlined by moderate magnetic highs could

corresponds to bands or layers of fine- grained mafic or gabbroic anorthosite or gabbroic lenses that may constitute more than 10% of the rock exposures in certain domains of the Morin Complex (see McGerrigle, 1962). The magnetic lows mainly occur in the vicinity of the Ivry and Desgrosbois pits. The regions revealing strong magnetic lows (TMI) or important negative First Vertical Derivative (FVD) values were interpreted as an indication of Fe-Ti oxide mineralization at depth principally composed of hemoilmenite or ilmenite (Boily, 2009).
 
2008 - Abitibi Geophysics Inc. (Boulanger and Cifuentes, 2008) completed a ground based gravimetric survey along a grid established in the vicinity of the old Ivry mine. The results of the ground-based gravity survey conducted in the area surrounding the old Ivry pit are presented in the form of Bouguer Anomaly map. The map reveals anomalous areas corresponding to rock bodies with higher densities than the surrounding anorthositic background (2.74 g/cm3). The gravity survey suggests that the excess mass may correspond to densities of 4.1 g/cm3 a composite of ilmenite and magnetite ore. They are in close spatial association with positive and negative anomalous zones detected by the airborne mag survey.
 
A three-dimensional geophysical inversion model was completed to estimate a net tonnage of the ilmenite-magnetite-rich bodies by choosing a density contrast threshold of 0.3 g/cm3 (mixed rock of anorthosite and ilmenite±magnetite mineralization) and of 0.5 g/cm3, (corresponding to a density interval of 3.24 to 4.09 g/cm3, showing the more dense rock). Boily (2009) devoted six days on the western end of the property exploring and collecting samples of Fe-Ti mineralized rocks as well as sampling the principal host lithologies. A prospector was hired for three days to roam and to collect samples from two principal hot zones that were most susceptible to contain Fe-Ti mineralization. These areas were outlined by the location of the airborne magnetic anomalies outlined by Abitibi Geophysics and the recognition of Fe-Ti mineralization by the author and as well as by McGerrigle (1962). Samples from the old Ivry pit, four of these samples represent the hemoilmenite mineralization (ilmenitite) and two of the anorthosite gangue were collected by Boily (2009) and the chemical analyses were compared to that of published assays from the Ivry ore sampled since the early 1900s.
 
Two anorthosite specimen, one containing disseminated hemoilmenite (MBIV07-08), were also analyzed. The samples from the Desgrosbois mine come from the pit walls and are typical of the gabbroic anorthosite (leuconorite) of the Morin Complex. The west Ivry sampled area was within boundaries delineated to the north by a NE-SW oriented line following lakes Brazeau, Nelly and Caché and to the south by the Chemin des Lacs road. The Fe2O3T concentrations vary from 14.94 to 33.31 wt. % with an average of 19.77±5.76 whilst TiO2 ranges from 2.74 to 6.12 wt. %, averaging 4.15±1.02 wt. %. The most interesting assay values are provided by two samples collected from outcrops located west of Lake Brazeau with Fe2O3T concentrations of 24.16 to 33.13 wt. % and 5.17 to 6.12 wt. % TiO2. From the North Desgrosbois zone, the best samples representing the massive ore, DG0804 and DG0805, contain 65.77 and 67.91 wt. % Fe2O3T with 14.45 and 11.20 wt. % TiO2 respectively. The high concentrations of Fe2O3T in the massive ore can be correlated with those obtained for the 1958 drill core south of the Desgrosbois pit. The North Desgrosbois zone massive ore samples carry relatively high V2O5 concentrations (0.28-0.35 wt. %) which are slightly lower than those quoted by Boily (2009) for the Ivry massive ilmenite ore (V2O5=0.48-0.51 wt. %). These results also confirm the unexplored potential of the Desgrosbois Property for economic vanadium mineralization.
 2019  Date  To be read in conjunction with the sampling data in Table 1 above. We do not own the Ivry mine, but include this information the Ivry deposit is adjacent to the Desgrosbois deposit, and as such we believe it is helpful for understanding Fe-Ti-V mineralization in the area. Additionally, A staking application to acquire these claims were made on behalf of Venture Vanadium. We are optimistic that we will obtain title to these claims, are currently being acquired by by Venture Vanadium Inc. The walls of more than 8 meters in height show massive oxide bodies, rather tabular and horizontal. 
 The Ivry Mine is a past producing mine with a production records of 163,000 tons at 47% Fe and 19 % TiO2. Four mineralized zones were delineated by the drilling for a total of 9,530 tons/vertical foot. 
 Open pit potential for iron ore was the main focus at the time of discovery and the economic potential for titanium was totally ignored thus, tonnage and grade for underground potential never been in the exploration plan and accordingly deep exploration holes never been drilled in the past to investigate the down extension of all three deposits. 
 Ivry-East is also a potential area, as mineralization forms massive magnetite-ilmenite mineralized bodies that extend into the Ivry mine pit. The shape of the bodies is distinguishable only on a single stripping and some outcrops and seems to show tabular lenses slightly puddled body. There appears to be a link between the orientation and dip of the ore bodies of the Ivry mine and those of the Ivry-East extension. 
 Metallogeny 
 Whether from the old mine pits or from the drill holes, we believe that the mineralized bodies seem to form horizontal and tabular lens bodies surrounded by Fe-Ti dissemination halo in the Morin anorthosite. The mineralization is made of Fe-Ti-V oxides, mostly magnetite-ilmenite for the Desgrosbois mine and the Ivry mine. Whereas some mineralized zones are described as hematite and titanite ore in drilling performed in the Titanium development zone, oxidation of the oxide formation would have varied over time, and perhaps even as a function of the depth of crystallization of the magma, meaning that Hematite ore could be under-estimated when it does not create electromagnetic anomalies.

Assays show a clear correlation with iron and vanadium, which validate the hypothesis of substitution in magnetite. There is good correlation with high grade iron ore and titanium. There is an opposite correlation between silicate and high-grade iron-titanium ore. 
 The sampling seems to show a correlation between Ti and iron, where all the mineralized samples contained important concentration of magnetite and ilmenite. It is known that magnetite can have the substitution of Fe for V in its mineralogical structure. On the other hand, the structure of ilmenite does not show a metal ion substitution of Ti or Fe. 
 
Geological Setting
 
The Desgrosbois Property is composed of 98% true anorthosite that belongs to anorthosites of the Morin Complex known as the Mauve Facies of the western domain. The anorthosite contains < 10 % of mafic minerals, the gabbroic anorthosite 10 to 22.5 %, the anorthositic gabbro 22.5 to 35% and the gabbro > 35% (McGerrigle, 1962). The true anorthosite is commonly purplish in color, with frequent grayish varieties It is generally massive, although we observe gneissic structures in certain outcrops. The anorthosite is a coarse-grained rock which is crosscut by thin dykes of a fined grained variety. Vitreous plagioclase and pyroxene phenocrysts reaching 15 and 25 cm respectively give a porphyritic texture to the rock. The anorthosite is composed in majority of plagioclase feldspar (andesine to labradorite). The pyroxenes hyperstene and augite are the principal ferromagnesian minerals accompanied by smaller contents of biotite and hornblende. These mafic minerals may locally form segregations reaching 2 meters in thickness. Quartz composes less than 3 % of the rock and is probably secondary (McGerrigle, 1962). The principal accessory and alteration minerals are apatite, chlorite, calcite, sericite and pyrite with occasional scapolite, schorlite and spinel. Hemoilmenite is always disseminated but generally constitutes less than 2% of the rock. However, hemoilmenite may be abundant in the irregular bands and finer-grained mafic anorthosites, reaching more than 10% of the rock. These bands are mostly observed to the west and northwest of Lake Manitou.
 
As the proportion of ferromagnesian minerals increases, the anorthosite changes into a gabbroic anorthosite, anorthositic gabbro (leucogabbro) and gabbro. The gabbroic rocks are generally more fined-grained than the anorthosite and we can observe a crude to well-developed gneissic structure. These gabbroic rocks vary from purplish to pale grey in color and contain hemoilmenite, quartz and apatite with occasional garnet.
 
Structure
 
In certain areas, the anorthosite reveals a primary foliation defined by alternate layers of different granulometry or by irregular bands of mafic minerals and large plagioclase phenocrysts. This foliation is generally EW-oriented, except along the western limit of the ancient property where it strikes NW-SE. The dips are generally steep, although they may become shallow-dipping (<30º) or remain almost subhorizontal. A secondary steeply-dipping, EW secondary foliation is underlined by the mylonitization of the anorthosite. In certain areas, it crosscuts the primary structures while in others it is parallel to it. The anorthosites are characterized by a well developed diaclase system. Some diaclases are oriented EW and subvertical while others are steeply dipping and show orientations varying from NS to NNW.
Deposit Type
 
The numerous deposits of vanadium-rich titaniferous magnetite, magnetite-ilmenite-apatite and massive ferroan ilmenite in the Grenville Province of Quebec are known since the 1850s. In general, the deposits occur as tabular intrusions, stocks, sills or dykes in anorthosite massifs. Locally, they consist of stratiform mineralization in layered segment of anorthosite massifs or in layered mafic intrusions (Corriveau and Perreault, 1999). The old Ivry and Desgrosbois deposits belong to the magmatic disseminated Fe-Ti oxides (Timagnetite and ilmenite) type hosted in anorthosite or mafic intrusions. The Fe-Ti mineralization is either distributed as disseminated grains or concentrated in layers in the host anorthosite and associated rocks (e.g. leuconorite, gabbro, and norite). The mineralization is composed of Tipoor magnetite or titaniferous magnetite, with ilmenite, subordinate amounts of Fe-rich spinel (hercynite) and ferromagnesian silicates and plagioclase. The emplacement of these massive Fe-Ti-rich rocks is attributed to an oxide-rich liquid derived from a parental oxide-rich norite, ferrodiorite or jotunite magma emplaced either as a crystal mush or in solid state during the crystallization and cooling of anorthosite massifs (Force, 1991; Duchesne, et al., 1999 and Lindsley, 2003). Oxide ores, whether titanomagnetite or 3399 hemoilmenite, can form by gravitational accumulation from a ferrogabbro parent magma, and by extension, from ferrodiorite. It is proposed that extensive oxide orebodies are consistent with settling and sorting of dense Fe-Ti oxide crystals in a magma chamber (Pang et al., 2008).
Future Acquisitions
 
Although we are seeking to expand in the vanadium and related battery metals market and are constantly seeking additional opportunities, we do not currently have any agreements to acquire additional properties.
Office Facilities

With effect from July 1, 2019, we entered into a lease for a small office space located at One Oxford Center, 301 Grant Street, Suite 4300, Pittsburgh PA 15219. The lease contract was signed for a six-month term and was extended for an additional one-year term thereafter. Our rent expense was approximately $7,230 in our fiscal year ended October 31, 2019.
Competition 
 
The mineral exploration sector is extremely competitive. We compete with many other exploration companies looking for minerals such as 3PL and American Battery Metals. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners. Additionally, we compete for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, rental equipment, and mineral exploration supplies.
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to continue testing soil samples at the Desgrosbois Property, to make a determination as to whether sufficient mineral deposits are present to make the development of the land viable as a source of revenue through the mining and production of vanadium and titanium. Although our testing might not prove successful in detecting vanadium deposits, we believe we can accomplish our goal by implementing the following 24-month business strategy:

● | continued management of the Desgrosbois Property asset, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | database and geographic information system (GIS) construction, 
● | advance our geological testing of the Desgrosbois Property, 
● | begin the regulatory approvals process, 
● | conduct environmental impact tests and prepare reports in preparation for the approvals process and
● | develop plans for mining and exploration of the Desgrosbois Property 

 
Within the next two years, we intend to explore and develop the property as follows: 
 
compile and evaluate the previous database. The property data consists of geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys. The database represents the exploration work conducted on the property area between 1952 and 2004. At that time titanium and vanadium were not the main focus; 
 
undertake a detailed geological study to determine more precisely the extent and the grade of Ti-Fe-V mineralization; 
 
produce a 3D model from historical data, to determine the shape, volume and approximate content of the ore body of each area of interest to give an idea of the potential of these. 
 
continue drilling and bulk sampling the main target areas in order to confirm previous results and to outline the full extent of the Ti-Fe-V mineralization. Reproduce the most successful historical drill holes in order to establish a level of confidence with these historical data; 
 
design exploration adits and pits for a bulk sampling program; 
 
recast detailed drilling and reserve estimates using geological information such as drill intersections and grade, drill spacing, the depth of mineralization, method of sampling, drilling method and consistency of mineralization; 
 
undertake metallurgical test work to establish the best process for separating the vanadium, titanium and Iron from the mineralized ore material; 
 
use the 3D model and geophysics to define the next targets of interest, in order to enlarge their volume; and 
 
make a preliminary assessment of feasibility with emphasis on the economics of the project. 
 
Raw Materials
 
The raw materials for any of our exploration program will include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of suppliers. If heavy machinery and qualified operators are required, we intend to contract the services of professional mining contractors, drillers and geologist.
Dependence on Major Customers
 
We do not currently have any customers as we are in the exploratory and soil sampling phase of our business plan.
 
Intellectual Property

14
 


We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks.
 
Government Controls and Regulations
 
Our business is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. However, we are unable to predict what additional legislation or revisions may be proposed that might affect our business or when any such proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require increased capital and operating expenditures and could prevent or delay certain operations by us.
 
The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. With respect to the regulation of mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclamation and rehabilitation of mining properties following the cessation of operations and, may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time.
 
We are currently in the early exploratory phase of our operations. Should our exploration and testing for vanadium deposits make mining viable, we will begin forming a plan for mining operations to extract such vanadium deposits for commercialization. Mining is a highly regulated industry in the United States and Canada and requires several permits and approvals from various government regulatory bodies on local, state and federal levels. Should we decide that mining operations is commercially viable, there can be no guarantee that such permits and approvals will be granted, which would have a materially adverse effect on our operations.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We currently have no costs to comply with environmental law. However, should we progress in our business plan and decide that mining of vanadium deposits is commercially viable, we will be subject to various environmental laws and regulations on both a federal and state level, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties. While our business is still in its early stages of its ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is important consideration for us. Key aspects of our operations are subject to these laws and regulations. In addition, we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with them.
Expenditures on Research and Development during the Last Two Fiscal Years
 
Since October 31, 2017, we have not spent any funds on either Company-sponsored research and development activities or customer-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, services or techniques or the improvement of existing products, services, or techniques.
Risks We May Face and Other Information
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE

REORGANIZATIONS, PURCHASE OR SALE OF ASSETS
 
On February 1, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect a 12-for-1 forward split which increased the number of outstanding shares of common stock from 4,440,000 to 53,280,000.
 
On May 29, 2019, we entered into a split-off agreement (the Split-Off Agreement) with Hui Liu Ping, our then current sole director and officer, and Ian Ilsley, our Secretary (and now our sole director, President and Treasurer), pursuant to which we sold all of our assets and properties in exchange for her acquisition of all of our debts, adverse claims, liabilities, judgments and obligations. The assets and liabilities assumed by Ms Ping under the terms of the split off agreement consisted of our assets totaling approximately $32 and our liabilities consisted of $36,773 of related party loans. The obligations under those related-party loans were assigned to Ms. Ping as part of the assignment of liabilities. Our assets comprise an option to acquire a 100% interest in over 30 mineral claims (The Desgrosbois Property) representing 1,789.80 hectares (4,422.69 acres) situated in Quebec. We are no longer a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On November 22, 2019, we reached agreement with the owner of the 30 minerals claims optioned to us known as the Desgrosbois Property to make a one-off payment to him in order to 

15
 

exercise the option to purchase the claims and transfer them into 100% to our ownership immediately. The claims are now registered in our name.
 
COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

We have no employees, except our chief executive officer and sole director Ian Ilsley, as of the date of this report. Ian Ilsley currently devotes approximately 30 hours per week to company matters. As our business and operations increase, we will assess the need for full-time management and administrative support personnel.
