Overview
 
  We are a land and water resource development company with 45,000 acres of land in three areas of eastern San Bernardino County, California.  Virtually all of this land is underlain by high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater resources, and is situated in proximity to the Colorado River and the Colorado River Aqueduct ("CRA"), California's primary mode of water transportation for imports from the Colorado River into the State.   Our properties are suitable for various uses, including large-scale agricultural development, groundwater storage and water supply projects. Our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of our land and water resources in an environmentally responsible way.
 
  We believe that the long-term highest and best use of our land and water assets can best be realized through the development of a combination of water supply and storage projects at our properties. Therefore, the Company has been primarily focused on the development of the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project ("Water Project" or "Project"), which will capture and conserve millions of acre-feet1 of native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system beneath our 34,000-acre property in the Cadiz and Fenner valleys of eastern San Bernardino County (the "Cadiz/Fenner Property"), and deliver it to water providers throughout Southern California (see "Water Resource Development"). A second phase of the Water Project would offer storage of up to one million acre-feet of imported water in the aquifer system.   We believe that the ultimate implementation of this Water Project will provide a significant source of future cash flow.
 ___________________________________
 
1 One acre-foot is equal to approximately 326,000 gallons or the volume of water that will cover an area of one acre to a depth of one-foot.  An acre-foot is generally considered to be enough water to meet the annual water needs of one average California household.
  1
 
  The primary factor driving the value of such projects is ongoing pressure on California's traditional water supplies and the resulting demand for new, reliable supply solutions that can meet both immediate and long-term water needs.  Available supply is constrained by environmental and regulatory restrictions on each of the State's three main water sources:  the CRA, the State Water Project, which provides water supplies from Northern California to the central and southern parts of the state, and the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which delivers water from the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to Los Angeles.  Southern California's water providers rely on imports from these systems for a majority of their water supplies, but deliveries from all three into the region have been below capacity over the last several years.
 
  Availability of supplies in California also differs greatly from year to year due to natural hydrological variability.  Over the last several years, California has struggled through an historic drought featuring record-low winter precipitation and reservoir storage levels. However, following a series of strong storms through the 2016-2017 winter, California has received record amounts of rain and snow, eliminating drought conditions in much of Northern California and easing drought in the South. The rapid swing from drought to an extremely wet year has challenged California's traditional infrastructure system, and deliveries into Southern California from the State Water Project, Colorado River Aqueduct and Los Angeles Aqueduct remain below capacity.
 
  The Water Project is a local supply option in Southern California that could help address the region's water supply challenges by providing new reliable supply and local groundwater storage opportunities (see "Water Resource Development" below) in both dry and wet years. The Project has received permits in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") which allow the capture and conservation of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years under the terms of a groundwater management plan approved by San Bernardino County, which is responsible for groundwater use at the Project area. 
 
  Our 2017 working capital requirements relate largely to the final development activities associated with the Water Project and those activities consistent with the Water Project related to further development of our land and agricultural assets.  While we continue to believe that the ultimate implementation of the Water Project will provide the primary source of our future cash flow, we also believe there is significant additional value in our underlying agricultural assets.  Demand for agricultural land with water rights is at an all-time high; therefore, in addition to our Water Project proposal, we are engaged in agricultural joint ventures at the Cadiz/Fenner Property that put some of the groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the underlying aquifer system to immediate beneficial use. We have farmed portions of the Cadiz/Fenner Property since the late 1980s relying on groundwater from the aquifer system for irrigation and have found the site is well suited for various permanent and seasonal crops. Presently, the property has 2,100 acres leased to third parties for a variety of crops, including citrus, dried-on-the-vine raisins and seasonal vegetables.
 
  We also continue to explore additional uses of our land and water resource assets, including renewable energy development, the marketing of our approved desert tortoise land conservation bank, which is located on our properties outside the Water Project area, and other long-term legacy uses of our properties, such as habitat conservation and cultural development.

(a)     General Development of Business
 
  We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1992.  As part of our historical business strategy, we have conducted our land acquisition, water development activities, agricultural operations, and other land development initiatives to maximize the long-term value of our properties and future prospects (see "Narrative Description of Business").
 
  Our initial focus was on the acquisition of land and the assembly of contiguous land holdings through property exchanges to prove the quantity and quality of water resources in this Mojave Desert region of eastern San Bernardino County.  We subsequently established agricultural operations on our properties in the Cadiz/Fenner Valley and sought to develop the water resources underlying that site.  In 1993, we secured permits to develop up to 9,600 acres of agriculture at the Cadiz/Fenner Property and withdraw more than one million acre-feet of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system.  The agricultural operations initially began on 1,900 acres and featured vineyards, citrus orchards and seasonal vegetables.
 
  The agricultural development demonstrated that the geology and hydrology of the property is also uniquely suited and able to support a project that could offer additional water supplies and water storage opportunities in Southern California.
 
  In 1997, we entered into the first of a series of agreements with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("Metropolitan"), the largest water wholesaler in the region and owner of the nearby CRA, to jointly design, permit, and build such a project ("2002 Project").  Between 1997 and 2002, we and Metropolitan received substantially all of the state and federal approvals required to construct and operate the 2002 Project, including a Record of Decision ("ROD") from the U.S. Department of the Interior, which approved the 2002 Project and offered a right-of-way for construction of facilities, including a 35-mile water conveyance pipeline from the Cadiz/Fenner Property to the CRA across federal lands.  In October 2002, Metropolitan's staff brought the right-of-way matter before its Board of Directors.  By a very narrow margin, the Metropolitan Board voted not to accept the right-of-way grant nor proceed with the 2002 Project.
 
  Following Metropolitan's decision, we began to pursue new partnerships and redesigned the 2002 Project to meet the changing needs of Southern California's water providers.  We refocused on the safe and sustainable management of the aquifer system beneath our Cadiz/Fenner Property with the goal of providing a reliable, annual water supply for the region.  To assist with these sustainable management priorities, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Natural Heritage Institute, a leading global environmental organization committed to protecting aquatic ecosystems.  As part of this "Green Compact", we follow stringent plans for groundwater management and habitat conservation.
 
  In September 2008 we entered into a lease agreement with the Arizona & California Railroad Company ("ARZC") to utilize its existing right-of-way between the Cadiz property and the CRA to construct a pipeline able to deliver water from the property into the existing Southern California water transportation system. In 2009, the Department of the Interior evaluated the Water Project's proposed use of an existing railroad right-of-way for a water conveyance pipeline and summarized that the proposed pipeline was within the scope of the right-of-way and required no federal BLM permitting.
  3
 
  Before we began state and local permitting, we commissioned environmental consulting firm CH2M HILL to complete a comprehensive study of the water resources at the Project area.  Following more than one year of analysis, CH2M HILL released its study of the aquifer system in February 2010.  Utilizing new models produced by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2006 and 2008, the study estimated the total groundwater in storage in the aquifer system to be between 17 and 34 million acre-feet, a quantity on par with Lake Mead, the nation's largest surface reservoir.  The study also identified a renewable annual supply of native groundwater in the aquifer system currently being lost to evaporation.  CH2M HILL's findings, which were peer reviewed by leading groundwater experts, confirmed that the aquifer system could sustainably support the Water Project.
 
  Between 2010 and 2011 six Southern California water providers executed option agreements to participate in the new Water Project.  Under our lease agreement, the ARZC also reserved water from the Water Project to further a variety of critical railroad purposes.
 
  In accordance with the CEQA, the Water Project began an environmental review and permitting process in 2011 led by Santa Margarita Water District ("SMWD"), one of the Project participants.  After an extensive review process, the SMWD Board of Directors certified the Final Environmental Impact Report on July 31, 2012 and became the first participating agency to convert its option agreement to a Water Purchase and Sale Agreement for firm supplies from the Water Project. On October 1, 2012, San Bernardino County ("County"), a Responsible Agency under CEQA, also adopted CEQA findings and approved the Project's Groundwater Monitoring, Management and Mitigation Plan ('GMMMP", "Plan") and the withdrawal of 50,000 acre-feet (AF) of water per year for 50 years.
 
  Following receipt of these important approvals, we were named as a real-party-in-interest in nine lawsuits brought by parties seeking a reconsideration of the environmental documents and limitation of the Project approvals granted by SMWD and the County.  Three of these cases were subsequently dismissed or otherwise settled and six lawsuits brought by two petitioners proceeded to trial in Orange County Superior Court ("Court") before one judge in December 2013.  In September 2014, the Court issued final signed judgments ("Judgments") formally denying all claims brought in the six remaining lawsuits.  The Judgments upheld the environmental review and approvals of the Water Project and also awarded costs to SMWD, the County, Cadiz and Fenner Valley Mutual Water Company as the prevailing parties in the cases. 
 
  During the fourth quarter of 2014, the petitioners in the six original Court cases filed independent appeals of the six Judgments with the California Court of Appeals, Fourth District. The appeals cases were heard before a three-judge panel in March 2016. In May 2016, the panel unanimously ruled in favor of the Water Project and in sweeping opinions sustained the lower court rulings. Thereafter, the Petitioners did not seek any additional judicial review and in July 2016, the opportunity for the California State Supreme Court to independently review the six Appellate Court opinions on its own motion passed and all litigation was dismissed. As a result, the County of San Bernardino's approval of the Project is now final and the Company's conservation and extraction of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years under the terms of the groundwater management plan has vested under applicable law.

  While defending the Project's CEQA permits, the Company and the Water Project participants also worked to complete transportation arrangements to convey Project supplies to end users via a pipeline to be constructed within the ARZC right-of-way and the Colorado River Aqueduct ("CRA"), owned by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("Metropolitan").  Following approval of the Project's permits in 2012, the Company and the Project participants began a dialogue with BLM regarding the Project pipeline in response to federal appropriations language that required the Interior Department to certify that the Project's proposed use of the ARZC right-of-way was within its scope.  The dialogue with the BLM occurred over more than two years and culminated in a controversial guidance opinion issued by the BLM California office in October 2015 that did not certify the Project's proposed use. The Company, the ARZC, Water Project participants, Water Project supporters and members of Congress immediately voiced concern about the guidance opinion via letters, statements and meetings with the BLM.  As a result, legislation is pending before Congress that contains provisions that would clarify the scope of the railroad right-of-way to allow third parties to co-locate infrastructure without additional BLM right-of-way permitting. We believe that if signed into law, the language now contained in the House appropriations bill will enable third parties, including the Company, to carry on existing and future activities within existing railroad ROWs over federal lands without the need to secure a separate ROW grant from BLM.
 
  In 2017, we have continued our efforts in support of this legislation and expect to finalize contracts with Project participating agencies, as well as continue final design and implementation planning for Project construction.
 
  Given the strong demand for agricultural land with access to water, in addition to our ongoing efforts to implement the Water Project, we also continue to farm the Cadiz/Fenner Property.  In February 2016 we entered into lease arrangements that allow our farming tenants to further develop the existing agricultural well-field to supply water for their expanded farming use and also enable the Company to acquire the well-field within a twenty-year period through a call feature in the lease and employ these wells as part of the Water Project. The well-field infrastructure and related improvements are substantially similar, regardless of whether the water is applied for agricultural use or conserved for the Water Project.
 
  See "Narrative Description of Business" below for more detail.
 
 (b)     Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
  Our primary business is to acquire and develop land with water resources for various uses, including groundwater supply, groundwater storage and agriculture.  As a result, our financial results are reported in a single segment.  See Consolidated Financial Statements.  See also Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
 
(c)     Narrative Description of Business
 
  Our business strategy is to pursue the development of our landholdings for their highest and best uses.  At present, our development activities include water resource, land and agricultural development.
 
Water Resource Development
 
  Our portfolio of water resources is located in proximity to the Colorado River and the Colorado River Aqueduct ("CRA"), the principal source of imported water for Southern California, and provides us with the opportunity to participate in a variety of water supply, water storage, and conservation programs with public water agencies and other partners.

  The Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project
 
  We own approximately 34,000 acres of land and the subsurface strata, inclusive of the unsaturated soils and appurtenant water rights in the Cadiz and Fenner valleys of eastern San Bernardino County (the "Cadiz/Fenner Property").  The aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation (both rain and snow) within a watershed of approximately 1,300 square miles.  See Item 2, "Properties – The Cadiz/Fenner Valley Property".
 
  The Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project (the "Water Project" or "Project") is designed to supply, capture and conserve billions of gallons of renewable native groundwater currently being lost annually to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our Cadiz/Fenner Property, and provide a new, reliable water supply for approximately 400,000 people in Southern California.  The total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to Water Project participants will not exceed a long-term annual average of 50,000 acre-feet per year for 50 years.  The Water Project also offers participants the ability to carry-over their annual supply, and store it in the groundwater basin from year to year.  A second phase of the Water Project, Phase II, will offer up to one million acre-feet of underground storage capacity that can be used to hold imported water supplies at the Water Project area.
 
  Water Project facilities required for Phase I primarily include, among other things:
 
 
· | High-yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater from beneath the Water Project area;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A water conveyance pipeline to deliver water from the well-field to the CRA for further delivery to Project participants; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An energy source to provide power to the well-field, pipeline and pumping facilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



If an imported water storage component of the Water Project is ultimately implemented in Phase II, the following additional facilities would be required, among other things:
 
 
· | Facilities to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the CRA to the Water Project well-field and/or through the Company's pipeline from Cadiz to Barstow, CA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Spreading basins, which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  In 2016, the Company focused on completing the remaining steps to implement the Project, including clearance to use an existing railroad right-of-way for its conveyance pipeline and defending the Water Project's CEQA permits in the California Court of Appeal. Prior to construction, the Water Project must (1) complete efforts to secure its pipeline right-of-way, (2) finalize contracts with Project participating agencies and secure transportation arrangements to deliver water into each participant's service area, and (3) secure private construction financing. Below is a discussion of present activities to advance these objectives.

(1) | Water Conveyance Pipeline Right-of-Way
----+---------------------------------------



Pipeline from Cadiz to CRA
 
  In September 2008, we secured a right-of-way for the Water Project's water conveyance pipeline by entering into a lease agreement with the Arizona & California Railroad Company ("ARZC"), which operates an active shortline railroad extending from Cadiz to Matthie, Arizona.  The agreement allows for the use of a portion of the railroad's right-of-way to construct and operate a water conveyance pipeline for a period up to 99 years.  The buried pipeline would be constructed parallel to the railroad tracks and be used to convey water between our Cadiz/Fenner Property and the CRA in Freda, California.
 
  Our lease agreement with the ARZC also expressly requires that the Project further several railroad purposes and, under the terms of the lease agreement, the ARZC reserved water supplies from the Project for its operational needs as well as access to Project facilities, such as roads and power appurtenances, for the benefit of its railroad operation.  In September 2013, we also entered into a trackage rights agreement with the ARZC that would enable the operation of steam-powered, passenger excursion trains on the line powered by water made available from the pipeline.
 
  The pipeline route was fully analyzed in the Water Project's Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") as part of the CEQA environmental review process completed in 2012.  As an existing transportation corridor, the route, which avoids sensitive habitats, was found to be the environmentally preferred route for the pipeline.  In 2009, the federal government stated that no federal environmental review of the pipeline route was required under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), because the pipeline was within the scope of the ARZC's right-of-way grant.
 
  Our plan to construct the Project pipeline within the railroad right-of-way is similar to, and modeled after, the thousands of other existing longitudinal uses of rail corridors across the United States today, such as telecommunications lines, natural gas and petroleum product lines and other water lines.  Under the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of March 3, 1875 ("1875 Act"), according to which many of these railroad corridors were established, a railroad can lease its property for third party uses without permitting of the federal government so long as the use also derives from or furthers railroad purposes, at least in part.  This interpretation of the 1875 Act was confirmed by Memorandum Opinion M-37025 issued by the Solicitor of the US Department of the Interior on November 4, 2011 ("2011 M-Opinion"), which state in relevant part:
 
"Within an 1875 Act ROW, a railroad's authority to undertake or authorize activities is limited to those activities that derive from or further a railroad purpose, which allows a railroad to undertake, or others to undertake, activities that have both railroad and commercial purposes, but does not permit a railroad to authorize activities that bear no relationship to the construction and operation of a railroad." (Emphasis added, M-37025)
 
  The Project includes the following features, enabled by the conveyance pipeline, provided in furtherance of railroad purposes:
  7
 

 
· | A new access road along the entire pipeline route to enable maintenance, emergency access and shorten routes for crew-changes,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Remotely operated fire-suppression systems at each of the existing creosote-treated wooden trestles,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Inline power generation for crossing operations and lighting, heating and cooling for existing railroad transloading operations,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Fiber optic information transmission to convey track-speed and cameras in aid of emergency and to discourage vandalism; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The distribution of water for the operation of a steam-powered locomotive, fire-suppression and other miscellaneous uses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  In response to inquiries from the BLM beginning in 2012 about these purposes, the Company, the ARZC and Water Project participants had numerous meetings with the BLM and provided several documents over multiple years for background about the railroad purposes that would be furthered by the Project over several years.  In April 2015 BLM California notified the Company that it was analyzing the Project's proposed use of the ARZC right-of-way and expected to provide the results of this evaluation to the BLM Washington D.C. office by the end of summer 2015.
 
  On October 2, 2015, the Director of the California Office of the BLM signed a letter that would later be sent to ARZC and the Company summarizing that the Project pipeline is outside the scope of the ARZC right-of-way, because a water pipeline would not primarily further a railroad purpose or originate from a railroad purpose, and would therefore require a new federal right-of-way permit prior to construction.  We believe this finding disregards federal law and policy and strays from the framework provided for in the binding 2011 M-Opinion, and therefore we immediately pursued steps to rescind the October determination.
 
  Several Members of Congress raised concerns about the 2015 guidance and its inconsistencies with existing federal policy governing third party railroad right-of-way use.  As a result of inquiries from Congress, BLM California's newly appointed Director met with the Company, the ARZC and Project participants in March 2016.  However, BLM representatives at the meeting were not prepared to discuss the framework utilized to evaluate the Water Project's proposed use of the ARZC right-of-way.
 
  Following the production of documents produced via a Freedom of Information Act request in (June) 2016 regarding BLM's evaluation of the Project's use of the railroad right-of-way, we have had no further formal consultation with BLM California. The guidance letter is under investigation by the House of Representatives Oversight & Government Reform Committee and the Interior Department Inspector General.
 
  Meanwhile, numerous United States congressional representatives have worked to clarify the scope of the congressionally granted 1875 Act right-of-way (ROW) for all who rely on them for necessary infrastructure, including, for example, fiber optics and communications lines, energy, electricity, water, wastewater, sewer, and natural gas lines. In July 2016, language that would clarify the scope of railroad ROW was included in the fiscal year 2017 (FY17) House Interior and Environment Appropriations Bill (H.R.5538), an annual funding measure for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Forest Service, and various related agencies, including the BLM. HR 5538 passed the US House of Representatives in July 2016, but consideration of the bill has been continued until April 2017.   If this language is not considered in April 2017, it could be delayed until the Fall of 2017.  We believe that if signed into law, the language now contained in the House appropriations bill will enable third parties, including the Company, to carry on existing and future activities within existing railroad ROWs over federal lands without the need to secure a separate ROW grant from BLM.

Northern Pipeline
   We currently own a 96-mile existing idle natural gas pipeline from the Cadiz/Fenner Property to Barstow, California that we intend to convert for the transportation of water. The Barstow area serves as a hub for water delivered from northern and central California to communities in Southern California's High Desert.  In addition, the Company holds an option to purchase a further 124-mile segment of this pipeline from Barstow to Wheeler Ridge, California for $20 million.  This option expires in December 2018.
   Initial feasibility studies indicated that, upon conversion, the 30-inch line could transport between 20,000 and 30,000 acre-feet of water per year between the Water Project area and various points along the Central and Northern California water transportation network. As a result this line could create significant opportunities for our water resource development efforts.

  If this pipeline were to become operational, then the Water Project would link two major water delivery systems in California, providing flexible opportunities for both supply and storage.  The Northern Pipeline could deliver Phase I supplies, either directly or via exchange, to existing and potential customers of Phase I of the Project.  It could also be used to import water to the Project area and provide additional groundwater storage for the region's water providers. Such use is currently being contemplated as part of Phase II of the Water Project.    The 96-mile pipeline segment was evaluated in the Water Project's EIR during the CEQA process.  Any use of the pipeline would be conducted in conformity with the Project's GMMMP and is subject to further CEQA evaluation and potentially federal environmental permitting.

  The Northern Pipeline also represents new opportunities for the Company independent of the Water Project to offer water transportation to locations along the pipeline route that are not presently interconnected by existing water infrastructure.  The entire 220-mile pipeline crosses California's major water infrastructure as well as urban and agricultural centers and can be utilized to transport water, independent of the Water Project, between users who presently lack direct interconnections along the pipeline route. We are presently engaged in discussions with parties that may be interested in such transportation.
 
 
(2) | Agreements with Public Water Agencies or Private Water Utilities & Conveyance Arrangements
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



  The Company has executed Letters of Intent, option agreements and purchase agreements (collectively, "Agreements") with public water agencies and private water utilities in California during the Project's development. These participating agencies serve more than one million customers in cities throughout California's San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, Imperial and Ventura Counties.
  9
 
  Santa Margarita Water District ("SMWD") was the first participant to convert its option agreement and adopt resolutions approving a Water Purchase and Sale Agreement for 5,000 acre-feet of water.  The structure of the SMWD purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment, plus a pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs.  The capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the Company over a 30-year term. 
 
  Agreements entered into prior to the beginning of the CEQA review process provide the right to acquire an annual supply of 5,000 acre-feet of water at $775 per acre-foot (2010 dollars, subject to adjustment), which is competitive with the incremental cost of new water.  In addition, these agencies have options to acquire storage rights in the Water Project to allow for the management of their Water Project supplies in complement with their other water resources.  Up to 150,000 acre-feet of carry-over storage is available for reservation by the agencies prior to construction commencement.  Participants that elect to achieve year-to-year flexibility in their use of Project water by utilizing carry-over storage will reserve storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.
 
  Letters of Intent ("LOIs") that have been entered into since completion of the CEQA review process reserve supplies from the Water Project at $960 per acre-foot (2014 dollars, subject to adjustment). These LOIs also include the option to reserve carry-over storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.
 
  Presently, total reservations of supplies from the Water Project via these Agreements are in excess of Water Project capacity and we are working collaboratively with the participating water agencies to account for any oversubscription in the final definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements we enter into with these agencies.
 
  In addition, prior to construction of the Water Project, terms for moving water supplies in the CRA must be negotiated with Metropolitan, which owns and controls the CRA.  Water Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory.  Any agreement as to the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA will be negotiated between and entered into by Metropolitan and the Project participating agencies, not the Company. Discussions with Metropolitan regarding conveyance of Project water in the CRA have been led by SMWD.  We expect arrangements would be approved by Metropolitan staff and considered by its Board following resolution of BLM discussions related to the conveyance pipeline, discussed above.  Once arrangements are reached, Metropolitan must take action as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies.
  
 
(3) | Construction Financing
----+-----------------------


 

  As described above, construction of Phase I of the Water Project would primarily consist of wellfield facilities at the Project site, a conveyance pipeline, and an energy source to pump water through the conveyance pipeline between the Project well-field and the CRA.  The construction of these facilities, which we expect would cost approximately $250 million, will require capital financing that we expect will be secured by the proceeds of our definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements and the new facility assets.  The Company's existing corporate term debt provides us the flexibility to incorporate Water Project construction financing up to $300 million within our current debt structure.

Agricultural Development


  Within the Cadiz/Fenner Property, all of the existing 34,000 acres are currently zoned for agriculture.  In 1993, we secured conditional use permits to develop agriculture on up to 9,600 acres of the property and withdraw groundwater from the underlying aquifer system for irrigation.  We have since maintained various levels of crops on the Property as we developed the Water Project.  In 2013, we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to develop up to 1,480 acres of lemons at the site, 520 acres of which have been planted to date.
 
  In February 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with Fenner Valley Farms LLC ("FVF"), a subsidiary of Water Asset Management LLC, a related party, pursuant to which FVF leased, for a 99-year term, 2,100 acres at the Cadiz/Fenner property to be used to plant, grow and harvest agricultural crops ("FVF Lease").  As consideration for the lease, FVF paid the Company a one-time payment of $12,000,000 in February 2016. The acreage that was historically farmed by the Company and the acreage that is leased to a third party to develop lemons was included within the leased acreage and assumed by FVF.  Following entry into this lease, the Company is no longer directly involved in the current agricultural operations at the site and all of our agricultural revenue is derived pursuant to the FVF lease.
 
  As part of the agricultural development to be conducted under the lease arrangements, the groundwater production capacity of the property's existing well-field is expected to be enhanced through infrastructure improvements that are complementary to the Water Project.    While any additional well-field development for agricultural use would be financed by our agricultural partners as provided under our agricultural lease arrangements, the Company retained a call feature that allows us, at any time in the initial 20 years, to acquire the well-field and integrate any new agricultural well-field infrastructure developed into the Water Project's facilities.
 
Additional Eastern Mojave Properties
 
  We also own approximately 11,000 acres outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in two locations within the Mojave Desert in eastern San Bernardino County.
 
  Our primary landholding outside of the Cadiz area is approximately 9,000 acres in the Piute Valley.  This landholding is located approximately 15 miles from the resort community of Laughlin, Nevada, and about 12 miles from the Colorado River town of Needles, California.  Extensive hydrological studies, including the drilling and testing of a full-scale production well, have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high-quality groundwater.  The aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation (both rain and snow) within a watershed of approximately 975 square miles and could be suitable for a water supply project, agricultural development or solar energy production.  These properties are located in or adjacent to areas designated by the federal government as National Monument, Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and are suitable candidates for preservation and conservation. (see "Land Conservation Bank" below).

  Additionally, we own acreage located near Danby Dry Lake in Ward Valley, approximately 30 miles southeast of our Cadiz/Fenner Valley properties.  The Danby Dry Lake property is located approximately 10 miles north of the CRA.  Initial hydrological studies indicate that the area has excellent potential for a water supply project. Certain of the properties in this area may also be suitable for agricultural development, solar energy development and/or preservation and conservation.
 
Land Conservation Bank
 
  Approximately 10,000 acres of our properties outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area are located within terrain designated by the federal government as Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and have limited development opportunities.  In February 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife approved our establishment of the Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank ("Fenner Bank"), a land conservation bank that makes available approximately 7,500 acres of our properties located within Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat for mitigation of impacts to tortoise and other sensitive species that would be caused by development in the Southern California desert.  Under its enabling documents, the Fenner Bank offers credits that can be acquired by entities that must mitigate or offset impacts linked to planned development.  For example, this bank can service the mitigation requirements of renewable energy, military, residential and commercial development mitigation requirements for projects being considered throughout the desert.  Credits sold by the Fenner Bank will fund our permanent preservation of the land as well as research by outside entities, including San Diego Zoo Global, into desert tortoise health and species protection.
Other Opportunities
 
  Other opportunities in the water and agricultural or related infrastructure business complementary to our current objectives could provide new opportunities for our Company.
 
  Over the longer-term, we believe the population of Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will continue to grow, and that, in time, the economics of commercial and residential development at our properties may become attractive.
 
  We remain committed to the sustainable use of our land and water assets, and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets.  We cannot predict with certainty which of these various opportunities will ultimately be utilized.
 
Seasonality
 
  Our water resource development activities are not seasonal in nature.
 
  Our farming operations have been limited to the cultivation of lemons and grapes/raisins and spring and fall plantings of vegetables on the Cadiz Valley properties.  These operations have been subject to the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry.

Competition
 
  We face competition for the acquisition, development and sale of our properties from a number of competitors.  We may also face competition in the development of water resources and agriculture associated with our properties.  Since California has scarce water resources and an increasing demand for available water, we believe that location, price and reliability of delivery are the principal competitive factors affecting transfers of water in California.
Employees
 
  As of December 31, 2016, we employed 9 full-time employees (i.e. those individuals working more than 1,000 hours per year).  We believe that our employee relations are good.
 
Regulation
 
  Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local laws and regulations.  As we proceed with the development of our properties, including the Water Project, we will be required to satisfy various regulatory authorities that we are in compliance with the laws, regulations and policies enforced by such authorities.  Groundwater development, and the export of conserved groundwater for sale to entities such as public water agencies, is subject to regulation by specific existing statutes, in addition to general environmental statutes applicable to all development projects.  Additionally, we must obtain a variety of approvals and permits from state and federal governments with respect to issues that may include environmental issues, issues related to special status species, issues related to the public trust, and others.  Because of the discretionary nature of these approvals and concerns, which may be raised by various governmental officials, public interest groups and other interested parties during both the development and the approval process, our ability to develop properties and realize income from our projects, including the Water Project, could be delayed, reduced or eliminated.
