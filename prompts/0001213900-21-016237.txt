BUSINESS
 
Our Company
 
We are an early-stage blank check company incorporated in July 2020 as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination.
Initial Public Offering
 
On October 2, 2020, we consummated our IPO of 46,000,000 units (the “units”), including 6,000,000 units purchased by the underwriters pursuant to the over-allotment option granted by the Company to the Underwriter. Each unit consists of one share Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“warrant”), with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $460,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 9,333,333 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to BLS Investor Group LLC (our “sponsor”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $14,000,000.
 
A total of $460,000,000, comprised of $450,800,000 of the proceeds from the IPO (which amount includes $16,100,000 of the underwriter’s deferred discount) and $9,200,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “trust account”) maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Brenton L. Saunders, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Dr. Manisha Narasimhan, our Chief Financial Officer and Director Nominee, who have many years of experience investing in ventures and building companies with operations. We must complete our initial business combination by October 2, 2022, 24 months from the closing of IPO. If our initial business combination is not consummated by October 2, 2022, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
On December 8, 2020, the Company, Hydrate Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub I”), Hydrate Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub II”), LCP Edge Intermediate, Inc., a Delaware corporation and indirect parent of Edge Systems LLC d/b/a The HydraFacial Company (“HydraFacial”), and LCP Edge Holdco, LLC (“LCP,” and, in its capacity as the stockholders’ representative, the “Stockholders’ Representative”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), which provides for, among other things: (i) the merger of Merger Sub I with and into HydraFacial, with HydraFacial continuing as the surviving corporation (the “First Merger”); and (ii) immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, the merger of HydraFacial with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving entity (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”). As a result of the Mergers, HydraFacial will be combined with Merger Sub II, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The transactions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the Mergers, will constitute a “Business Combination” as contemplated by the Company’s Amended & Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “current certificate of incorporation”).

The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) on December 8, 2020.
 
Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement and customary adjustments set forth therein, the aggregate merger consideration to be paid to HydraFacial’s stockholders in connection with the Business Combination is expected to be approximately $975,000,000 less HydraFacial’s net indebtedness as of the closing of the Business Combination, and subject to further adjustments for transaction expenses, and net working capital relative to a target. This merger consideration will include both cash consideration and consideration in the form of newly issued shares of our Class A Common stock. The cash consideration will be an amount equal to the Company’s cash and cash equivalents as of the closing of the Business Combination (including proceeds in connection with the Private Placement (as defined below)), minus HydraFacial’s outstanding indebtedness at the closing of the Business Combination, minus transaction expenses of HydraFacial and the Company, minus $100,000,000. However, cash consideration, together with certain contractual fees owed by HydraFacial to affiliates of its stockholders, will be subject to a maximum of 60% of the sum of the aggregate merger consideration plus these fees. The remainder of the merger consideration will be paid in a number of shares of our Class A Common Stock at a value of $10.00 per share. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company will pay off, or cause to be paid off, on behalf of HydraFacial, HydraFacial’s outstanding indebtedness under its existing credit facilities, and the merger consideration will be reduced by the amount of any such payment.
 
In addition to the consideration to be paid at the closing of the Business Combination, the stockholders of HydraFacial may be entitled to receive contingent consideration from the Company if certain acquisition targets identified by HydraFacial are acquired before or within one year after the closing of the Business Combination. This contingent consideration will be equal to 2.5 times the gross standalone revenue of each such acquisition target for the 12 months prior to such acquisition, up to a maximum of $75,000,000, and will be payable in shares of Class A Common Stock.
 
Concurrently with execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 35,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in a private placement for $10.00 per share (the “Private Placement”). The proceeds from the Private Placement will be used to partially fund the cash consideration to be paid to the stockholders of HydraFacial at the closing of the Business Combination.
 
The Business Combination also calls for additional agreements, including, among others, the Investor Rights Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, as described in the preliminary proxy statement initially filed by the Company with the SEC on December 31, 2020 (the “Preliminary Proxy Statement”), as amended on February 11, 2021.
 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
 
Members of our management team directly and indirectly own our common stock and/or private placement warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.

Each of our directors and officers will, directly or indirectly, own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following our IPO and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity or is subject to other contractual restrictions. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to such officer’s and director’s fiduciary duties under Delaware law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any business combination opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and it is an opportunity that we are able to complete on a reasonable basis.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting fees and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the Market Value of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
 
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 1819 West Avenue, Bay 2, Miami Beach, FL 33139 and our telephone number is (786) 216-7037. We pay BLS Advisors LLC, an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, a total of $10,000 per month for office space and administrative support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act, and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
