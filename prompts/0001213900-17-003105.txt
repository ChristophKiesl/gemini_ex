Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
FlexShopper, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “FlexShopper” or the “Company”) is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. We were incorporated on August 16, 2006 under the laws of the State of Delaware as BTHC XI, Inc. On April 4, 2007, we changed our corporate name to Anchor Funding Services, Inc. On October 16, 2013, we changed our corporate name to FlexShopper, Inc. FlexShopper owns 100% of FlexShopper, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of North Carolina on June 24, 2013. Since the sale of the assets of Anchor Funding Services LLC, which sale was completed in a series of transactions between April and June 2014, FlexShopper is a holding corporation with no operations except for those conducted by FlexShopper, LLC. FlexShopper, LLC owns two wholly-owned Delaware subsidiaries, FlexShopper 1, LLC and FlexShopper 2, LLC. All references to the business operations of FlexShopper refer to FlexShopper, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
Overview
 
Since June 2013, FlexShopper, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, FlexShopper, LLC, has been engaged in the business of providing certain types of durable goods to consumers on a lease-to-own basis and providing lease-to-own (“LTO”) terms to consumers of third party retailers and e-tailers. FlexShopper generated revenues from this new line of business since December 2013. Management believes that the introduction of FlexShopper's lease-to-own programs support broad untapped expansion opportunities within the U.S. consumer e-commerce and retail marketplaces. FlexShopper and its online LTO products provide consumers the ability to acquire durable goods, including electronics, computers and furniture, on an affordable payment, lease basis. Concurrently, FlexShopper’s model provides e-tailers and retailers an opportunity to increase their sales by utilizing FlexShopper's online channels to connect with consumers that want to acquire products on an LTO basis.
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND STRATEGIES
 
FlexShopper believes there is significant opportunity to expand the LTO industry online and into mainstream retail and e-tail. The LTO industry currently serves approximately six million consumers annually, generating approximately $10.0 billion in sales primarily through approximately 10,000 LTO brick and mortar stores. Through its strategic sales channels, FlexShopper believes it can expand the LTO industry, also known as the rent-to-own or RTO industry. FlexShopper has successfully developed and is currently processing LTO transactions using its proprietary technology that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits and entering into leases for durable goods generally within a few minutes. This technology is the basis for FlexShopper’s primary sales channels which provide consumers four distinct ways of obtaining brand name durable goods on an LTO basis: (1) at FlexShopper’s LTO e-commerce marketplace, www.flexshopper.com, where consumers can choose from over 80,000 different items including electronics, furniture, musical instruments, and equipment; (2) on third party e-commerce sites featuring FlexShopper’s LTO payment method, where consumers can activate FlexShopper’s payment button at checkout; (3) at FlexShopper’s automated kiosks located in certain retail locations; and (4) with the FlexShopper Wallet, a mobile application enabling consumers to get durable goods from major retailers with their smartphones.

FlexShopper launched its online LTO marketplace in March 2014 and FlexShopper launched its patent-pending LTO payment method in December 2014. Retailers and e-tailers that sell furniture, electronics, computers, appliances and other durable goods and partner with FlexShopper have three channels which provide an opportunity to increase their sales: (i) in the store, (ii) online and (iii) on our marketplace. FlexShopper aims to enable merchants to sell to more than 50 million consumers that do not have sufficient credit or cash to buy from them. In addition, FlexShopper pays the merchant 100% of the retail price. An excerpt of our marketing literature presented below depicts our offerings to retail merchants:

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
The lease-to-own industry offers customers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining electronics, computers, home furnishings and appliances. In a typical industry lease-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 to 24 months, normally by making weekly lease payments. The customers may cancel the agreement as prescribed in the lease agreement by returning the merchandise, generally with no further lease obligation if their account is current. If customers lease the item to the full term, they obtain ownership of the item, though they can choose to buy it at any time. FlexShopper’s current fixed term to acquire ownership is fifty-two weeks.
 
The lease-to-own concept is particularly popular with consumers who cannot pay the full purchase price for merchandise at once or who lack the credit to qualify under conventional financing programs. Lease-to-own is also popular with consumers who, despite good credit, do not wish to incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise or want to try out a particular brand or model before buying it.
 
We believe that there is significant market opportunity to expand the LTO market beyond traditional brick and mortar stores by creating an online presence through an LTO e-commerce site and payment method. We believe that the segment of the population targeted by the industry comprises more than 50 million people in the United States and the needs of these consumers are generally underserved.
 
UNDERWRITING PROCESS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
 
FlexShopper has developed a proprietary decision engine that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits on LTO products and entering into leases for durable goods generally within a few minutes. Included in this determination of a consumer’s spending limit are factors such as income, frequency that such consumer overdraws his or her bank account, fraud reports, repayment history and charge-off history. The Company obtains such consumer data from multiple third party sources which are monitored and analyzed by our risk department. We continually update our underwriting models to manage risk of default. Our decision engine also includes fraud tools and information from third party data sources to combat online fraud. We are continuously developing and implementing improvements to reduce losses related to fraudulent activity. In 2016, the Company enhanced its risk department by hiring a Chief Risk Officer. See Key Employees in Part III.
CUSTOMERS
 
FlexShopper’s customers typically do not have sufficient cash or credit to obtain durable goods. These consumers find the short-term nature and affordable payments of lease-to-own attractive. The lease-to-own industry serves a highly diverse customer base. According to the Association of Progressive Rental Organizations, approximately 74 percent of lease to-own customers have household incomes between $15,000 and $50,000 per year. We believe we can expand the LTO market beyond brick and mortar stores with our LTO e-commerce site and online payment method. These sales channels will enable us to serve and target more than 50 million people that we believe do not have sufficient cash or access to reasonable credit for durable goods.
SALES AND MARKETING
 
We promote our FlexShopper products and services through print and television advertisements, Internet sites and direct response marketing, all of which are designed to increase our lease transactions and name recognition. Our advertisements emphasize such features as instant spending limit and affordable weekly payments. We believe that as the FlexShopper name gains familiarity and national recognition through our advertising efforts, we will continue to educate our existing and potential customers about the lease-to-own payment alternative as well as solidify our reputation as a leading provider of high quality branded merchandise and services.

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 
FlexShopper uses computer-based management information systems to facilitate its entire business model, including underwriting, processing transactions through its sales channels, managing collections and monitoring leased inventory. Through the use of our proprietary software developed in-house, each of our retail partners uses our online merchant portal that automates the process of consumers receiving spending limits and entering into leases for durable goods generally within a few minutes. The management information system generates reports which enable us to meet our financial reporting requirements.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
 
The lease-to-own industry is regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, many of which are in place for consumer protection. In general such laws regulate, among other items, applications for leases, late fees, other finance rates, the form of disclosure statements, the substance and sequence of required disclosures, the content of advertising materials and certain collection procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws and regulations may result in penalties ranging from nominal amounts up to and including forfeiture of fees and other amounts due on leases. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations and earnings. In 2016, the Company enhanced its compliance department by hiring a Chief Compliance Counsel. See the section captioned “Risk Factors” below for more information with respect to governmental laws and regulations and their effect on our business.
COMPETITION
 
The lease-to-own industry is highly competitive. Our operation competes with other national, regional and local lease-to-own businesses, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Some of these companies have, or may develop, systems that enable consumers to obtain through online facilities spending limits and payment terms and to enter into leases nearly instantaneously, in a manner similar to that provided by FlexShopper’s proprietary technology. Many of our competitors have substantially more resources and greater experience in the lease-to-own business than FlexShopper. With respect to customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit, we also compete with retail stores. Competition is based primarily on store location, product selection and availability, customer service, and lease rates and terms. We believe that currently we do not have significant competition for our on-line LTO marketplace and patent pending LTO payment method, however, there is no assurance that other companies may not develop similar or competing concepts that could adversely impact the usage or value of our online LTO marketplace or our LTO payment method.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
FlexShopper has two non-provisional patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for systems that enable consumers to obtain products on an LTO basis using mobile devices and tablets and for a lease-to-own method of payment at check-out on e-commerce sites. We can provide no assurances that FlexShopper will be granted any patents by the USPTO. We regard our pending patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. In particular, we believe certain proprietary information, including but not limited to our underwriting model, and patent pending systems are central to our business model and we believe give us a key competitive advantage. We also rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and work product agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. See the section captioned “Risk Factors” below for more information on and risk associated with respect to our intellectual property.
