Item 1. Business 
Overview 
Our mission is to help humanity thrive by enabling the world’s teams to work together effortlessly. 
Asana is a work management platform that helps teams orchestrate work, from daily tasks to cross-functional strategic initiatives. Over 93,000 paying customers use Asana to manage everything from product launches to marketing campaigns to organization-wide goal setting. Our platform adds structure to unstructured work, creating clarity, transparency, and accountability to everyone within an organization—individuals, team leads, and executives—so they understand exactly who is doing what, by when. 
History 
We started Asana because our co-founders experienced firsthand the growing problem of work about work. While at Facebook, they saw the coordination challenges the company faced as it scaled. Instead of spending time on work that generated results, they were spending time in status meetings and long email threads trying to figure out who was responsible for what. They recognized the pain of work about work was universal to teams that need to coordinate their work effectively to achieve their objectives. Yet there were no products in the market that adequately addressed this pain. As a result of that frustration, they were inspired to create Asana to solve this problem for the world’s teams. 
Since our inception, over 30 million users have registered on Asana and millions of teams in virtually every country around the world have used Asana. With Asana, users experience higher productivity, which has led to rapid adoption across teams, departments, and organizations. As of January 31, 2021, we had over 1.5 million paid users. 
Teams Spend Too Much Time on Work About Work 
Work continues to get harder to manage as organizations try to move faster to accomplish ambitious goals and respond to changing market demands. Today, 60% of knowledge workers’ time is spent on work about work. Moreover, coordinating work within and across teams is chaotic. Without a system of record, teams move slowly, miss deadlines, and fail to live up to their full potential. At work, people face an overwhelming volume of communications from email and messaging applications, many of which are asking for status updates. These messages often provide limited clarity around what steps need to be taken, and by when, and limited accountability around who owns the action. As a result, requests go unanswered, and employees spend more time searching and responding to messages in an attempt to provide clarity and accountability to their teams. These emails and messages only give teams momentary clarity about specific deliverables or actions, and as such they do not provide a holistic, persistent, and referenceable plan of record that can be easily or quickly accessed. 
To minimize work about work, reduce chaos, and give individuals time back to focus on the work that matters, teams need a purpose-built solution for coordination. Despite the growth in collaboration technology such as content tools and messaging apps, there has been little innovation in work management—systems that help teams to plan, manage, and execute their work.
How Asana Helps Teams 
Asana is a system of record for work. This system collects and structures institutional knowledge about how past work was completed and provides a real-time plan and roadmap for current and future initiatives. Our platform is built on our proprietary, multi-dimensional data model, which we call the Asana Work Graph data model. The Asana Work Graph captures and associates: 
•units of work—tasks, projects, milestones, portfolios, and goals; 
•the people responsible for executing those units of work; 
•the processes in which work gets done—rules and templates; 
•information about that work—files, comments, status, and metadata; and 
•relationships across and within this data. 
Our data model provides individuals, team leads, and executives with dynamic views into the work that is most relevant to them—across multiple people and projects—all based on the same underlying data in the Asana Work Graph. Individuals can manage and prioritize their daily tasks and collaborate with team members on shared projects, gaining visibility into who is doing what, and when each piece of work is due. Team leads can plan work and optimize team workload across multiple projects, and executives can track progress towards company objectives in real time. 
Asana is flexible and applicable to virtually any use case across departments and organizations of all sizes. We designed our platform to be easy to use and intuitive to all users, regardless of role or technical proficiency. Users can start a project within minutes and onboard team members seamlessly without external support. We allow users to work the way they want with the interface that is right for them, using tasks, lists, calendars, boards, timelines, reporting dashboards, and Workload. 
Our Business Model 
Our hybrid self-service and direct sales model allows us to efficiently reach teams everywhere and then rapidly expand the use of our platform within their organizations. A majority of our paying customers initially adopt our platform through self-service and free trials. Once adopted, customers can expand through self-service or with the assistance of our direct sales team, which is focused on promoting new use cases of Asana. As customers realize the productivity benefits we provide, our platform often becomes critical to managing their work and achieving their objectives, which drives further adoption and expansion opportunities. This is evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rate, which generally increases with greater organizational spend. As of January 31, 2021, our dollar-based net retention rate within organizations spending $5,000 or more with us on an annualized basis was 125%, consisting of 10,174 customers. Our dollar-based net retention rate within organizations spending $50,000 or more with us on an annualized basis was over 140%, consisting of 397 customers.
Our Company Culture 
We believe that our company culture enables us to achieve our mission and is a core driver of our business success. We endeavor to make product, business, and people decisions that allow us to carry out our mission while staying true to our values. We are a mission-driven organization first and have designed our values, along with our programs and processes, to help us maximize the potential of every individual in our company. Our values and processes also give us credibility when we share best practices for teamwork in the market and allow us to build those practices into our solution. 
Industry Background 
Teams must be coordinated and move quickly to be successful 
Teams today must navigate work that is increasingly cross-functional, matrixed, and distributed, while also moving quickly to meet the objectives of their organizations. With product lifecycles now shorter than ever, organizations cannot afford to be slowed down by inefficient processes. Individuals and teams need to be empowered to make autonomous decisions aligned with organizational goals to ensure business agility in rapidly changing markets. 
Communication overload hurts productivity 
Businesses have adopted a number of applications to improve communication such as Skype, WeChat, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, and Slack, among others. While these applications help teams communicate, they were not designed to provide a system of record to track and coordinate units of work or set up processes for rapid execution. The average knowledge worker receives 121 emails per day—70% of which are opened within six 
seconds. People have become prisoners to email and messaging applications, using their inboxes as makeshift to-do lists. 
Teams spend more time coordinating work than actually doing work 
Productivity gains can occur when individuals and teams have the opportunity to focus uninterrupted. However, employees spend less than half of their time during the day on the work that is critical to generating results. According to a survey conducted by McKinsey Global Institute of a broad set of knowledge workers: 
•28% of time is spent answering email; 
•19% of time is spent gathering information; and 
•14% of time is spent on internal communication. 
Teams need more effective tools to orchestrate work 
The primary methods for managing work today—across any department, any sized team, and any project—consist of a combination of spreadsheets and email, in addition to handwritten notes, calls, and meetings. Over time, communication tools (like email and messaging) and content applications (such as file sharing and storage services) have been repurposed for coordinating work because they are familiar and accessible. However, these tools lack the purpose-built functionality required for teams to collaboratively plan, manage, and execute work. 
Clarity drives employee engagement that improves business results 
Employee engagement—the extent to which employees are invested in their job and contribute the effort needed to do their job well—is critical to high-performing businesses. Individuals are more engaged at work when they have clarity. Clarity helps individuals better understand how their work connects to the organization’s objectives so they know where to focus their energy for maximum impact and find their work more rewarding and engaging.
Organizations need new, purpose-built solutions for work management 
Organizations need a work management solution that provides transparency, clarity, and accountability so that individuals and teams know—at any given time—what work needs to get done, by whom and by when. This solution needs to allow organizations to set goals and manage all the underlying portfolios, projects, and tasks needed to achieve them. The solution also needs to scale across every level of the organization so individuals, team leads, and executives can understand and take actions to move work forward in real time. 
Our Solution 
We provide a work management platform that enables individuals and teams to get work done faster while improving employee engagement by allowing everyone to see how their work—whether it is a task, process, project, objectives and key results (OKR), or portfolio of projects—connects to the broader mission of an organization. 
With Asana:
•Individuals can manage and prioritize across each of their projects to maximize their effectiveness and reduce distractions. They can see their own tasks, how their dependencies owned by teammates are tracking, and how their work contributes to the overall team and organization-wide goals. Individuals can collaborate with teammates and have visibility into each team member’s responsibilities and progress. When teammates operate off a single, real-time plan of record, they do not need to check in with each other for updates or sit through status meetings. This clarity reduces work about work and helps individuals get work done faster. 
•Team leads can manage work across a portfolio of projects or processes. Team leads see progress, bottlenecks, resource constraints, and milestones without having to create work for teams to come up with this information in spreadsheets, email, or via a status meeting. When surprises or disruptions occur, it is easy for team leads to adjust the plan, reallocate resources, and communicate updates in real time. 
•Executives can communicate company-wide goals, monitor status, and oversee work across projects to gain real-time insights into which initiatives are on track or at risk. With this visibility, they can proactively ensure alignment, address inefficiencies, manage team workload, and reallocate work among teams or departments so that the company can stay on track to achieve its objectives. 
As the system of record of past, current, and future work, Asana is powered by a proprietary, multi-dimensional data model called the Asana Work Graph. The Asana Work Graph captures and associates units of work (tasks, projects, milestones, goals, and portfolios), the people responsible for executing those units of work, the processes in which work gets done (rules and templates), information about that work (files, comments, status, and metadata), and the relationships across and within this data. The Asana Work Graph provides individuals, team leads, and executives with dynamic, up-to-date views into the work that is most relevant to them, across multiple people and projects. 
The core tenet of our platform is to bring clarity, transparency, and accountability to the process of getting work done. 
Clarity. Our platform adds structure to unstructured work so everyone on a team has clarity into exactly what needs to be done, by whom and by when. Our multi-dimensional data model provides different views so individuals can not only see the tasks they are working on, but also understand how their individual work contributes to a broader project goal. 
Transparency. Our platform provides transparency into the work being done across a project or portfolio of projects so everyone can see progress to completion, manage deadlines, identify and resolve bottlenecks, and rebalance workloads in real time. 
Accountability. Our platform enables teams to assign work to individuals with completion dates and requirements, eliminating ambiguity over responsibilities. Individuals can track their action items across projects and manage their time more effectively. 
Benefits of Our Solution 
Our platform provides the following benefits for our customers: 
Teams get work done faster 
Teams get work done faster using Asana. When structure is added to work, creating greater clarity, transparency, and accountability, teams are able to take action and be more efficient—regardless of whether their team members are in the office or working remotely.
Streamlined processes 
Our horizontal application allows individuals to easily customize projects across a breadth of specific use cases. Once a process is defined, it can be templatized and scaled across an organization for consistent, repeatable process management. In October 2019, we launched Rules as part of our suite of automation features, which facilitates auto-assignment, triggers actions and notifications, and automatically populates due dates for templated projects. Since launching Rules, we have automated over 52 million steps for our users. 
Increased employee engagement 
Our users love Asana because they gain clarity into what they need to do and how their contribution is connected to broader organizational goals. This clarity is particularly important for distributed teams and remote employees. By eliminating much of the work about work, we give them back valuable hours in their day to focus on the work that matters, leading to higher productivity, higher engagement, and improved retention. 
Improved confidence and execution 
Using Asana, individuals reduce their anxiety about missing deadlines and having work fall through the cracks. As a system of record for work, Asana stores all task and project information on past and present initiatives so people have greater confidence in meeting deliverables. Individuals, team leads, and executives gain real-time visibility into all the work that is happening in their organization, enabling them to feel organized and in control. 
Improved business continuity for distributed teams and remote work 
Asana gives teams the clarity they need to stay organized and productive wherever they are. Distributed and remote teams can use Asana as a single, real-time plan of record, reducing the need for messaging threads and video calls to coordinate work. Asana is a secure, cloud-based service that is accessible via internet browsers and a mobile application so that team members can manage their work from home, office, cafe, or other workspace. 
Our Culture
Our company culture is a core driver of our business success and enables us to work towards achieving our mission. A core tenet of our culture is a shared commitment to mindfulness, which informs our product, business, and people decisions and shapes how we interact with each other daily. By investing in diversity and inclusion programs, we help ensure that everyone can thrive and feel a sense of belonging, enabling us to better understand the needs of our diverse customer base and innovate in new and creative ways. We also use Asana ourselves, providing our employees with clarity into how their work contributes to our mission and enabling them to do their most impactful work. 
On Glassdoor, we have a 4.9 out of 5.0 score, a 100% CEO approval rating, and a 99% "Recommend to a Friend" rating. In 2020, Great Place to Work and FORTUNE named us as a #1 workplace three times: #1 Best Workplaces in Technology (Small and Medium), #1 Best Workplaces for Millennials (Small and Medium), and the fourth consecutive year as #1 Best Workplace in the Bay Area (Small and Medium); as well as #2 Best Small & Medium Workplaces and #8 Best Workplaces for Women. We were also named a Great Place to Work Best 
Workplace for Parents, #7 Ireland's Best Workplaces (Small), #14 on Glassdoor's Best Places to Work 2021, and an Inc. Best Workplaces for the third consecutive year. 
Features of our Platform
Asana is a single unified platform that provides clarity at every level of an organization for individuals, team leads, and executives. Powered by a proprietary, multi-dimensional data model called the Asana Work Graph, which captures and associates units of work, Asana provides dynamic views—List, Calendar, Board, Timeline, Portfolio, Reports—so that individuals can see work data in whatever way makes most sense to them. Any changes made to underlying data through one view is automatically updated in real time to all other views. 
Asana Work Graph Hierarchy 
The Asana Work Graph represents units of work—tasks, projects, portfolios, and goals—to enable a complete, connected, and up-to-date map of work in an organization. Unlike other work management solutions, Asana powers clarity at every level of an organization, regardless of size, structure, and complexity. The Asana Work Graph provides:
•Individuals with dynamic views into the work that is most relevant to them, accelerating adoption and maximizing personal productivity. 
•Teams with the ability to view and modify the same work data across different views so they can coordinate complex, cross-team work with ease. 
•Executives with visibility into how daily work connects to higher-level goals and initiatives so they can understand real-time progress. 
Tasks
Tasks are the atomic unit of work within the Asana Work Graph. Within tasks, users can assign owners, set due dates and times, attach documents, and define custom fields for information about the task so that everyone knows who is doing what by when and has the information needed to complete the work. Custom fields are metadata that help users plan, sort, and organize work. Collaboration including comments, sharing, @-mentions, and image markup are natively built into tasks, ensuring that relevant updates and context stay with the work at hand. Changes in task information made in one view are automatically updated across all views where the task is visible so that users don’t have to re-enter information.
Projects
A project consists of a set of tasks, which can be organized into sections and arranged into dependencies that give teams clarity on plan and process. Projects can be used to accomplish a specific goal, such as delivering a presentation or campaign, or can be used to intake and process requests, such as a help desk or creative production. If the project is a workflow the team normally follows, it can be converted into a template, making it easy to set up a repeatable workflow so that teams do not have to start from scratch or miss any steps.
Portfolios
Portfolio lets users organize projects into one centralized location, acting as the mission control so that team leads and executives have real-time visibility into how work is progressing across projects. Users can add or remove projects, check the status and progress of each project, view priorities, and assign relevant project owners. Individuals can click on any project to see a full summary overview of the project with the ability to edit due dates, view key milestones, link to the tasks and resources available, check or add status updates, and add comments for the team. They can also see all projects within the Portfolio on a Timeline to get a bird’s-eye view of when initiatives are kicking off and when they will be completed. Like many of the views in Asana, the layout of Portfolio can be customized based on individual preference. Portfolios can be made public or private, or can be shared only with specific individuals.
Goals
Goals gives users a centralized place to set goals and track the work needed to achieve them. Goals is a flexible system that supports OKR and other goal management methodologies. Users can set and view goals at the organization or team level and can create goal hierarchies to drive alignment across teams. Goals are connected to the underlying work (Portfolios, Projects, and Tasks) needed to achieve them, giving executives and team leads a single system to set goals and track progress. Goals can be made visible to the entire organization so all team members have clarity on the company’s priorities and see how their work contributes to the organization’s success.
Dynamic Views
My Tasks 
My Tasks provides a single, clear view of every deliverable and due date assigned to individuals so that they start their day knowing exactly what they need to do, by when. Items can be organized and dragged and dropped into different categories so that individuals can prioritize their part of a project or any process-related tasks. 
All individuals have their own My Tasks. Team members can view other team members’ tasks to see what they are working on. Individuals also have the option to create private tasks, which are only visible to themselves and the people they have explicitly added as collaborators.
Inbox
Inbox is the notification center for Asana. It displays updates on all projects that individuals are a member of and tasks that they follow or are assigned so that they can stay on top of the work that matters. Task and project updates—such as when a task is marked complete, a comment is added, or the status of a project is updated—
triggers a notification that appears in the Inbox of anyone who follows the task or belongs to the project. Individuals can filter their Inbox based on assigned tasks and @-mentions so they can focus on their top priorities.
List View
The List view of a project lets individuals sort, organize into sections, and filter a list of tasks. Tasks can be dragged and dropped, and filtered and sorted according to what matters most so project teams can see all the work needed to complete a project and easily drill down into details. Keyboard shortcuts can be used to move tasks up or down the list, and a project toolbar allows users to adjust their project view.
Calendar View
Calendar view displays tasks within the project on a calendar based on due date and, optionally, start and end dates, so that individuals can see how many tasks are due within a time period and stay on top of their deadlines. Individuals can contribute tasks to a team calendar, plan their work on a schedule, and then easily drag and drop tasks to make adjustments. Individuals can see their personal task list, all the tasks within a specific project, as well as all tasks across projects relevant to a team on a calendar. 
Board View
Boards provide individuals with a kanban-style display. Individuals use boards to plan and organize their work as if they were organizing sticky notes in columns on a wall so that they can quickly visualize the current stage of each task within a workstream. Tasks in the project are represented as cards within the columns and individuals commonly use the columns to represent stages in a workflow. As a task makes its way through the workflow, it moves from the left to the right. The tasks display due dates, assignee, custom fields, and previews of the latest attached files.
Boards can be customized to what matters most to the user, with the ability to add custom fields, filter, and sort by task, assignee, or due date. Additionally, tasks appearing in one board can be added to other projects so that work stays connected and up to date across initiatives without team members having to re-enter information.
Timeline View
Timeline allows teams to create and visualize project plans over time so that individuals can identify bottlenecks and task dependencies and make real-time adjustments as needed. Our Timeline view is more powerful than a static Gantt chart because it is connected to the underlying work and updates dynamically as work progresses. When a deadline shifts, all subsequent deadlines can shift accordingly. Timeline helps ensure work stays on track and all team members have clear visibility over the steps involved and progress towards the end goal.
Timeline is particularly relevant for time-bounded initiatives which have timing and sequencing dependencies. Timeline gives executives and project stakeholders an at-a-glance view of project plans and progress.
Workload
Workload visualizes the work, capacity, and trendline of each team member so that team leads have accurate and up-to-date information into the workload of their team members. The trendline is generated by number of tasks or numerical custom field values such as estimated hours or effort. Team leads can set capacity and be notified when team members are overloaded. Individuals can reallocate work from one team member to another with a drag-and-drop interface. 
Dashboards
Dashboards help customers visualize and communicate their team’s work in more meaningful ways. Dashboards provides customizable charts that auto-populate with real-time work insights like how many tasks have been completed and who on the team is overloaded – all with no coding or search queries required.
Automated Workflows
Processes
A process, or workflow, is the sequence of stages a piece of work passes through from initiation to completion. Asana provides pre-made templates for common processes around ongoing work within marketing, design, operations, sales, HR, product, engineering, and IT functions so that individuals and teams have a starting point for planning, managing, and executing their work.
Teams have the ability to create and save custom templates so that they can standardize and provide clarity on all the necessary steps of their unique workflows. Additionally, teams can implement rules to automate repetitive, manual tasks in a workflow, such as auto-assigning a task based on custom field status or moving a task from one column to another in Board view.
Rules
Rules help automate tedious and repetitive tasks so that teams can reduce manual work and spend more time on the work that matters. Individuals can select from suggested pre-built rules from the rules gallery or they can create a custom rule. A rule consists of one or more triggers and actions, enabling an individual to create logic and multiple actions around business scenarios. Actions in third-party applications that are integrated with Asana, such as Outlook, Gmail, and Slack, can also trigger rules, making it easy to automate manual work across applications.
Reporting
Asana provides reporting capabilities that automate and simplify the process of creating status reports and give individuals and teams a searchable history of their work data. Advanced Search allows individuals to specify search parameters to find data and conversations quickly and easily. The Asana Work Graph enables users to find work based on various attributes, including who is involved, what projects a task may belong to, and even the status of dependencies. Search criteria can be saved as reports, and results can be viewed in a list or calendar.
Integrations
The Asana platform integrates with over 100 third-party applications including:
•Microsoft apps such as Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, Power Automate, and Power Bi;
•G-suite apps such as Gmail, Calendar, Chrome, Sheets, and Drive;
•Functional tools such as Salesforce and Adobe Creative Cloud;
•Communication apps such as Slack and Zoom;
•File sharing apps such as Box and Dropbox;
•Development apps such as GitHub and Jira; and
•Reporting apps such as Tableau.
Integrations connect applications to Asana, which provides a central hub for managing work. Teams save time by eliminating the need to switch between various sites and tools. By providing this centralized hub, Asana ensures that work in other tools is tracked and completed. 
Integrations with third-party applications are achieved through Asana Connect without sharing any usernames or passwords. Asana Connect enables seamless integration with third-party applications and gives users the ability to 
manage all of their work streams through a single platform. Asana Connect uses OAuth 2.0, an industry standard for authentication. 
Our Technology
The architecture we have built to power Asana is secure and scalable, offering users a customized experience that is easy to navigate while handling complex data management behind the scenes. We designed our systems to allow flexible access to the Asana Work Graph, allowing us to build rich new functionality quickly and innovate in the work management space.
Extensible, Efficient Technology Platform
Our cloud-native platform includes proprietary software services built on top of infrastructure provided by our preferred cloud provider Amazon Web Services. We shard customer data in our distributed datastore to scale horizontally and provide high performance, and redundancy across multiple third-party data centers in several locations in the United States and Europe to protect against data loss and provide high availability. The distributed datastore allows flexible indexing across single or multiple attributes of the objects stored in it, thus efficiently supporting a wide variety of queries. Our platform services keep track of connected devices and data requests, automatically sending updates to devices as data is updated. This allows our client software to surface real-time information with minimal data transfer and round-trips to the servers, and provides a fast, responsive experience to our customers.
We provide our software as a service to customers, so the technology we build includes deployment tools to ensure we can publish software updates rapidly and safely, as well as monitoring and automation tools.
Commitment to Security and Privacy
Upholding the trust that we have established with our customers and gaining the trust of new customers remains a priority for us and as a result, we have implemented robust safeguards to protect the security of customer data. Our security program includes conducting risk assessments of all systems and networks that process customer data; monitoring for security events; maintaining incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans that explicitly address and provide guidance to our personnel in furtherance of the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data; and having a qualified third party perform security assessments on a periodic basis to test against widely recognized security standards and practices. 
Our security program is aligned to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, and Confidentiality as well as the ISO 27001:2013 standards. We issue a SOC 2 Type II report on an annual basis and are certified against ISO 27001:2013. This means that independent third parties have both validated our processes and practices with respect to these standards, and confirmed our ability to maintain compliance with controls we have implemented. 
We have built our platform with security features that are designed to be scalable as we develop and introduce new functionality, including but not limited to supporting encryption of user data in transit and at rest within our platform, and implementing strong access controls and multi-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access to customer data. Additionally, our platform allows customers to implement their own granular access controls by giving them the ability to restrict access on a per task, per project and per team basis. 
In addition to security, we are deeply committed to privacy and to protecting and honoring the privacy rights of our customers. We have established a comprehensive privacy compliance program, aligning our practices with regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, including by delivering periodic training to our employees on privacy best practices, reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share, and creating a customer rights program and response process to honor the requests of our customers exercising their privacy rights. Above all, we strive to be transparent about our privacy practices, independent of legal obligations.
Our Customers
We have customers of all sizes ranging from individuals to global organizations. We define a customer as a distinct account, which could include a team, company, educational or government institution, organization, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a paid subscription plan, a free version, or a free trial of one of our paid subscription plans. A single organization may have multiple customers. We define a paying customer as a customer on a paid subscription plan. As of January 31, 2021, we had over 93,000 paying customers globally, representing an increase of over 18,000 paying customers from January 31, 2020 and an increase of approximately 35,000 from January 31, 2019. Of those paying customers, 10,174 spent $5,000 or more with us on an annualized basis, representing an increase of 3,619 paying customers from January 31, 2020. Additionally, 397 of those paying customers spent $50,000 or more with us on an annualized basis, representing an increase of 190 paying customers from January 31, 2020. As of January 31, 2020, we had over 75,000 paying customers globally. Of those paying customers, 207 spent $50,000 or more with us on an annualized basis, representing an increase of 148 paying customers from January 31, 2019.
Our current customer base spans numerous industry categories, including technology, retail, education, non-profit, government, healthcare, media, and financial services, and includes many category leaders across these diverse industries. No individual customer represented more than 1% of our revenues in the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. 
Sales and Marketing
We employ a hybrid go-to-market approach, combining a self-service model with direct sales efforts. We are focused on landing teams worldwide and expanding across use cases, both within and between organizations, to ensure the success of our customers. This in turn creates positive word-of-mouth marketing, driving adoption, expansion and ultimately our business results.
Self-Service Model
A majority of our paying customers initially adopt our platform through self-service and free trials. To demonstrate the value of our platform to potential paying customers, we provide free trials of our paid Asana Premium and Business offerings in addition to our free Basic offering for teams of up to 15 people. As individuals, teams and their guests realize the productivity benefits we provide, Asana becomes an increasingly integral part of their day-to-day work and critical to helping them achieve their objectives.
Direct Sales
In conjunction with our self-service model, we have a targeted direct sales team focused on promoting new use cases and expanding our footprint within our existing customer base. Our direct sales force has a global presence, and consists primarily of sales teams focused primarily on strategic accounts with expansion opportunities including department-specific and organization-wide use cases such as employee onboarding and goal setting. 
Marketing and Customer Success
We market our platform through owned properties, such as our website and social media channels, media coverage, paid acquisition, and word of mouth to promote discovery and adoption. Every month millions of people visit asana.com, and hundreds of thousands of people register for the product. Our customers also have the ability to invite external parties to collaborate on specific Asana projects, which supports viral adoption of our platform.
We offer on-demand education available in-product and online, and via live learning courses as well as robust customer support available in six languages. We also offer our customers the option to partner with a list of managed service providers, consulting firms, and system integrators to help customize their account, onboard teams and run onsite training.
Our global community of customers and experts, Asana Together, connects customers, both online and offline, and creates champions. Through Asana Together, customers have access to our community Forum to ask questions and connect with peers. We also certify and support Asana Ambassadors (go-to enthusiasts who assist with and 
promote adoption within their networks) and Certified Pros (independent third-party Asana consultants who offer their services for a discretionary fee to help teams make the most of their experience on our platform). Through Asana Together, we have hosted multiple in-person events on five different continents.
Effects of Inflation
We believe inflation in the regions where most of our sales occur has not had a significant effect on our net revenues or profitability.
Research and Development
Key to our success is the time, attention and investment we place on continued innovation in our platform. We will continue to invest in expanding our product offerings and enhancing the features and functionality of our platform, particularly in the areas of integrations, automation, functional workflows, security, and organization-wide use cases. We leverage the breadth of our customer base, and the diverse ways in which they use our platform, to recognize their needs quickly and guide future innovation. Further, we ourselves are users—all of our employees are committed to using Asana internally, every single day—ensuring our entire organization is in touch with the platform’s capabilities and can rapidly identify or suggest improvements. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of solutions for our platform. 
Our Competition
The market for work management platforms is increasingly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapidly changing technology, shifting user and customer needs, new market entrants, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We compete with companies that range in size, from large and diversified with significant spending resources to smaller companies. The work management solutions market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry, and in the future there will likely be an increasing number of similar solutions offered by additional competitors. Our competition addresses the project management and work management categories, including, but not limited to, solutions around email, messaging, and spreadsheets. Our competitors fall into the following groups: companies specifically offering work management solutions; companies offering productivity suites; and companies specializing in vertical solutions.
We believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:
•adaptability to a broad range of use cases;
•features and functionality of platform capabilities;
•developments and enhancements of work management solutions;
•customer service and support efforts;
•efficient hybrid go-to-market model;
•ease of use, performance, price, and reliability of solutions;
•scalability and security;
•brand strength; and
•ability to create easy to use integrations for, and robust, effective partnerships with, other larger enterprise software solutions and tools.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements, licenses, and intellectual property assignment agreements. We maintain a policy 
requiring our employees, contractors, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements to control access to our proprietary information. These laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we therefore may be unable to protect our proprietary technology in certain jurisdictions. Moreover, our platform incorporates software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our platform. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify, and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. 
As of January 31, 2021, we had been granted 13 U.S. patents, had 33 U.S. patent applications pending, and five notices of allowance. Our issued patents expire between January 2031 and November 2040. We have not applied for patents in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. 
Government Regulation 
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”
Human Capital Management
As of January 31, 2021, we had 1,080 employees, representing growth of 54% since January 31, 2020.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive cash compensation, opportunities for equity ownership at all levels of the organization, development programs that enable continued learning and growth (including access to 1:1 coaching for every employee) and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement savings vehicles, and paid time off. Our compensation programs are designed to align employee interests’ with the long-term success of the company and to foster cross-business collaboration. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we invest in ongoing leadership development through programs such as our Conscious Leadership training program and Outstanding Manager Bootcamp curriculum. In addition, we regularly conduct an employee survey to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of focus.
As a global company, we are steadfast in our commitment to diversity and inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds.
