History and Development of the Company
Criteo S.A. was initially incorporated as a société par actions simplifiée, or S.A.S., under the laws of the French Republic on November 3, 2005, for a period of 99 years and subsequently converted to a société anonyme, or S.A. We are registered at the Paris Commerce and Companies Register under the number 484 786 249. Our agent for service of process in the United States is National Registered Agents, Inc. We began selling our solution in France in 2007 and expanded our business into other countries in Western Europe. In 2009, we expanded our business into North America and entered the Asia-Pacific region in late 2010. In November 2016, we acquired HookLogic, Inc. ("HookLogic"), a New York-based company that has developed a performance marketing exchange connecting consumer brand manufacturers with retail ecommerce sites via sponsored product ads sold by ecommerce retailers. We now offer HookLogic's products under the "Criteo Sponsored Products" name. Please refer to Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further details.
Business Overview 
We are a global technology company specializing in digital performance marketing. We strive to deliver post-click sales at scale to advertisers across multiple digital marketing channels and according to the client's targeted return on investment. We use our proprietary machine-learning algorithms, coupled with large volumes of granular shopping intent data and deep insights into consumer intent and purchasing habits, to price and deliver in real time highly relevant and personalized digital performance advertisements to consumers. By measuring the value we deliver on a post-click sales basis, we make the return on investment transparent and easy to measure for our advertiser clients.
We partner with our clients to capture activity on their digital properties, which we define as websites and/or mobile applications, and optimize the performance of their advertisements based on that activity and other data. Demonstrating the depth and scale of our data, we collected data on over $550 billion in sales transactions1 on our clients' digital properties in the year ended December 31, 2016, whether or not a consumer saw or clicked on an advertisement displayed by Criteo. Based on this data and our other assets, we delivered targeted advertisements that generated approximately 7.4 billion clicks1 in the year ended December 31, 2016. Based on these clicks, our clients generated approximately $25 billion in post-click sales1 during this period. A post-click sale is defined as a purchase made by a user from one of our clients' digital properties within a certain period of time following the user clicking on an advertisement we delivered for that client. This period of time varies by client, but is a maximum of 30 days. We believe post-click sales is a key performance indicator that our clients use to measure the effectiveness of our solution in driving sales and the return on their marketing spend with us. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 14,000 clients and in each of the last three years our average client retention rate, as measured on a quarterly basis, was approximately 90%.
Every day we are presented with billions of opportunities to connect individuals with relevant marketing messages from our clients. For each of these opportunities, our algorithms analyze massive volumes of data to observe and predict user intent and deliver specific messaging for products or services that are likely to engage that particular user and result in a sale for our client. The accuracy of our algorithms improves with every advertisement we deliver, as they incorporate new data, while continuing to learn from previous data.

Our performance marketing product portfolio is currently comprised of three products: Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, Criteo Predictive Search and Criteo Sponsored Products. Our core technology in the Criteo Engine is comprised of four key components: Universal Match, Product Recommendations, Predictive Bidding and Kinetic Design.

• | Criteo Dynamic Retargeting provides performance marketing to advertisers by pricing and delivering personalized advertisements in real time to consumers on display inventory, including on social and native inventory.


• | Criteo Predictive Search provides performance marketing to retailer advertisers by pricing personalized product advertisements on the shopping pages of the Google search engine in real time, for which users or consumers have expressed explicit intent by entering a search query.


• | Criteo Sponsored Products provides performance marketing to brand manufacturers by pricing and delivering in real time sponsored product advertisements to consumers on ecommerce retailers' websites.

Our technology enables real-time digital performance marketing in four key steps:4

• | First, we capture the shopping intent of individuals, whom we refer to as consumers or users, directly from the online stores and product catalogs of our clients' digital properties, to feed our technology platform.


• | Second, our proprietary technology sequentially performs the following critical steps:


▪ | Matches the device identifier of that user across several devices potentially used by that user;


▪ | Recommends the right product or service to offer to that user, based on the shopping intent data collected for that user and other statistically relevant data points;


▪ | Predicts the individual value of that user for the advertiser client, whose product or service is on offer in the advertisement, in order to bid the appropriate price for the advertising inventory on which our advertisement will be displayed; and


▪ | Creates a customized advertisement using optimized creative elements in line with the advertiser's branding guidelines.


• | Third, we deliver the personalized advertisement to the user across a wide range of inventory available to us through customized technical integrations and ad serving capabilities with publisher partners.


• | Fourth, we measure in real time the success of the advertisement and provide this performance information to our advertiser clients.

The entire process leading up to user engagement can be executed in under 100 milliseconds and, throughout the process, our technology monitors and adjusts each of these steps through a real-time feedback loop in order to optimize performance at all times. 
Our solution is comprised of the Criteo Engine, our data assets, access to publisher inventory, and our advertiser and publisher platforms. The Criteo Engine has been developed over the past 11 years and consists of multiple machine learning algorithms – in particular our product recommendation, user prediction/predictive bidding and creative algorithms – and the proprietary global hardware and software infrastructure that enables our solution to operate in real time and at significant scale.

Our solution covers the entire consumer journey and works seamlessly across digital devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets), digital environments (web and mobile applications), platforms (Google's Android, Apple's iOS and other operating systems), marketing channels (display, including social and native, search, and sponsored products advertisements on ecommerce retailers' sites) and publisher ecosystems (Google, Facebook and thousands of publishers in the open web).
Access to high quality data assets fuels the accuracy of our algorithms. We obtain large volumes of expressed consumer purchase intent, browsing behavior and transaction data through integration with substantially all of our clients, which enables us to track users' interactions with our clients' digital properties at the individual product level. These data assets include: our clients' sensitive and proprietary data, such as transaction activity on their digital properties; publisher-specific data, such as the performance of advertisements we previously delivered; as well as internally developed data that includes the vast knowledge we have extracted from having delivered and measured responses to over 3.4 trillion advertising impressions since inception. 
We believe this deep access to highly granular information demonstrates the trust that our clients place in us. For example, for most of our clients, we typically have real-time access to the products or services a customer has viewed, researched or bought from them and we continuously receive updated information on more than 4 billion products or services, including pricing, images and descriptions. The combination of these data sets gives us powerful insights into consumer purchasing habits that we use to price inventory and create the most relevant advertisements to drive user engagement and ultimately drive sales for our clients.
We also benefit from broad access to inventory through our direct relationships with thousands of publisher partners, including a leading presence on real-time-bidding display advertising exchanges. We define inventory as the combination of display advertising impressions, including social and native display inventory, shopping campaigns inventory on Google and inventory for sponsored products advertisements on major ecommerce retailers' sites. We believe that many of our direct publisher partners have granted us preferred access to portions of their inventory as a result of our ability to effectively monetize that inventory. This access enables us to select, buy and price inventory on an impression-by-impression basis that a publisher might otherwise only sell subject to minimum volume commitments. In addition, in some instances, we get exclusive or priority access to inventory before a publisher makes that inventory available to others. In the specific case of Criteo Predictive Search, we do not purchase search inventory ourselves; our advertiser clients have direct access to Google Shopping inventory, and we optimize the bidding strategy for such inventory on behalf of these clients to maximize the sales generated by their shopping campaigns.
The accuracy and efficiency of the Criteo Engine enables us to charge our clients only when users engage with an advertisement we deliver, usually by clicking on it. In contrast, traditional display solutions typically charge clients when an advertisement is displayed, whether or not the advertisement is seen or clicked on. In the specific case of Criteo Predictive Search, we get paid a percentage of sales generated by a client's Google Shopping campaigns, which means we only get paid for the completed sales. We believe our pay-for-performance pricing model clearly links the cost of a marketing campaign to its effectiveness, and is valued as such by our clients. Our revenue retention rate was 147%, 138% and 120% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.5 We define our revenue retention rate as (i) revenue recognized during a period from clients that contributed to revenue recognized in the prior corresponding period divided by (ii) total revenue recognized in such prior corresponding period. We believe that consistently having over 77% of our Revenue ex-TAC generated from clients that have uncapped budgets demonstrates our ability to maintain a high level of revenue retention. As a result, we believe our ability to retain and grow revenue from our existing clients is a useful indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our client relationships.

Our clients have 24/7 access to a unified dashboard to manage their campaigns, product by product. As a result, we reduce unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes and multiple vendors for our clients, delivering efficiencies even as clients' campaigns grow. Our solution, as we define it, is available as a unique and comprehensive offering and cannot be broken down and purchased as separate services.
As clients have embraced our solution, we have achieved significant growth since our inception and have established a global presence. As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 14,000 clients that used our solution, including some of the largest and most sophisticated ecommerce companies in the world, as well as world-class consumer brands.
Our financial results include:

• | revenue of $988.2 million, $1,323.2 million and $1,799.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively;


• | revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs, which we refer to as Revenue ex-TAC, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $402.8 million, $534.0 million and $730.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively;


• | net income of $46.9 million, $62.3 million and $87.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively; and


• | Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, of $105.4 million, $143.4 million and $224.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

Please see footnotes 3 and 5 to the "Other Financial and Operating Data" table in "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" in this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Revenue ex-TAC to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, in each case the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or "U.S. GAAP".
Industry Background
The ability to engage and convert customers is a critical success factor for most companies, especially for businesses in the ecommerce sector, who often dedicate a significant portion of their cost base to developing such an ability. Business to consumer ecommerce sales in retail and travel were approximately $2.6 trillion globally in 2016, and are expected to grow at an 18% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, to $4.3 trillion in 2019, according to eMarketer. The internet and mobile devices continue to be critical to generating customer engagement and leads that ultimately result in sales, both online and offline. However, these advertising mediums are also complex and fragmented, making it difficult and costly to engage and convert customers. For example, the global cart abandonment rate, or the percentage of online customers leaving their order behind instead of purchasing, was 74.4% in the third quarter 2016 according to SaleCycle, including 73.9% in the Retail vertical and 80.4% in the Travel vertical. It is therefore important for businesses to develop and execute marketing campaigns across all digital devices, effectively capitalizing on large amounts of consumer intent data, machine-learning technology, and the ability to target and measure at scale.
There are two primary channels for customer engagement and conversion in the digital space - search and display. According to eMarketer, marketers spent $179 billion on digital search and display advertising combined in 2016, with this spend expected to grow at a 15.3% CAGR to over $316 billion in 2020. Search marketing, which mainly consists of placing text-based and/or product listing advertisements alongside user query results, represented 50.0% of the combined digital search and display advertising spend in 2016, according to eMarketer. It is expected to grow from $89.5 billion in 2016 at a 13.9% CAGR to $150.6 billion in 2020, according to eMarketer.

Historically, search has been effective at capturing consumer intent and quickly delivering highly targeted advertisements based on query keywords, showing measurable results through simple, pay-for-performance pricing, and creating an automated and efficient marketplace for advertising inventory. Shopping ads are making up a larger part of overall retailer budgets for search, with shopping ad spend growing from 18% of global search ad spend in January 2014 to 28% in March 2016, according to Marin Software.
Internet display advertising involves placing images, video or advertisements that incorporate animation, sound and/or interactivity, which we refer to as rich media content, alongside website and mobile application content. According to eMarketer, display advertising accounted for 50.0% of the $179 billion combined market in 2016, and is projected to grow at a 16.7% CAGR to $166 billion in 2020. The display advertising market is more fragmented and is growing at a faster rate than search, due in part to the rapid rise of mobile internet usage, as well as the continued proliferation of content across the internet, including on social media platforms. Through internet display advertising, businesses can deliver effective advertisements integrating rich media. These attributes have led display advertising to be well suited to broad marketing objectives, including generating awareness and favorability for brands as opposed to the intent-driven performance objectives of search.
Internet display advertising faces a number of important challenges as an effective intent-driven medium for customer engagement and conversion, including:
Difficult to Deliver Targeted, Relevant Ads. Businesses strive for targeted, relevant advertisements to minimize wasted spend and maximize their chances of generating engagement, and ultimately a sale. Relevant advertisements are ones that target a specific audience, or a specific user, with a message that matches that audience's, or that specific user's, purchase intent or interest and that are delivered at the right moment. Achieving relevance, however, is particularly difficult because users are scattered across online destinations and devices, and consumer purchase intent and interest can be hard to determine or can change rapidly. Against this backdrop, traditional internet display advertising solutions have incorporated limited personalization capabilities. In addition, these solutions have generally not been effective in utilizing consumer intent as a signal for the delivery of advertisements. As a result, targeting and messaging have mainly been done by buying advertising impressions for generic audiences and placing generic advertisements alongside certain types of content (e.g., non-personalized automotive advertisements on sites related to cars), without incorporating purchase intent or interests. These traditional campaigns often lack relevance, and as a consequence result in limited user engagement and conversion.
Difficult to Deliver Performance at Scale. Many internet display advertising solutions are unable to sustain performance for larger campaigns or longer trials due in part to the highly fragmented nature of the internet display landscape, increasing amounts of data and lack of robust technology. Therefore, the challenges described above are amplified for larger and more complex campaigns.
Pricing Disconnected from Performance. Internet display advertising inventory has historically been sold on a cost per impression, or CPM, basis, meaning that an advertiser is charged each time an advertisement is displayed, whether or not a user interacted with the advertisement. This makes it difficult for advertisers to determine the true cost of an advertising campaign and evaluate the relationship of that cost to the effectiveness of the campaign in driving engagement and sales. Today, there are a few different pricing models generally available in the internet advertising market, including the traditional CPM pricing model, as well as cost per click, or CPC, pricing model, where an advertiser is charged when a user clicks on the advertisement, cost per action, or CPA, pricing model, where an advertiser is charged when a user takes a specific action, and hybrid pricing models, which reflect a combination of one or more of these models. While the search segment of the internet advertising market is generally priced on a CPC model, we believe the internet display advertisement segment of the internet advertising market has generally been and continues to be priced on a CPM basis.
6

Inefficient Campaign Execution. Deployment of internet display advertising campaigns can be inefficient and costly. Traditional solutions are often a combination of many point solutions, requiring businesses to connect and manage multiple intermediaries and complex elements of the advertising campaign execution process, including media planning, data analysis, targeting, creative assembly, media buying, optimization, advertisement serving and reporting. In addition, meaningful portions of campaign planning, execution and management remain highly manual.
Lack of Performance Display Advertising Options for Brand Manufacturers. Brand manufacturers, who usually do not directly sell their products online via their own ecommerce store but instead rely on multi-brand ecommerce stores for that purpose, face a number of significant challenges when they attempt to invest in performance-based digital advertising outside of search, to engage their customers and drive online sales. As a result, brand manufacturers have a very limited number of options to advertise their products on a performance basis via display campaigns and to get a clear and measurable view of how such advertising campaigns drive their sales.
We believe internet display advertising has reached a critical inflection point where its potential to be both a brand building medium and a more effective engagement and conversion medium has finally materialized. This transformation is being driven by powerful technology trends including:
Machine Learning. According to IDC Research, from now until 2020, the digital universe is expected to double every two years. The large and diverse data sets that make up this digital information are often referred to as big data and are generally categorized into business application data, human-generated content and machine data. New computational approaches and the falling costs of computing power enable technology companies to process and draw insights from this data using machine-learning approaches. These insights can be used to optimize display advertising campaigns in ways that were not previously possible. The ability to collect, collate and analyze shopping intent data points using machine-learning technology, is becoming a key differentiator for advertisers, including for brand manufacturers.
Programmatic Buying. Technologies for more automated and efficient buying and selling of display advertising have been gaining traction for several years with both advertisers and publishers. Programmatic buying from real-time, automated buying platforms and bidding exchanges, as well as through relationships with publishers, provide advertisers with dynamic, targeted and efficient ways to access the proper inventory, and help publishers to maximize the value of their advertising inventory. Worldwide spending in programmatic display advertising is expected to grow from $19 billion in 2016 to $42 billion in 2020 according to MAGNA, representing a CAGR of 22%.
Mobile and Cross-Device Commerce. Penetration of smartphones and tablets is driving rapid growth of global mobile commerce. Mobile commerce represented $429 billion globally in 2016, and is expected to grow at a 25% CAGR between 2016 and 2018 according to Statista. In addition, consumers increasingly use multiple devices to interact with ecommerce websites and mobile applications. Accordingly, transactions involving the usage of multiple devices, referred to as "cross-device" transactions, represent a fast-growing share of ecommerce, and mobile commerce in particular.
In addition, we believe the search marketing landscape for ecommerce retailers is now ready for disruption.
Although search has been an effective marketing channel to deliver measurable results through simple, pay-for-performance pricing, advertisers still face a number of complexities and challenges when buying search advertising. While several changes introduced in the search marketing ecosystem over the past few years, including Product Listing Ads ("PLA") formats, the provision of Remarketing Lists for Search Advertising ("RLSA"), and the opportunity to make bid modifications in real time, have brought new opportunities to search buyers, they also came with increased complexity with respect to implementation and execution. 
7

In particular, for large ecommerce retailers with vast product catalogs, such complexities and challenges may include: the automated structuring of their product catalog and linkage of product attributes with relevant query keywords; the building and structuring of user lists; grouping users according to multiple variables (including but not limited to users' digital devices, shopping intent types, intensity by product category or users' past and recent shopping behavior); and real-time bid modification per query keyword or query product according to a specific user list.
While traditional agencies and software providers in the fragmented Search Engine Marketing ("SEM") landscape have approached this evolving market through the provision of bidding or workflow automation tools, we believe significant opportunities have now emerged for the provision of a comprehensive and scalable machine-learning technology approach to search, in particular for ecommerce retailer advertisers. We believe our Criteo Predictive Search product brings better performance from search marketing to retailers through sophisticated, automated and end-to-end technology.
Competitive Strengths of our Solution
We believe our solution transforms the way our clients use digital performance marketing to drive sales by making digital performance marketing, and in particular digital display advertising, a more efficient and effective medium for engaging consumers and converting them into buyers. We believe the following competitive strengths will enable us to capture increasingly greater digital performance marketing spend:
Powerful, Scalable Technology & Network Effects. Our solution is the result of 11 years of research and development and investment in our technology platform. The Criteo Engine is supported by a flexible and scalable high-performance computing infrastructure, made of two Hadoop clusters hosting 76,000 processing cores with total storage capacity of 127,000 terabytes and 363 terabytes of random-access memory. Every day, our platform can process 100 terabytes of additional compressed data. We own approximately 20,000 servers through a global network of eight data centers. We believe our core technology assets are increasingly hard to replicate by other market participants. Our technology platform, which is developed and maintained by a team of over 600 engineers, operates at significant scale and is powered by machine-learning algorithms whose accuracy and performance improve with each new piece of information about a user and the billions of advertising impressions we analyze daily, creating a cycle of increasing network effects. As clients spend more with us and we attract more publisher inventory and deliver more advertisements, our data assets grow, enabling us to deliver even more precisely targeted and personalized advertisements and generate additional sales for our clients. As a result, we believe more advertisers will use our solution and increase their spend with us. This, in turn, will enable us to increase advertising revenue for our publishers, further expanding our publisher network and enhancing our ability to drive increasing volumes of sales for advertisers. We expect this cycle of self-reinforcing network effects will continue to contribute to fueling our growth.
Highly Relevant, Targeted Ads. Through our deep data-driven understanding of consumer intent and behavior, we are able to deliver highly relevant, targeted and personalized advertisements across multiple digital devices. Substantially all of our clients grant us access to their detailed consumer purchase intent and behavior data through integration with their websites and mobile applications. More broadly, our own operating data includes insights from user responses to each advertisement that we provide, which we use to continually improve our performance. The scale and breadth of our data is constantly growing as users interact with our clients and as we deliver advertising impressions. For example, in 2016, we delivered over 974 billion targeted advertisements. By dynamically matching what we believe to be a user's intent or interest with a personalized advertisement, we are able to deliver more relevant and engaging advertisements to users, which are more likely to lead to sales. Our average click-through rate, or the ratio of clicks generated by our advertisements over the number of advertising impressions we purchased ("CTR"), was over 0.76% in 2016, which represents a factor of over four times the average click-through rate of 0.19%, as measured by the DoubleClick display benchmark tool for 2016. We believe our superior click-through rate illustrates the superior performance of our solution.
8

Performance-Driven Business Model and Transparency of Return-On-Investment. We only get paid when a user engages with one of our advertisements, usually by clicking on it. This model is well proven in search marketing, and our clients value pay-for-performance pricing for providing a clear link between the cost of their marketing campaign and its effectiveness in driving sales for them. In the specific case of Criteo Predictive Search, we get paid a percentage of the sales generated by a client's Google Shopping campaigns, which means we only get paid for completed sales. As the Criteo Engine becomes more sophisticated, we are increasingly optimizing our solution not just to maximize clicks at a target CPC, but to maximize post-click sales at a target cost of sales. As a result, most of our clients now set their budgets with us whereby their total spend with us is effectively constrained mainly by our ability to find enough relevant opportunities for them that achieve their specific return objectives. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2016, over 77% of our Revenue ex-TAC was derived from clients whose budgets were either uncapped or so large that the budget constraint did not restrict purchases of advertisements by us. In addition, existing advertiser clients continue to increase their advertising spend with us as illustrated by our 120% revenue retention rate for Criteo Dynamic Retargeting for the year ended December 31, 2016, demonstrating our ability to drive revenue expansion within our existing client base.
We use the industry-standard last-click attribution model to measure the effectiveness of our solution for our advertiser clients. We believe that our return-on-investment calculation methodology, based on post-click sales, is a relevant proxy for the sales we generate for our clients. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we estimate that our solution helped generate approximately 8% of the total online sales of our retail clients with uncapped budgets.6 As a result, we believe that marketers view their spend with Criteo as a transparent and elastic cost of sales, as opposed to a traditional discretionary marketing spend.
Complete Performance Solution Including our Large-Scale User Graph. Our solution covers the entire consumer journey, working seamlessly across digital devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets), digital environments (web and mobile applications), platforms (Google's Android, Apple's iOS and other operating systems), marketing channels (display, including social and native, search, and sponsored products advertisements on ecommerce retailers' sites), and publisher ecosystems (Google, Facebook and thousands of publishers in the open web). With the dramatic increase in smartphone and tablet usage in an increasingly fragmented digital landscape, it has become critical for marketers to engage and convert their customers across multiple digital devices. We believe that, for advertisers looking to engage with their prospects or customers irrespective of the digital device, digital environment, platform, marketing channel or publisher ecosystem where the user may be, our complete performance solution provides a clear advantage over other solutions available on the market. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, virtually all of our clients used our multi-screen solution, including on desktop and mobile devices, and 63% of our Revenue ex-TAC was generated by clicks on advertisements delivered on mobile devices. At the end of 2014, we launched our "Universal Match" cross-device matching solution that allows us to match users across several devices. Through Universal Match, we are able, for a single user, to capture shopping intent data from one device, show an ad on another device and track sale conversion on a third device. At December 31, 2016, over 73% of our clients contributed non-identifying Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") data points that enable the exact match of users across multiple devices and the building of a large-scale user graph. We believe our complete performance solution, including our powerful, large-scale user graph, will increasingly become a competitive strength.

Deep Liquidity of Demand and Supply. Over multiple years, we have built an extensive network of relationships with our advertiser clients and publishers, creating a highly liquid marketplace for internet display advertising inventory. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 14,000 advertiser clients, including some of the largest ecommerce companies in the world and approximately 82% of our advertiser relationships were directly with the advertiser in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top 10 clients represented 11.8% of our revenue. As we continue to grow our client base, we will continue to grow the number of users who interact with our advertisements, which will allow us to benefit from greater scale when we purchase inventory from publisher partners. On the supply side, we have direct relationships with thousands of publisher partners and are also integrated with the leading advertising exchanges and networks. A dedicated team of approximately 130 professionals is focused on building and maintaining our direct relationships with publishers, many of whom have granted us preferred access to portions of their internet display advertising inventory. For the month of January 2016, comScore data indicated that over 1.2 billion unique users saw Criteo advertisements on the desktop alone, representing the second largest reach worldwide. Our deep and liquid marketplace has enabled us to increase our reach and access to quality advertising inventory, allowing us to quickly match an advertisement to a user before purchase intent has diminished.
Simple End-To-End Solution and Highly Efficient Campaign Execution at Scale. Our solution is end-to-end: it encompasses the integration of our advertiser clients' digital properties, the tracking of users, the real-time buying of impressions on publishers' digital properties, the real-time creation of customized advertisements for each specific client and its prospective end customer, the serving and delivery of the advertisements and the provision of real-time analytics on the performance of marketing campaigns. In addition, our clients have 24/7 access to a unified dashboard to manage their performance marketing, product by product. Our platform automates most of the processes associated with executing a performance marketing campaign, such as creative assembly, real-time buying of inventory and campaign optimization, and billing. Using our platform, our clients are able to drive sales based on their specific cost of sales or return on investment objectives in large volumes with real-time control over the price they pay. As a result, we reduce unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes and multiple providers involved in performance marketing campaign management. Further, we are able to continue to deliver these efficiencies even as marketing campaigns scale and become more complex.
Extensive Reach and Global Presence. We do business in over 90 countries and have a direct operating presence in 19 countries. For 2016, close to 42% of our revenue was derived from clients who conducted marketing campaigns with us in more than one national market. We have achieved this global presence by replicating and scaling our business model across geographic markets. Large businesses are increasingly seeking global marketing partners with comprehensive performance solutions that are effective across multiple geographies. We believe we are able to meet this demand by leveraging our scalable technology and global network of relationships and are well positioned to serve our clients in nearly every market in which they seek to drive sales.
Commitment to Privacy. We are committed to consumer privacy. The user information we collect relates primarily to purchase intent and is therefore not considered to be information that can directly identify a user. In 2009, we became one of the first companies to include a link in all the advertisements we deliver, which gives users access to clear, transparent, detailed and user-friendly information about personalized advertisements and the data practices associated with the advertisements they receive. In addition, we provide consumers with an easy-to-use and easy-to-access mechanism to control their advertising experience and opt out of receiving targeted advertisements we deliver or send, either for all campaigns or for a specific client or specific period of time. We believe that this transparent consumer-centric approach to privacy empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions about our use of their data. We also actively encourage our advertiser clients and publishers to provide information to consumers about our collection and use of data relating to advertisements we deliver and track.

Our Growth Opportunities 
Our vision is to build the world's performance marketing platform for commerce and brands. Our goal is to drive post-click sales at scale for our clients at their target return on investment, through customer engagement and conversion, across multiple marketing channels. We are currently expanding our business and strengthening our performance marketing platform through multiple growth opportunities, both within our core business and in new areas focused on performance marketing. The core elements of our growth strategy include:
Continuing to Innovate and Invest in Technology and Data. We intend to continue to make substantial investments in research and development to further increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution by improving our machine-learning algorithms and underlying technology platform. In addition, as the rich data sets that drive performance on a real-time basis are central to our technology and product investments, we also intend to continue to develop ways of extracting greater value from the data we collect for the benefit of our clients. We believe our technology, product and data investments will continue to enhance our value proposition for both existing and prospective clients and publisher partners.
Selectively Broadening our Spectrum of Marketing Channels. We started delivering our solution through internet display advertisements in desktop browsers. Since then, we have expanded into mobile in-browser and in-app, native display, including on social media platforms, search engine marketing and sponsored products advertisements on ecommerce retailers' sites. We intend to continue to invest in our existing marketing channels. For example, we are currently exploring potential ways to expand into performance-based video advertising. We also intend to expand selectively into additional marketing channels, in order to help our clients generate more sales across a broader range of marketing channels while always using a single solution priced on a transparent performance-based model. In addition, we are exploring the possibility of measuring the impact of our digital campaigns on our clients' in-store sales. We believe a broader platform of complementary marketing channels, all based on measurable performance, will enhance our value proposition for existing and prospective clients.
Broadening our Supply of Quality Advertising Inventory. We already partner with thousands of publishers globally for display advertising with Criteo Dynamic Retargeting. While we work with both real-time bidding internet display exchanges and direct publishers, including premium publishers, 44% of our Revenue ex-TAC in the second quarter of 2016 was generated from inventory sourced from publishers with whom we have a preferred relationship. We intend to maintain a high level of preferred relationships, with both premium and mid-sized publishers. In addition, we continue to broaden our supply of quality advertising inventory, with a particular focus on mobile, native and social inventory. With Criteo Sponsored Products for brand manufacturers, we intend to increase our publisher reach by providing a broader share of our existing retailer client base the opportunity to monetize their website inventory. We believe a broader supply of quality advertising inventory will continue to enhance our value proposition for existing and prospective clients, including both commerce and brand advertisers.
Expanding our Client Base of Brand Manufacturers. Our solution primarily addresses performance marketing for companies in the digital retail, travel and classifieds verticals. As a result, our client base includes some of the largest and most sophisticated ecommerce companies in the world. Through Criteo Sponsored Products, we now also address the needs for measurable performance marketing of brand manufacturers, who can advertise their products on major ecommerce retailers sites. We believe the marketing spend of brand manufacturers on a performance basis represents a significant opportunity for us. We intend to continue to broaden our client base to brand manufacturers through the expansion of Criteo Sponsored Products on a larger number of ecommerce retailers' sites. We believe our powerful and measurable performance solution, along with our large base of ecommerce retailer partners, will enhance our value proposition for existing and prospective clients in the large brand manufacturers vertical.

Leveraging our User Graph Pooled Asset to Convert our Clients' Customers Across All Devices. We deliver performance marketing across multiple digital devices and environments. With the dramatic increase in smartphone and tablet usage in an increasingly fragmented digital landscape, it has become critical for marketers to engage and convert their customers across multiple digital devices. At December 31, 2016, over 73% of our clients contributed non-identifying CRM data points that enable the exact match of users across multiple devices and the building of a large-scale user graph. In the fourth quarter of 2016, approximately 60% of our Revenue ex-TAC was generated by clicks from users matched on at least two devices through our "Universal Match" technology. Given the significant scale that building a relevant and powerful user graph requires, we believe our pooled asset will increasingly become a competitive strength. As a result, we believe our large-scale user graph will continue to enhance our value proposition for existing and prospective clients, in particular in the competitive retail sector.
Expanding our Presence in Core Markets and Penetrating New Geographic Markets. We believe significant opportunities remain for us to grow our business in geographic markets where we already operate, such as Western Europe, the United States and Japan. Additionally, we plan to leverage and grow our existing sales teams as we expand operations in markets entered more recently. We have a strong track record of entering new markets successfully and rapidly achieving commercial traction. We believe our broad global presence will continue to enhance our value proposition for existing and prospective global ecommerce and brand advertisers.
Continuing to Grow our Client Base Across Advertiser Categories. We intend to continue growing our client base, both in the large client and the midmarket categories. During 2015 and 2016, we invested significantly to capture the midmarket opportunity and intend to continue investing in this promising market segment. In particular, we plan to expand our midmarket presence in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia-Pacific.
Addressing Additional Marketing Objectives Along the Customer Lifecycle. We started delivering our solution by addressing the direct-response marketing objectives of ecommerce advertisers looking to generate sales at a targeted return on investment through our Criteo Dynamic Retargeting product. With our existing product portfolio, we have demonstrated the strength and measurability of our performance-based solution in customer retargeting. In order to accompany our clients along a larger part of the customer lifecycle, and in particular help them acquire prospective customers, we intend to invest in developing products that address acquisition marketing objectives, while always using a single solution priced on a transparent performance-based model. For example, we are exploring potential ways to expand into customer prospecting and installation of mobile applications by new customers. We believe expanding into a broader set of marketing objectives, while always measuring performance in a clear and accountable way, will enhance our value proposition for existing and prospective clients.
Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions. We selectively evaluate technologies and businesses that we believe have potential to enhance, complement or expand our technology platform and product portfolio or strengthen our research and development team. We target acquisitions that can be efficiently integrated into our technology infrastructure and global operations, while preserving the quality and performance of our offering. We believe we are an acquirer of choice among prospective acquisition targets due to our entrepreneurial culture, growth, global scale, strong brand and market position.

Our Solution 
Our technology delivers digital performance marketing. We generate post-click sales for our clients by efficiently and effectively engaging and converting customers across multiple marketing channels. Our solution is comprised of the Criteo Engine, our data assets, access to publisher inventory, and our advertiser and publisher platforms.
Criteo Engine 
The Criteo Engine leverages the vast and high-quality data assets developed through our extensive relationships with thousands of advertisers and publishers, as well as our significant operational history, with the goal of delivering, in real time, highly relevant and personalized digital performance advertisements that engage and convert consumers.
The Criteo Engine consists of:

• | Recommendation algorithms. These algorithms dynamically create and tailor advertisements to specific user interest by determining the specific products and services to include in the advertisement. These products and services may be ones that a user has already been exposed to, or to a large extent, that the algorithms predict the user could be interested in. Alternatively, these products and services may be ones that other users, who have been exposed to some of the same products and services as such user, have been interested in.


• | User value prediction and predictive bidding algorithms. These algorithms predict the probability and nature of a user's engagement with a given advertisement, in the form, for example, of clicks, conversions, basket value, or even specific product categories purchased. This prediction of engagement incorporates data from our advertiser clients, publishers and third-party sources, including user intent, who the advertiser is, the products offered by the advertiser client, as well as data on the creative content of the advertisement and the publisher context in which the advertisement is viewed. Together with our recommendation algorithms, the prediction algorithms allow us to determine the most appropriate price to pay for an advertising impression based on an individual user's predicted engagement, conversion and conversion value, as well as what the advertiser client is willing to pay for that engagement.


• | Bidding engine. Our bidding engine executes campaigns based on certain objectives set by our clients (for example, cost-per-click limits and number of sales). After a bid is placed and won, the Criteo Engine assembles and delivers individualized advertisements and provides campaign reporting, all in near-real time.


• | Dynamic creative optimization. Based on the results of our algorithms, the Criteo Engine automatically assembles customized advertising content on an impression-by-impression basis in real time, by optimizing each individual creative component in the advertisement, from the font, color, size of product pictures to the "call to action" or price discount. Our "Kinetic Design" creative technology offers virtually unlimited personalization, with up to 17 trillion visual ad variations, while maintaining advertisers' brand consistency.


• | Software systems and processes. Our algorithms are supported by robust software infrastructure that allows our solution to operate seamlessly at scale. The architecture and processing capabilities of this technology have been designed to match the massive computational demands and complexity of the algorithms. This technology enables data synchronization, storage and analysis across a large-scale distributed computing infrastructure in multiple geographies, as well as fast data collection and retrieval using multi-layered caching infrastructure.


• | Experimentation platform. This offline/online platform is used to improve the prediction abilities of our models by measuring the correlation of specific parameters with user engagement, usually measured by clicks and conversions (typically in the form of sales). A dedicated team is constantly testing new types and sources of data to determine whether they help to diminish the gap between predicted engagement and conversion and actual observed engagement and conversion over the course of a live campaign.

Data Assets 
The accuracy of our algorithms improves with both the increasing quantity and quality of data we obtain from our clients and publishers, as well as insights gained through our extensive operational history. Using cookies and similar tracking technologies, we collect information about the interaction of users with our advertisers' and publishers' digital properties (including, for example, information about the placement of advertisements and users' shopping or other interactions with our clients' digital properties or advertisements). We have access to large volumes of granular data from our clients, which carry consumer intent and are directly relevant to those clients' campaigns. The information we collect does not enable us to identify the particular user. Our clients grant us access to their valuable data through direct integration with us, which requires our clients to place Criteo software code throughout their digital properties. This integration gives us privileged insight into users' behavioral history at the product level for each client, representing a very high-quality data asset. We use the shopping intent data from each specific client solely for the benefit of that specific client's marketing campaigns.
In addition to client data, we seek to use as much information as possible about the context or intent of a given user to further refine our prediction accuracy. We collect this data directly from our advertiser clients or publishers.
In addition to consumer shopping intent data, some of our advertiser clients give us access to non-identifying CRM data, creating a pooled asset to enable us to match users across multiple digital devices, through deterministic technology, in order to build a large-scale user graph benefiting all clients who contribute such CRM data.
Access to Inventory 
Through our relationships with the leading real-time bidding, or "RTB," internet display exchanges, and thousands of publisher partners, including through our Publisher Marketplace, we provide extensive access to advertising inventory. In some cases, we have negotiated direct and privileged access with publishers, giving us the opportunity to purchase on an impression-per-impression basis and in real time: (1) inventory that a publisher might otherwise only sell subject to minimum volume commitments; and/or (2) particular advertising impressions before such impressions are made available to other potential buyers. For example, in Japan, we have entered into a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan, giving us privileged access to its advertising inventory for delivering personalized display advertisements. With Criteo Sponsored Products, we access inventory from ecommerce retailers’ sites that is generally not available to traditional advertising demand. This sponsored product inventory from ecommerce retailers is a valuable source of inventory for brand manufacturers to advertise their products on a performance basis.
Across both our direct publisher relationships and inventory purchasing done on advertising exchanges, we leverage the Criteo Engine's ability to quickly and accurately value available advertising inventory, and utilize that information to bid for inventory on a programmatic, automated basis. Our ability to efficiently access and value inventory results in deep liquidity, allowing us to deliver effective advertisements at the right price for our clients, even as the size and complexity of campaigns increases.
For Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, we purchase inventory from our direct publishers generally through insertion orders consistent with industry standard terms and conditions for the purchase of internet advertising inventory. Pursuant to such arrangements, we purchase impressions on a CPM basis for users that Criteo recognizes on the publishers' network. Such arrangements are cancellable upon short notice and without penalty. For Criteo Sponsored Products, we pay for the inventory of our ecommerce retailer partners on a revenue sharing basis, effectively paying the retailers a portion of the click-based revenue generated by user clicks on the sponsored products advertisements displaying the products of our brand manufacturer clients. For Criteo Predictive Search, we do not source the search inventory ourselves. Our advertiser clients have direct access to Google Shopping inventory, and we optimize the bidding price for such inventory on behalf of these clients to maximize the sales generated by their shopping campaigns.
14

Through the direct relationships we have with publishers, we take measures to determine that the publisher's inventory meets our content requirements and the content requirements of our clients to ensure that their display advertisements are not shown in inappropriate content categories, such as adult or political content. With respect to our inventory purchased through RTB exchanges, we utilize third-party software to verify that the inventory where the advertisement placement is shown conforms to our advertising guidelines and the content expectations and branding guidelines of our advertiser clients.
Advertiser and Publisher Platforms
We offer our clients an integrated technology platform that enables comprehensive visibility and includes a unified and easy-to-use dashboard and a suite of software and services that automates key campaign processes. As a result, we reduce unnecessary complexity and cost associated with manual processes and multiple vendors, delivering efficiencies even as campaigns grow.
Our integrated solution includes a comprehensive suite of services and software tools, including:

• | A unified dashboard to manage campaigns, product by product. This dashboard automates a number of campaign execution and management tasks. Key attributes of the dashboard include:


▪ | easy-to-use interface;


▪ | 24/7 availability;


▪ | granular control, with the ability to specify product categories and bid at the category level; and


▪ | transparent and detailed reporting of key campaign metrics, such as CPCs, impressions served, effective cost per thousand impressions, or eCPM, and post-click sales.


• | Business intelligence and analytics. We provide high value-added consulting services to our larger clients through a team of advisers that aid them in setting goals for, extracting insights from, and evaluating trends and performance of their marketing campaigns across our different sources of inventory supply, marketing channels, and the multiple digital devices that consumers may use.


• | Publisher Marketplace. We also offer small and mid-sized publishers direct access to advertisers by providing a comprehensive inventory management platform that we call the Criteo Publisher Marketplace ("PuMP"), which allows us to access the inventory of these publishers, without directly managing that inventory. Through this platform, our small- and mid-sized publisher partners have access to:


▪ | an easy-to-use interface;


▪ | 24/7 availability;


▪ | control to specify minimum prices for each publisher’s inventory; and


▪ | reporting that allows each publisher to monitor the amount of money they have made selling their inventory to us.

Strategic Relationship with Yahoo! Japan
In August 2012, we entered into a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan, a leading provider of advertising inventory in Japan, which provides us with privileged access to their performance-based display inventory. In connection with this strategic relationship, Yahoo! Japan invested in our subsidiary, Criteo K.K. We retain 66% ownership of Criteo K.K. and Yahoo! Japan holds 34% ownership. Yahoo! Japan has the right to require us to buy back its interest upon the occurrence of certain events (such as bankruptcy or breach of obligations), and we have the right to require them to sell their interest in Criteo K.K. under specified circumstances, such as a termination of the commercial relationship. 
This strategic relationship may be terminated by either party for material breach and other customary events. The term of this strategic relationship was renewed to August 2017 and will renew automatically thereafter for one-year terms if neither party provides advance written notice of its intent not to renew within a specified period of time. 
Infrastructure
Our ability to deliver our solution depends on our highly sophisticated global technology software and hardware infrastructure. Our global infrastructure includes approximately 20,000 servers, including two Hadoop clusters comprising 2,130 servers providing a storage capacity exceeding 127,000 terabytes and 363 terabytes of random-access memory. Our global infrastructure is divided into four independent geographic zones in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, EMEA and mainland China. In each of the zones, our services are delivered through data centers that support these zones. We generally rely on more than one data center in any given zone. The data centers are strategically placed within large zones to be close to our advertiser clients, publishers and users. This has the benefit of minimizing the impact of network latency within a particular zone, especially for time-constrained services such as RTB. In addition, we replicate data across multiple data centers to maximize availability and performance. We also generally seek to distribute workload across multiple locations in order to avoid overloads in our systems and increase reliability through redundancy.
Within each data center, computing power is provided by horizontal build-outs of commodity servers arranged in multiple, highly redundant pools. Some of these pools are dedicated to handling incoming traffic and delivering advertisements and others are devoted to the data analytics involved in creating these advertisements. In particular, we use clusters using software specifically designed for processing large data sets, such as Hadoop, to run offline data analyses. The results are then fed back to refresh and improve our prediction and recommendation algorithms.
We use multiple-layered security controls to protect the Criteo Engine and data assets, including hardware- and software-based access controls for our source code and production systems, segregated networks for different components of our production systems and centralized production systems management.
Our Clients 
Our client base consists primarily of companies in the digital retail, travel and classifieds verticals and includes some of the largest and most sophisticated ecommerce companies in the world. These companies range from large, global, diversified ecommerce companies to mid-sized regional companies. With Criteo Sponsored Products, we also serve brand manufacturers as advertiser clients. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 14,000 clients, representing advertisers who had a marketing campaign live with us on any given day over a 12 trailing-month period. In 2016, approximately 82% of our client relationships were held directly with the advertiser. 
We believe our business is not substantially dependent on any particular client or group of clients. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, our largest client represented 2.9%, 1.9% and 2.0% of our revenue, respectively, and in 2016 our largest 10 clients represented 11.8% of our revenue in the aggregate. 
16

There is no group of customers under common control or customers that are affiliates of each other constituting an aggregate amount equal to 10% or more of our consolidated revenues, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
We define a client to be a unique party from whom we have received an insertion order and delivered an advertisement during the previous 12 months. We count specific brands or divisions within the same business as distinct clients so long as those entities have separately signed insertion orders with us. On the other hand, we count a client who runs campaigns in multiple geographies as a single client, even though multiple insertion orders may be involved. When the insertion order is with an advertising agency, we generally consider the client on whose behalf the marketing campaign is conducted as the "client" for purposes of this calculation. In the event a client has its marketing spend with us managed by multiple agencies, that client is counted as a single client.
Our client base is composed of two client categories: the large client category and the midmarket category. We define large clients typically as the top-100 or the top-200 advertiser websites per vertical in a given geographic market, depending on the depth of that market, based on the number of monthly unique visitors as measured by comScore or other third-party providers of such information. We define a midmarket client as any client outside of the top-100 or top-200 advertisers per vertical in a given geographic market, depending on the depth of that market, and with a certain minimum threshold number of unique monthly visitors to their digital property, as measured by comScore or other third-party providers of such information. This minimum threshold varies by market, but is generally around 40,000 unique monthly visitors for our more developed markets.
Research and Development 
We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our solution and technology infrastructure, develop new features, conduct quality assurance testing and improve our core technology. Our engineering group is primarily located in research and development centers in Paris, France, Grenoble, France, Palo Alto, California and Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect to continue to expand capabilities of our technology in the future and to invest significantly in continued research and development efforts. We had over 600 employees primarily engaged in research and development at December 31, 2016. Research and development expense totaled $60.1 million, $86.8 million and $123.6 million for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. We generally require employees, consultants, advertiser clients, publishers, suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality agreements with us that restrict the disclosure of our intellectual property. We also generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
Intellectual property laws, together with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, provide only limited protection, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of France and the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Agreements with our employees and consultants may also be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies to redress any breach. Further, to the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights to know-how and inventions relating thereto or resulting therefrom. Finally, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors and unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our solution or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
17

As of December 31, 2016, we held four patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and one patent issued by the French Patent Office, and had filed 23 non-provisional U.S. patent applications, one European patent application, one Japanese patent application and one international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. We also own and use registered and unregistered trademarks on or in connection with our products and services in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we have also registered numerous internet domain names.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have asserted and may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our advertiser clients or our publishers. Litigation and associated expenses may be necessary to enforce our proprietary rights.
Privacy, Data Protection and Content Control
Legal and Regulatory
Privacy and data protection laws play a significant role in our business. The regulatory environment for the collection and use of consumer data by advertising networks, advertisers and publishers is very unsettled in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The United States and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict industry participants’ ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share non-identifying data, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies.
In the United States, at both the federal and state level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us. At the federal level, online advertising activities in the United States have primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Section 5, to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices, including alleged violations of consumer privacy interests. Various states have also enacted legislation that governs these practices. For example, on September 27, 2013, the governor of California signed into law AB 370, an amendment to the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003, or CalOPPA. This amendment requires that we disclose in our privacy policy how we respond to web browser “do not track” signals. Our privacy policy discloses that we do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals but that we do respond to opt-out requests made through our proprietary opt-out button or through industry opt-out platforms (namely Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance).
In addition, our solution reaches users throughout the world, including in Europe, Australia, Canada, South America and Asia-Pacific. As a result, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions. In particular, data protection laws in Europe can be more restrictive regarding the collection and use of data than those in U.S. jurisdictions.
In the European Union, the two main pillars of the data protection legal framework are the E-Privacy Directive (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications), which is currently under review, and the new General Data Protection Regulation, adopted in April 2016.
Directive 2002/581-EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or the E-Privacy Directive, was amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 25, 2009, or the E-Privacy Directive Amendment, to require countries in the European Union to enact specific legislation requiring companies like ours, along with advertisers and publishers, to present users with an information notice and to obtain their consent prior to placing cookies or other tracking technologies for purposes of targeted advertising. The E-Privacy Directive Amendment was intended to be implemented in all 28 countries of the European Union, but it has been implemented differently across the European Union member states. Some member states, like the United Kingdom, permit companies to imply consent from the user’s proceeding onto the website and continuing his/her navigation after s/he has been clearly informed about how cookies are used without disabling them. 
18

Other member states currently require, through law and/or guidance, that the user’s consent must be obtained prior to the placement of cookies for targeted advertising purposes. The position regarding prior consent versus consent at the time of cookie dropping is not fully settled within the European Union. 
The position regarding explicit versus implied consent also is still not fully settled within the European Union. On October 2, 2013, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, a group with an advisory status composed of representatives of the European Union data protection authorities and the European Commission, issued new guidance on the obtaining of consent for cookies under the E-Privacy Directive and recommended that consent be expressed by the user’s positive action or other active behavior, such as clicking on a link, image or other content, based on clear information that cookies will be set due to this action. While the European Commission is still in the process of adopting a legislative proposal to review the E-Privacy Directive, there is no assurance that tracking for advertising purposes will not be affected, as "cookie" consent is being re-discussed. 
 In December 2016, E.U. institutions reached an agreement on a draft regulation that was formally adopted in April 2016, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). The GDPR updates and modernizes the principles of the 1995 Data Protection Directive. The GDPR significantly increases the level of sanctions for non-compliance. The European Union data protection authorities will have the power to impose administrative fines of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the data controller’s or data processor’s total worldwide global turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. The regulation should not have a material impact on our business or the way our technologies operate, however, interpretations of the GDPR may vary, especially with respect to the conditions for collection of a valid "non-ambiguous" consent, and thus there can be no assurance that this will be the case. The regulation will be enforced after a two-year transition period beginning in spring 2018. 
As we continue to expand into other foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.
Self-Regulation
In addition to complying with extensive government regulations, we voluntarily participate in several trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practices or codes of conduct relating to targeted advertising. For example, the Internet Advertising Bureau EU & US, the Network Advertising Initiative, the European Digital Advertising Alliance and the Digital Advertising Alliance have developed and implemented guidance for companies to provide notice and choice to users regarding targeted advertising.
In addition to complying with such guidance, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising, and allow them to opt out from the use of such data for the delivery of targeted advertising. In an effort to harmonize the industry’s approach to internet-based advertising, these programs facilitate a user’s ability to disable services of integrated providers, but also educate users on the potential benefits of online advertising, including access to free content and display of more relevant advertisements to them. The rules and policies of the self-regulatory programs that we participate in are updated from time to time and may impose additional restrictions upon us in the future.
In 2009, we became one of the first companies to broadly include a link in the advertisements we deliver, which gives access to clear, transparent, detailed and user-friendly information describing why a user is seeing an advertisement, as well as prominently describing our service and data management practices. In addition, we provide users with an easy-to-use and easy-to-access control mechanism to opt out of receiving advertisements we deliver or being tracked by us either for all campaigns or for a specific client or time period. We believe that this user-centric approach in addressing privacy matters empowers users to make informed decisions on the use of their data. We also actively encourage our clients to provide greater transparency and information about the collection and use of data. 
19

Content Control 
To protect against unlawful advertiser and publisher content, we include restrictions on content in our terms and conditions. We also manually review the websites of new publisher partners and use third-party software to screen impressions we acquire through advertising exchanges.
Government Regulation
In addition to the laws and regulations governing privacy and data protection described above, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. 
Competition 
We compete primarily in the market for digital performance marketing across multiple channels. Our market is rapidly evolving, highly competitive, complex and fragmented. We face significant competition in this market, which we expect to intensify in the future, partially as a result of potential new entrants in our market, including but not limited to large well-established internet publishers and players. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Adobe Systems, Inc. ("Adobe"), Alliance Data Systems, Corp. ("Alliance Data"), Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"), eBay Inc. ("eBay"), Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"), Alphabet Inc. ("Google") and Sociomantic Labs ("Sociomantic"), which is owned by Tesco plc, as well as smaller, privately held companies. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include: 

• | technology-based ability to deliver return on marketing spend at scale;


• | measurability of the marketing spend performance, based on accountable metrics;


• | comprehensiveness and efficiency of solution;


• | relevance and breadth of products;


• | seamlessness of solution across devices, environments, platforms, marketing channels and ecosystems;


• | client trust;


• | breadth and depth of publisher relationships;


• | global reach;


• | client service; and


• | ease of use.

We believe that we are well positioned with respect to all of these factors and expect to continue to grow and capture an increasing share of digital performance marketing budgets worldwide.
20

Seasonality
Our client base consists primarily of businesses in the digital retail, travel and classifieds industries. In the digital retail industry in particular, many businesses devote the largest portion of their advertising spend to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday spending by consumers. With respect to Criteo Sponsored Products, the concentration of advertising spend in the fourth quarter of the calendar year is particularly pronounced. Our ecommerce retail clients typically conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the first and second quarters than they do in other quarters, while our travel clients typically increase their travel campaigns in the first and third quarters and conduct fewer advertising campaigns in the second quarter. As a result, our revenue tends to be seasonal in nature, but the impact of this seasonality has, to date, been partly offset by our significant growth and geographic expansion. If the seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had over 2,500 employees. Our employees employed by French entities (approximately 800 employees) are represented by a labor union, employee representative bodies (works' council, employee delegates and a health and safety committee) and covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider labor relations to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.
