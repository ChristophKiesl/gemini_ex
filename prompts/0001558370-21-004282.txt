ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Argan, Inc. (“Argan”) conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gemma Power Systems, LLC and affiliates (“GPS”), Atlantic Projects Company Limited and affiliates (“APC”), The Roberts Company, Inc. (“TRC”) and Southern Maryland Cable, Inc. (“SMC”) (together referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Through GPS and APC, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development, technical and consulting services to the power generation market including the renewable energy sector. The wide range of customers includes independent power producers, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. Including variable interest entities (“VIEs”), GPS and APC represent the Company’s power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southeast region of the United States (the “US”) and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated metal components such as piping systems, pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Through SMC, which conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.
Holding Company Structure
Argan was organized as a Delaware corporation in May 1961. We intend to make additional opportunistic acquisitions and/or investments by identifying companies with significant potential for profitable growth and realizable synergies with one or more of our existing businesses. However, we may have more than one industrial focus depending on the opportunity. We expect that acquired companies will be maintained in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows for the Company and value for our stockholders. Argan is a holding company with current investments in GPS, APC, TRC and SMC.
Power Industry Services
The most significant percentage of our power industry services has been performed by GPS which is a full-service engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) services firm that we have operated for over fourteen years since it was acquired by us in 2006. GPS has the proven abilities of designing, building and commissioning large-scale energy projects in the US. The extensive design, construction, project management, start-up and operating experience of GPS has grown with installed capacity exceeding 15 gigawatts of mostly domestic power-generating capacity. Our power projects have included base-load combined-cycle facilities, simple-cycle peaking plants and boiler plant construction and renovation efforts. We also have experience in the renewable energy sector by providing EPC contracting and other services to the owners of alternative energy facilities, including biomass plants, wind farms and solar fields. Typically, the scope of work for GPS includes complete plant engineering and design, the procurement of equipment and construction from site development through electrical interconnection and plant testing. The durations of our construction projects typically range between one to three years. However, the length of certain significant construction projects may exceed three years.
This reportable business segment also includes APC, a company formed in the Irish city of Dublin over 45 years ago, and its affiliated companies, which we acquired in May 2015. APC provides turbine, boiler and large rotating equipment installation, commissioning and outage services to original equipment manufacturers, global construction firms and power plant owners. With its presence in the Republic of Ireland (“Ireland”), the United Kingdom (the “UK”) as well as the US, APC represents the portion of this segment’s business with an international focus. 
The revenues of our power industry services business segment were $319.4 million, $135.7 million and $367.8 million for the years ended January 31, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”), 2020 (“Fiscal 2020”) and 2019 (“Fiscal 2019”), respectively, or 81%, 57% and 76% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. The substantial portions of the revenues of this reportable segment reported for these three years were derived from the performance of activities by GPS and APC under EPC services and other construction contracts with the owners of power plant projects.

During Fiscal 2021, the operations of this reportable business segment were focused on construction for two major power plant projects.
Guernsey Power Station
In January 2019, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to construct an 1,875 MW natural gas-fired power plant in Guernsey County, Ohio (the “Guernsey Power Station”). Caithness Energy, L.L.C. (“Caithness”) partnered with Apex Power Group, LLC to develop this project. After receiving a full-notice-to-proceed, GPS commenced substantial activities for this project in August 2019. For Fiscal 2021, this project represented the major portion of consolidated revenues. Substantial completion of this major project is expected to occur during the second half of our fiscal year ending January 31, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023”).
Guernsey County is located in southeastern Ohio in the heart of the state’s Utica and Marcellus shale gas development area. Using state-of-the-art combined cycle technology and an air-cooling system, the Guernsey Power Station will be a cost-efficient, fuel-efficient electricity generating power plant that protects air quality and conserves water with the capability to satisfy the electricity needs of approximately one million homes. 
The combined cycle design of this plant utilizes three power trains with each one including a gas-fired turbine, a heat recovery steam generator and a steam turbine that will enable this plant to generate significantly more power from the equivalent amount of fuel than a traditional gas-fired power plant. The Guernsey Power Station will also use dry cooling technology to reduce water usage by as much as 95% compared to a water-cooled power plant. Because of its advanced design, the power plant will achieve the lowest possible air emissions. 
Teesside Renewable Energy Plant
The other important project for the power industry services segment during Fiscal 2021 was the Teesside Renewable Energy Plant (“TeesREP”), which is located in the northeast region of England. TeesREP is a 299 MW biomass-fueled power station that will burn primarily wood pellets in order to generate electricity sufficient to power 600,000 homes. APC is a major subcontractor on this project, responsible for the mechanical installation of the boiler. The plant will be one of the largest bio-mass-fueled power stations in the world. Substantial completion of the TeesREP project is currently scheduled to occur during the summer of 2021 although APC’s work is expected to end during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.
Two years ago, we explained that this construction project was behind the schedule originally established for the job and warned that the TeesREP project could continue to impact our consolidated operating results negatively until it reached completion. APC’s estimates of the unfavorable financial impacts on forecasted costs of the numerous and unique difficulties on this particular project had escalated substantially from the initial estimates prepared for this project. By January 31, 2020, we expected that the total loss on this subcontract would approximate $33.6 million. 
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, APC and its customer, the engineering, procurement and construction services contractor on the TeesREP project, agreed to amend operational and commercial terms for the completion of the project. At the time, this framework addressed the project schedule, payment terms, the scope of the remaining effort, performance guarantees and other terms and conditions for APC to reach substantial completion of its portion of the total project. Although this negotiation returned a meaningful amount of stability to the continuation of the project efforts, the amendment did not resolve significant past commercial differences.
Construction on the TeesREP project was suspended on March 24, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of the work suspension, APC had completed approximately 90% of its subcontracted work. In connection with resuming its efforts on the TeesREP project, APC entered into an amendment to the subcontract, effective June 1, 2020, covering new terms and conditions for completion of the installation of the boiler (“Amendment No. 2”). This amendment represented a global settlement of past commercial differences with both parties making significant concessions, and converted the billing arrangement for the remaining work to a time-and-materials based scheme. During October 2020, APC and its customer agreed to additional contractual changes that effectively recognized APC’s completion of the single performance obligation, that eliminated any uncertainty regarding APC earning certain cost and schedule incentives included in Amendment No. 2 and that established a time-and-materials contractual arrangement covering the additional works that are being requested by APC’s customer until completion of the power plant construction. APC thereby reduced the financial risks associated with the subcontract even further.

The negotiated changes to the contractual arrangements for the TeesREP project and the redirected efforts of the top management of APC and the project team resulted in the reduction of the final amount of the loss incurred on the fixed-price portion of the TeesREP subcontract from $33.6 million to $29.5 million. The project activities being conducted by APC under the time and materials arrangement have been and continue to be profitable.
Major Customer Contracts
At January 31, 2021, the project backlog for this reporting segment was approximately $0.8 billion. The comparable backlog amount as of January 31, 2020 was approximately $1.3 billion. Our reported amount of project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded to us that we consider to be firm as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding projects (project backlog is larger than the value of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, or RUPO, on active contracts; see Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Cancellations or reductions may occur that would reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. 
Typically, we include the total value of EPC services and other major construction contracts in project backlog when we receive a corresponding notice to proceed from the project owner. However, we may include the value of an EPC services contract prior to the receipt of a notice to proceed if we believe that it is probable that the project will commence within a reasonable timeframe, among other factors. Projects that are awarded to us may remain included in our backlog for extended periods of time as customers experience project delays. For example, in March 2018, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to build a 500 MW natural gas-fired power plant that was added to project backlog at that time. However, due to customer delays including a grid connection dispute, contract activities have not yet started and we removed this project, the NTE Reidsville Energy Center, from project backlog during Fiscal 2021.
A substantial amount of the project backlog amount at January 31, 2021 was represented by the Guernsey Power Station. The ramp-up of activity on this project since August 2019 has favorably impacted our quarterly consolidated operating results since then with its increasing revenues.
In January 2020, GPS entered into an EPC services contract with Harrison Power, LLC (“Harrison Power”) to construct a 1,085 MW natural gas-fired power plant in the Village of Cadiz, Harrison County, Ohio. The project is being developed by EmberClear, the parent company of Harrison Power. On March 12, 2020, we announced that GPS had entered into an EPC services contract with NTE Connecticut, LLC to construct the Killingly Energy Center, a 650 MW natural gas-fired power plant, in Killingly, Connecticut. The facility is being developed by NTE Energy, LLC. We anticipate adding the value of each of these new contracts to project backlog at times closer to their financial close and expected start dates. We are cautiously optimistic that the start of construction activities for these projects will occur over the next twelve months. However, we cannot predict with certainty when the projects will commence. The start dates for construction are generally controlled by the project owners.
In May 2019, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to construct a 625 MW power plant in Harrison County, West Virginia. Caithness is partnered with ESC Harrison County Power, LLC to develop this project. As a limited notice to proceed with certain preliminary activities was received from the owner of this project at the time, the value of the contract was added to our project backlog. However, meaningful construction activities for the facility are not likely to begin until financial close is achieved which may not occur before January 31, 2022.
As announced in Fiscal 2019, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to construct the Chickahominy Power Station, a 1,740 MW natural gas-fired power plant, in Charles City County, Virginia. Even though we have been providing financial and technical support to the project development effort through a consolidated VIE and significant project development milestones have been achieved, we have not included the value of this contract in our project backlog. Due to several factors that have interrupted the pace of the development of this project, including additional costs and time being required to secure the natural gas supply for the plant and to obtain the necessary equity financing, we currently cannot predict when construction will commence, if at all. 
In March 2020, we announced that GPS had entered into an EPC services contract to construct the Brooke County Power plant, a 920 MW natural gas-fired power generation facility planned for Brooke County, West Virginia. The project owner announced cancellation of the project in October 2020, citing changing conditions in the energy and financial markets. The value of this project had not been added to our project backlog.

The aggregate rated electrical output amount for the natural gas-fired power plants for which we have signed EPC services contracts, including the Guernsey Power Station, is approximately 6.4 gigawatts with an aggregate initial contract value of approximately $3.0 billion and an aggregate unrealized contract value of approximately $2.7 billion as of January 31, 2021. In addition, we are in the advanced stages of negotiations with a number of new customers for the awards of new but smaller projects, in particular renewable projects as identified below and overseas projects.
We believe that it is important to note that the owners of two of our contracted natural gas-fired power plant projects have plans to integrate green hydrogen solution packages developed by a major gas turbine manufacturer. While the plants will initially burn natural gas alone, it is planned by the respective project owners that the plants will eventually burn a mixture of natural gas and green hydrogen, thereby establishing power-generation flexibility for these plants.
Despite our commitment to the construction of state-of-the-art, natural gas-fired power plants as important elements of our country’s electricity-generation mix in the future, we are directing business development efforts to winning projects for the erection of utility-scale wind farms and solar fields and for the construction of other renewable energy projects. We have successfully completed these types of projects in the past and we are renewing efforts to obtain new work in the renewable power sector that will complement our natural gas-fired EPC services projects going forward. Recently, GPS began exclusive negotiations with the owners of several significant renewable projects for which we expect to begin EPC services contract activities during Fiscal 2022. 
Special Purpose Entities
We selectively participate in power plant project development and related financing activities 1) to maintain a proprietary pipeline for future EPC services contract opportunities, 2) to secure exclusive rights to EPC contracts, and 3) to generate profits through interest income and project development success fees. 
EPC contractors in our industry also periodically execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of completing a project or program for a project owner. These special purpose entities are generally dissolved upon completion of the corresponding project or program. 
In January 2018, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of a VIE that is performing the project development activities related to the construction of the Chickahominy Power Station. The account balances of the VIE are included in the consolidated financial statements, including development costs incurred by the VIE during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, which are included in the balances for property, plant and equipment as of January 31, 2021 and 2020 in the amounts of $7.5 million and $6.9 million, respectively.
Materials and Labor
In connection with the engineering and construction of traditional power plants, biodiesel plants and other renewable energy systems, we procure materials for installation on our various projects. We are not dependent upon any one source for major equipment components, like heat recovery steam generation units, steam turbines and air-cooled condensers, or any other construction materials that we use to complete a particular power project. In general, we have not experienced significantly harmful schedule delays related to the procurement or delivery of the necessary materials for our major projects in the past.
With our assistance, project owners frequently procure and supply certain major components of the power plants such as state-of-the-art natural gas turbines. We have significant experience in delivering EPC projects with the latest turbine technology and working with all three major gas-fired turbine manufacturers to meet each project owner’s specific power plant requirements. EPC project requirements may vary considerably. Our personnel possess the skills and experience needed to overcome the plant design, development and construction challenges presented by each EPC services project, thereby steadily eliminating uncertainties throughout the development lifecycle and construction phases of each project.
We perform work on job sites in different states and countries. The skilled craft labor pool is unique in each region due to a variety of factors, including union versus non-union work environments, competing infrastructure projects located nearby our sites that utilize the same labor pool as us, and decreased and aging labor pools resulting from demographic trends. As such, we take a carefully considered and tailored approach at each job site to acquire and retain the required personnel resources when we need them, especially craft labor, and to maintain optimum productivity on each of our projects. Depending on the project, we may utilize direct hires, subcontractors, existing internal personnel, or a combination of the

three. To date, we have managed to staff each of our jobs safely and effectively. However, in staffing each new project with the skilled craft labor needed to complete the job successfully, we may be challenged by labor shortages in the construction industry, rising wages, demographic trends and other factors.
We sourced certain supplies, materials and equipment from countries stricken by the COVID-19 pandemic, as did certain of the major original equipment manufacturers for major components of natural gas-fired power plants. Disruptions to these supply chains, or the supply and productivity of labor at job sites, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our schedules, and may ultimately affect our ability to complete our large fixed-price contract projects in accordance with original schedules. We believe that we have protections in our contracts with major customers that provide certain relief that helps to mitigate certain financial risks. These protections could be limited depending on the underlying issues and the financial challenges of our customers. We have actively attempted to manage these risks during this period of uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the COVID-19 outbreak. The extent of the operational and financial impacts on us probably will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions prove to be. As we go forward, there may be unscheduled delays in the delivery of materials and equipment ordered by us or a project owner or other unanticipated challenges to our ability to complete major job tasks when planned, among other impacts, none of which are quantifiable at this time.
The costs of materials needed for the completion of our projects may fluctuate from time to time. In times of increased volatility similar to those being experienced currently, we take steps to reduce our risks. For example, we may hold quotes related to materials in our industrial fabrication and field services segment for only three days. For major fixed price contracts in our power industry services segment, we may mitigate material cost risks by procuring the majority of the equipment and construction supplies during the early phases of a project. During Fiscal 2021, the profitability of our active jobs did not suffer meaningfully from the global surge in material costs. 
Competition
GPS competes with large and well capitalized private and public firms in the construction and engineering services industry, including two of the largest construction firms in the country, Bechtel Corporation and Kiewit Corporation and other global firms providing engineering, procurement, construction and project management services. These and other competitors are multi-billion-dollar companies that may have thousands of employees. We also may compete with regional construction services companies in the markets where planned projects might be located. Typically, a condition for award is that the contractor perform on a fixed-price or lump-sum contract basis; smaller elements of a contract may be billable on an allowance or cost-reimbursable basis. As explained below, there are risks of unrecovered costs, among other features, associated with these types of contracts.
To compete with these firms, we emphasize our proven track record as a value-add choice for the design, build and commissioning of natural gas-fired and alternative energy power systems. Our successful experience includes the efficient completion of natural gas-fired combined cycle and simple cycle power plants, wood/coal-fired plants, waste-to-energy plants, wind farms, solar fields and biofuel processing facilities, all performed on an EPC contract basis. Through the power industry services segment, we provide a full range of competitively priced development, consulting, engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management and maintenance services to project owners. We are able to react quickly to their requirements while bringing a strong, experienced team to help navigate through difficult technical, scheduling and construction issues. We believe that the cultures of GPS and APC encourage motivated, creative, high energy and customer-focused teams that deliver results. Our projects are directed by dedicated on-site project management teams and our project owner customers have direct access to our senior management at these companies. 
APC also competes regularly with much bigger, more well-established companies for larger projects. These companies include the John Wood Group PLC and METKA, the sustainable engineering solutions business unit of Mytilineos S.A.
The competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plant construction has changed significantly over the last several years. While the market remains dynamic, we are moving into an era where there may be fewer competitors for new gas-fired power plant EPC services project opportunities. Several major competitors have exited the market for a variety of reasons or have been acquired. Others have announced intentions to avoid entering into fixed-price contracts.

Nonetheless, fixed-price contracting has continued to occur due to intense competition that has increased the bargaining power of project owners and sustained the number of projects typically completed on a fixed-price basis. Competition has led to aggressive bidding on projects while certain contractors have accepted greater risks associated with the inability to anticipate unforeseen issues and the failure to include adequate contingencies to cover lower-than expected labor productivity, unfavorable execution challenges and unusual weather events, for example. As a result, construction and engineering companies have incurred losses related to performance on fixed-price contracts, including some of the largest firms in the country.
We are not immune to these risks. As identified above and described more fully in later sections of this report, we incurred a loss in connection with the performance of the fixed price portion of our TeesREP subcontract in the final amount of $29.5 million. We are pleased to report that the efforts of the project team and the performance of assigned tasks under the new time and materials arrangement have resulted in additional reductions to the expected loss on this project. Nonetheless, we try to be particularly selective in pursuing new project opportunities and will be reluctant to enter into fixed-price contracts that represent high risk profiles. The track record of GPS has proven that fixed-price contracts can provide opportunities for higher margins if the corresponding projects are completed at lower-than-planned costs. We are confident that our project management teams have gained the experience necessary for successful execution on these types of contracts as we go forward although we are aware of the risks involved.
Customers
For Fiscal 2021, our most significant power industry services customer was Guernsey Power Station LLC, the owner of the Guernsey Power Station project, which accounted for approximately 67% of our consolidated revenues for the year.
For Fiscal 2020, the Company’s most significant power industry services customers were the owner of the Guernsey Power Station project and Técnicas Reunidas UK Limited, APC’s customer on the TeesREP project, which is the loss project referenced above, located in Teesside, England. Each customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues and together they represented 37% of consolidated revenues for the year.
For Fiscal 2019, the Company’s most significant power industry services customers were Exelon West Medway II; Moxie Freedom LLC; TR and NTE Carolinas LLC, each of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues and which together represented 51% of consolidated revenues for the year.
Regulation
Our power industry services operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations including: licensing for contractors; building codes; permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; and special bidding, procurement and employee compensation requirements. Many state and local regulations governing construction require permits and licenses to be held by individuals who have passed an examination or met other requirements. We believe that we have all the licenses required to conduct our current operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
The power plants that we build, and other energy facilities including the pipelines required to supply natural gas fuel to them, are also subject to a myriad of federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental protection, air quality, water quality and noise and height restrictions. The growing preference for renewable energy sources and the elimination of fossil-fueled power plants by the populations of the US and the UK may result in such restrictions becoming more severe in the future. The consequences may result in fewer gas-fired power plants being constructed in the future than are currently forecast.
Relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, local and national government health agencies in the US, the UK and Ireland may continue to issue increasingly onerous restrictions on places and/or events where people may gather in close proximity to others. We do believe that our office-based employees can continue to work effectively on a remote basis if necessary, for extended periods of time. However, such restrictions could severely hamper our abilities to conduct construction activities on job-sites, or could shut-down such sites completely.

Industrial Fabrication and Field Services
TRC was founded in 1977 and is located near Greenville, North Carolina. TRC is principally an industrial field services provider and pipe and vessel fabricator for industrial organizations primarily in the southeast region of the US. Its facilities include two metal fabrication plants and support structures.
TRC operates within its own reportable business segment, industrial field services and fabrication. Its major customers include large fertilizer companies such as Nutrien Ltd.; a gold-mining company located in South Carolina, OceanaGold Corporation; a world leading supplier of industrial gases, Air Liquide S.A.; North America’s largest forest products companies such as Weyerhaeuser Company and Domtar Corporation; and various petrochemical companies. For Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, TRC reported revenues of $65.3 million, $94.7 million and $101.7 million, respectively, or approximately 17%, 40% and 21% of consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
Historically, TRC was a profitable company that incurred a pre-acquisition net loss in 2015, primarily due to it taking on large contracts before the acquisition that resulted in significant losses. With our financial support and the substantial completion of these loss contracts, we acquired TRC with the belief that it was positioned to succeed in the future with a return to profitable operations. Significant efforts have been expended since the acquisition to sustain a financial turnaround with growing revenues and profitable operating results. While we have been encouraged with TRC’s ability to achieve positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for each of the past five years of operations, the financial performance of TRC has been uneven and not as profitable as we would like. Since the acquisition, we provided TRC with an additional $31.5 million in cash so that it could fund the completion of the work on the loss contracts in progress on the date of the acquisition, enhance working capital in support of business growth and stability, acquire capital equipment to assure efficient and competitive fabrication and field operations and support other general corporate needs. A substantial amount of this cash was provided in the year period following the acquisition. However, no cash has been advanced to TRC since May 2019. In fact, since then, TRC has returned $16.5 million in cash to Argan (over 50% of the total amount advanced), including $10.0 million during Fiscal 2021. 
While the latest business valuation of TRC did not result in a goodwill impairment loss for Fiscal 2021, the uneven operating results of TRC have resulted in a series of prior year goodwill impairment losses. The originally established balance of the goodwill of TRC, $14.4 million, has been written down to a net balance of $9.5 million as of January 31, 2021. 
The impacts of COVID-19 did result in delays in certain contract awards and project starts which resulted in revenue shortfalls for Fiscal 2021. However, effective business development efforts have rebuilt the project backlog of TRC from $14.0 million as of January 31, 2020 to $54.0 million as of January 31, 2021, and have resulted in meaningful additions to project backlog subsequent to year-end.
Telecommunications Infrastructure Services
SMC represents our telecommunications infrastructure services reportable business segment and conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, which provides comprehensive technology wiring and utility construction solutions to customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. We perform both outside and inside plant cabling.
Services provided to our outside premises customers include trenchless directional boring and excavation for underground communication and power networks, aerial cabling services, and the installation of buried cable, high and low voltage electric lines, and private area outdoor lighting systems. The outside premises services are primarily provided to state and local government agencies, regional communications service providers, electric utilities and other commercial customers. The wide range of inside premises wiring services that we provide to our customers include the structuring, cabling, terminations and connectivity that provide the physical transport for high-speed data, voice, video and security networks. These services are provided primarily to federal government facilities, including cleared facilities, on a direct and subcontract basis. Such facilities typically require regular upgrades to their wiring systems in order to accommodate improvements in security, telecommunications and network capabilities.
Consistently, a major portion of SMC’s revenue-producing activity each year is performed pursuant to task or work orders issued under master agreements with SMC’s major customers such as DXC Technology Company and Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, a local electricity cooperative. Over the last three years, other major customers have included counties and municipalities located in Maryland; certain state government agencies in Maryland; and technology-oriented 

- 9 -



government contracting firms in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The revenues of SMC were $7.6 million, $8.6 million and $12.7 million for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, or approximately 2%, 3% and 3% of our consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively.
SMC operates in the fragmented and competitive telecommunication and infrastructure services industry. We compete with providers ranging from regional companies to larger firms servicing multiple regions, as well as large national and multi-national contractors. We believe that we compete favorably with the other companies in our market space by emphasizing our high-quality reputation, outstanding customer base, security-cleared personnel and highly motivated work force in competing for larger and more diverse contracts. Based on its reputation and quality performance, SMC was selected on a sole source basis to perform outside premises and structured cabling work at several secure overseas locations during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019.
Employees
The total number of personnel employed by us is subject to the volume of construction in progress and the relative amount of work performed by subcontractors. We had approximately 1,473 employees at January 31, 2021, substantially all of whom were full-time. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
Financing Arrangements
We have financing arrangements with Bank of America (the “Bank”) that are described in an Amended Replacement Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), dated May 15, 2017. The Credit Agreement provides a revolving loan with a maximum borrowing amount of $50.0 million that is available until May 31, 2021, with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.0%. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover other credit instruments issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. At January 31, 2021, the Company had credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but no borrowings, in the approximate amount of $1.8 million. We have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Company expects that it will negotiate either an extension or a replacement agreement prior to the current expiration date of the Credit Agreement.
The Bank’s consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank requires that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each of our fiscal quarter-ends. The Credit Agreement includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature. As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We believe we will continue to comply with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. 
In support of the current project development activities of the active VIE discussed above, the Bank issued a letter of credit in the approximate amount of $3.4 million, outside of the scope of the Credit Agreement, for which we have provided cash collateral.
Safety, Risk Management, Insurance and Performance Bonds
We are committed to ensuring that the employees of each of our businesses perform their work in a safe environment. We regularly communicate with our employees to promote safety and to instill safe work habits. GPS, APC, TRC and SMC each have an experienced full-time safety director committed to ensuring a safe work place, as well as compliance with applicable permits, insurance and local and environmental laws. Our OSHA reportable incident rates, weighted by hours worked for all of our subsidiaries, were 0.55, 0.40 and 0.54 for calendar years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively; our rates were significantly better than the national average rates in our industry (NAICS – 2379) for those years.
We retain qualified insurance brokerage assistance in the regular evaluation of the adequacy of insurance coverage amounts and the annual negotiation of premium amounts in the areas of property and casualty insurance, general liability, umbrella coverage, director and officer insurance and other specialty coverages. We believe that our insurance coverage amounts are adequate, but not excessive, and provide the proper amounts of coverage where we believe insurable risks may exist.
Contracts with customers in each of our reportable business segments may require performance bonds or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance. We maintain material amounts of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and, as indicated above, we have the commitment of the Bank to issue irrevocable standby letters of 

- 10 -

Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Matters
Our on-going commitment to environmental, health and safety, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, sustainability, and other public policy matters relevant to us is being supported by the ESG subcommittee of our board of directors, which was formed in Fiscal 2021.

We are pleased to summarize our ESG accomplishments over the past two years which include the following:

While our pro-active efforts varied depending on the particular job or office location, and other factors including the severity of the outbreak, we implemented a number of different safety measures, including COVID-19 testing onsite at a major job site, remote work, staggered shifts in various offices, contract tracing and quarantines.
