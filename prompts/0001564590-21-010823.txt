Overview
 We are a research and clinical development biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing unmet medical needs in disorders of the complement and coagulation systems. Proteases are the natural regulators of these biological systems. We engineer proteases to create both improved or novel molecules to treat diseases that result from dysregulation of the complement and coagulation cascades. Our protease engineering platform has generated two late-stage clinical programs including marzeptacog alfa (activated) (“MarzAA”), a subcutaneously (“SQ”) administered next-generation engineered coagulation Factor VIIa (“FVIIa”) for the treatment of episodic bleeding in subjects with rare bleeding disorders. Our complement pipeline includes a preclinical program partnered with Biogen International GmbH (“Biogen”) for dry age-related macular degeneration (“AMD”), an improved complement factor I protease for SQ prophylaxis in patients with complement factor I (“CFI”) deficiency and C4b-degraders designed to target disorders of the classical complement pathway as well as other complement programs in development.
 The product candidates generated by our protease engineering platform have improved functional properties such as longer half-life, improved specificity, higher potency and increased bioavailability. These characteristics potentially allow for improved efficacy, SQ administration of recombinant coagulation factors and complement inhibitors, or less frequently dosed intravitreal therapeutics.
 Our most advanced product candidate is MarzAA, a next-generation SQ FVIIa that is entering a registrational Phase 3 trial (MAA-304) in patients with Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. We also plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial of MarzAA in Factor VII Deficiency, Glanzmann Thrombasthenia, and Hemophilia A with inhibitor patients on prophylaxis Hemlibra for treatment of episodic bleeding (MAA-202).
 Our complement portfolio is led by the development candidates CB 4332 and CB 2782-PEG. CB 4332 is a wholly-owned first-in-class improved CFI intended for lifelong prophylactic SQ administration in individuals with CFI deficiency. CB 2782-PEG is a potential best-in-class C3 degrader product candidate in preclinical development for the treatment of dry AMD that we have licensed to Biogen. We have several engineered protease programs in discovery or early non-clinical development. These programs all target diseases caused by deficient regulation of the complement system.
 Our next most advanced hemophilia product candidate is dalcinonacog alfa (“DalcA”), a next-generation SQ FIX, which has shown efficacy and safety in a Phase 2b clinical trial in individuals with Hemophilia B. We have a discovery stage Factor IX gene therapy construct, CB 2679d-GT for Hemophilia B, that has demonstrated superiority compared with the Padua FIX variant in preclinical models.

The following table summarizes our current development programs.
 

Both MarzAA and DalcA have received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and in the European Union (“E.U.”); MarzAA, for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with Hemophilia A and B with inhibitors, and DalcA, for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes for Hemophilia B patients. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has granted Fast Track designation for MarzAA for the treatment of episodic bleeding in patients with Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B with inhibitors. We control worldwide development, manufacturing and commercialization rights of both MarzAA and DalcA, except for the commercialization rights of DalcA in South Korea. We estimate the global market opportunity for MarzAA and DalcA to be approximately $4.0 billion: $2.2 billion for the Factor VIIa market and $1.8 billion for the Factor IX (“FIX”) market.
 In the CB 4332, enhanced CFI program, we intend to commence enrollment of an observational trial in mid-2021 to assess CFI activity and genotype patients who have diseases related to CFI deficiency in order to identify those who would benefit from CB 4332 treatment. This will prepare us for a P1/2 clinical study of CB 4332 in 2022. CB 4332 is intended to restore the missing physiological complement regulation in patients with absent, low or aberrant CFI. There are currently no approved options for protein replacement therapy in CFI deficiency, nor are there any in clinical development. We estimate that the market for CB 4332 in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (“aHUS”), complement 3 glomerulopathy (“C3G”) and immune complex mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (“IC-MPGN”) is approximately $500 million, with additional potential opportunities for patients who are CFI deficient with indications outside of nephrology, such as to prevent severe infections and recurrent inflammatory histopathologies. The size of the market for these potential opportunities is estimated to be approximately $12.0 billion by 2026. This patient population is likely significantly underdiagnosed and appears to be growing as more awareness about the clinical manifestation of complete CFI deficiency emerge. There are a number of dry AMD patients who have genetic abnormalities in their CFI gene that may be an important driver of their disease.
 Additionally, we are currently developing a portfolio of next generation specific complement degraders based on CB 4332 and designed to target disorders of the classical or alternative pathways.
 There are currently no approved drugs for treating dry AMD. Dry AMD is estimated to have a $5.0 billion market opportunity which could grow to over $18.0 billion by 2028 with no approved drugs on the market. We entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Biogen (“Biogen Agreement”) in late 2019 for the development and commercialization of CB 2782-PEG. We received a $15.0 million upfront payment from Biogen in 
 6


January 2020 and are eligible to receive up to $340.0 million in milestone payments and tiered royalties for worldwide net sales of this product candidate up to low double-digits.
 We are experiencing operational and other challenges as a result of the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) global pandemic, which have delayed our enrollment in MAA-304 and MAA-202, and which may delay or halt our development in our programs. See the section entitled “Risk Factors” for further discussion of the current and expected impact on our business and development programs.
 Hemostasis 
 Background on Hemophilia. Hemophilia is a rare and serious bleeding disorder that results from a genetic or an acquired deficiency of a factor required for normal blood coagulation. There are two major types of hemophilia: Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B, caused by abnormalities in coagulation Factor VIII or Factor IX, respectively. Deficiencies in these factors reduce the ability of the affected individuals to form clots and stop bleeding. The disease is X chromosome-linked, meaning that most people who inherit the disorder and suffer from bleeding are male; however, female carriers of mutations in Factor VIII or Factor IX can also have reduced coagulation factor levels and resultant bleeding. Hemophilia A occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 male births, and Hemophilia B in approximately 1 in 20,000 male births. The estimated number of patients with hemophilia worldwide is 1.1 million, of whom 418,000 are estimated to have severe hemophilia. The prevalence of severe Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B in the United States is approximately 20,000 patients. Patients with hemophilia suffer from spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes that can become limb- or life-threatening. In cases of severe hemophilia, spontaneous bleeding into muscles or joints is frequent and often results in disabling irreversible joint damage. Currently there is no cure for hemophilia.
 Hemophilia Management and Opportunities for a New Paradigm with SQ Therapy. Current hemophilia treatments involve on-demand management of acute bleeding episodes or prophylactic treatment using factor replacement or bypassing therapy. Replacement therapy involves frequent IV administration of the missing factors to prevent or stop bleeding. IV infusion is invasive, painful, time consuming and particularly challenging to administer to children. Often times, patients must seek assistance of a health professional for the IV infusion.
 Another significant challenge in managing patients with hemophilia is the risk for development of inhibitors, which are neutralizing anti-drug-antibodies (“nAbs”) that reduce the efficacy of the factor replacement. This occurs in approximately 30% of Hemophilia A and 5-10% of Hemophilia B patients. Inhibitor patients must be treated with bypassing agents to achieve coagulation in the absence of effective factor levels.
 Currently, two types of IV bypassing treatments exist: recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa: NovoSeven RT and SEVENFACT) and activated prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g., FEIBA). rFVIIa is currently the leading bypassing agent for on-demand treatment in inhibitor complicated hemophilia. rFVIIa has proven effective in multiple rare bleeding disorders, including Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, Severe Factor VII Deficiency, Glanzmann Thrombasthenia, and Acquired Hemophilia A. NovoSeven RT sales for 2019 were $1.2 billion. FEIBA is also administered for acute bleeding but its effect is reduced by the need for frequent dosing and the risk of anaphylaxis and renal side effects in Hemophilia B with inhibitor patients. All of these bypassing agents are administered intravenously, making them cumbersome to administer and have relatively short half-lives, often requiring multiple infusions to treat a bleed. Although FEIBA is approved for prophylaxis, it must be administered by IV infusion every other day and the rFVIIa products are generally not used for routine prophylaxis.
 We believe SQ dosing is the future for the treatment of hemophilia and other rare benign hematology indications. Our nonclinical and clinical studies have shown that MarzAA is nine-fold more potent than NovoSeven RT and that DalcA is 22-fold more potent than BeneFIX. The enhanced potency of MarzAA and DalcA allows for SQ dosing using a small volume, which we believe will provide for more effective, durable and convenient treatments of spontaneous bleeds with MarzAA and prophylactic protection with MarzAA and DalcA, especially for children and adults with difficult IV access. In late 2018 Hemlibra®, a bispecific antibody mimicking FVIIIa, was approved for SQ prophylaxis in Hemophilia A with or without inhibitors but Hemlibra cannot treat breakthrough bleeding.

MarzAA Clinical Development. We are initiating a registrational Phase 3 trial (MAA-304) for our most advanced product candidate, MarzAA, a potent, subcutaneously administered, next-generation Factor VIIa variant.
 The development program began with a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MarzAA administered IV in patients with severe Hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated that single IV administration of doses of MarzAA ranging from 0.5 µg/kg/day to 30 µg/kg/day were safe and well tolerated. Moreover, there was a dose dependent increase in MarzAA antigen and activity levels with normalization of coagulation parameters at the higher dose levels.
 In 2019, we successfully completed a Phase 2 open-label SQ prophylaxis trial that met all primary and secondary end points. The Phase 2 trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of MarzAA in preventing bleeding episodes. The primary endpoint assessed the effect of MarzAA on the annualized bleed rate (“ABR”) at a subject’s final dose level, with each patient’s prior 6-month ABR serving as his own control. The secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability and lack of anti-drug-antibody or neutralizing antibody formation. Daily SQ administration for 50 days at an individual’s final dose of MarzAA significantly reduced the mean 6-month pre-study ABR from 19.8 to 1.6 during treatment (p<0.01). Additionally, the Proportion of Days with Bleeding (“PDB”), was significantly reduced from a 6-month pre-treatment mean of 12.3% to 0.8% during treatment (p<0.01). The median ABR and PDB were both reduced to zero during treatment, with seven of nine subjects experiencing no bleeds, either traumatic or spontaneous, at their final dose level. Subcutaneous treatment with MarzAA demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated. No anti-drug antibodies or inhibitors to MarzAA or thrombotic events were detected after administration of a total of 517 SQ doses. Subcutaneous administration prolonged the half-life of MarzAA to 16.6 hours so that trough levels of MarzAA before the next SQ dose are projected to be sufficient to provide bleed prevention.
 We completed a Phase 1/2 PK/PD study (MAA-102) in 2020, to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ascending single dose levels of MarzAA and twice and thrice dosing of 60 µg/kg at 3-hourly intervals in individuals with Hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. The purpose of the trial was to determine if the timing and peak levels achieved were sufficient to treat episodic or breakthrough bleeding with SQ dosing and determine if increasing dose levels resulted in dose proportional pharmacokinetics. This trial, together with population pharmacokinetic simulations and preclinical studies of spontaneous joint bleeding, confirm that we have optimized dosing for the registrational Phase 3 trial (MAA-304). We reported final data from the trial at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in July 2020, which demonstrated that MarzAA reaches target levels estimated to effectively treat episodic and breakthrough bleeds. In addition to prophylaxis efficacy in patients, multiple preclinical studies suggest that MarzAA has the potential to be used for treatment of episodic bleeding and supports further clinical testing to assess effectiveness to achieve hemostasis in the treatment of bleeding events in individuals with hemophilia with inhibitors or for other conditions.
 Across all clinical studies we have treated a total of 46 subjects ranging from single IV to 44-97 days of daily SQ with no MarzAA anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) detected and an ISR rate of <1%.
 In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had granted Fast Track designation for MarzAA. The Fast Track program is designed to facilitate and expedite the development and review of drug candidates that have demonstrated the potential to address an unmet medical need in treating serious diseases or conditions. A drug candidate with Fast Track designation is eligible for greater access to the FDA as well as a priority review and rolling review of the marketing application. We believe the FDA Fast Track designation validates MarzAA’s potential to improve patient care. As the only SQ delivered therapy in development for on-demand treatment of bleeding events, MarzAA is uniquely positioned to become an important addition to the treatment landscape.
 The Phase 3 registration trial (MAA-304) is an open-label, global, multi-center, randomized, cross-over study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MarzAA for on-demand treatment of spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes, in adolescents and adults with congenital Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, compared with Standard of Care, either IV rFVIIa or IV FEIBA. The study will enroll approximately 60 subjects to treat 244 eligible bleeding episodes with each treatment. The primary endpoint is hemostatic efficacy using a standard 4-point assessment scale at the 24-hour timepoint. The study will assess the effectiveness of SQ MarzAA, using up to three doses to treat a bleeding episode, compared with the Standard of Care. We plan to submit our first report to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) in 2021 and our final DSMB report in the middle of 2022.

We also plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial (MAA-202) of MarzAA for treatment of bleeding in Factor VII Deficiency, Glanzmann Thrombasthenia, and in individuals with Hemophilia A with inhibitors treated with Hemlibra in 2021 and to report interim PK data mid-year.
 

Interplay of On-demand Treatment of Bleed and Prophylaxis for Hemophilia Management. Our preclinical data has shown that SQ injections of MarzAA given one minute after injury, to mirror on-demand therapy, significantly reduced bleeding in animal models of Hemophilia A. In mice, reduction of bleeding after SQ administration of MarzAA was as efficient as NovoSeven RT administered IV. Moreover, bleeding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner when MarzAA was given 15 minutes prior to the injury. Moreover, SQ MarzAA was efficacious as a stand-alone therapy for treating spontaneous bleeding in rats and dogs with congenital Hemophilia A. Rats and dogs with hemophilia A present with spontaneous unprovoked bleeding as is seen in humans with hemophilia. These findings suggest that MarzAA has the potential to be used on-demand by SQ administration for treatment of acute bleeding episodes and supports further clinical testing for on-demand treatment of bleeds in individuals with hemophilia or Factor VII deficiency or other rare bleeding disorders.
 Patients on prophylaxis with Hemlibra or other Factor replacement therapy may experience breakthrough bleeds – bleeding despite preventive treatment – or require additional treatments for certain procedures or surgery. Our preclinical data showed that MarzAA is expected to have a similar safety profile as NovoSeven when used in combination with Hemlibra. Specifically, when tested in vitro by the thrombin-generation assay with Hemophilia A plasma, both MarzAA and NovoSeven were equally effective at triggering blood coagulation at their respective clinically relevant concentrations without overshooting safe levels when combined with Hemlibra. Current therapies used with Hemlibra include FEIBA (a pro-coagulation complex) and NovoSeven. However, the concurrent administration of FEIBA with Hemlibra is associated with increased risk of thrombotic events (when a blood clot forms inside a blood vessel), requiring a boxed warning in the package insert. While NovoSeven is safe in patients on Hemlibra prophylaxis, it is administered by an IV infusion to treat a bleeding event. Ideally, add-on therapy for patients on SQ Hemlibra should be given subcutaneously. We believe MarzAA provides a potential SQ solution to this problem as a SQ rescue therapy for hemophilia patients experiencing breakthrough bleeds while on prophylaxis with SQ agents such as Hemlibra.

Complement. The complement system is a complex enzyme-based defense system depicted in the figure below, developed to protect the body from pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Similar to the coagulation system, the complement system employs a triggering mechanism followed by a cascading system of enzymatic proteins (proteases) that, when functioning properly, ultimately leads to the destruction and removal of the pathogen.

Complement system disorders. Deficient or excessive activation of the complement system may lead to severe disorders, including micro thrombotic, autoimmune, and severe infectious diseases. Complement system disorders can be caused either by defects in the complement system that prevent an appropriate response to threats, or by the lack of complement inhibitor activity, which can cause the complement system to become hyperactive and become self-destructive. Either imbalance can have severe or even fatal consequences in affected individuals. 
 10


Complement Factor I Deficiency and CB 4332. CB 4332 is an engineered version of the CFI protease with an extended half-life that was designed for SQ use in patients with CFI deficiency. Even partial CFI deficiency can lead to several diseases including the following:
 
 
Atypical HemolyticUremic Syndrome(“aHUS”) | aHUS is a severe and life-threatening, ultra-rare disease characterized by chronic uncontrolled complement activation and the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, causing a reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and life-threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart and other vital organs. In aHUS, clots in small vessels are common, and the disease is diagnosed based on a combination of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and kidney impairment followed by testing for complement protein levels and/or aberrant genes. Disease manifestation can occur at any age and is often caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Not all aHUS patients are CFI deficient, however, and a definitive diagnosis of CFI deficiency requires measurement of CFI antigen and/or activity eventually supplemented by genetic testing.
C3 Glomerulonephritis(“C3G”) andImmune ComplexMembranoproliferativeGlomerulonephritis(“IC-MPGN”) | C3G, or Complement 3 Glomerulonephritis and IC-MPGN represent a group of diseases that affects the kidneys caused by a dysregulated complement system. Symptoms of glomerulonephritis are related to a loss of normal kidney function, which includes vital functions such as removing wastes from the body, balancing body fluids, regulating blood pressure, and making the hormones that help make blood platelets and red blood cells. Signs can include blood and excess protein in the urine, edema, gout, infections, high blood pressure, fatigue and reduced alertness, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, difficulty sleeping, dry and itchy skin and muscle cramps. 
Complete CFIDeficiency (“CFID”) | CFID may present with a variety of disease manifestations, such as recurrent invasive infections with encapsulated bacteria, but patients are also at risk for developing noninfectious diseases such as chronic inflammation of the blood vessels of the brain and/or spinal cord. Clinical presentations include invasive bacterial infections, peritonitis, meningitis, cutaneous IgA vasculitis and bacteremia. The heterogenous clinical presentation likely makes the disease significantly underdiagnosed and patients may experience life threatening emergencies that may have severe long-term impact on the quality of life. No real prophylaxis exists and patients often receive lifelong antibiotic treatment, which may cause a range of additional problems. 

 
Currently, there are no therapeutic options approved to specifically replace the deficient CFI protein with a well-functioning CFI to treat these disorders. While not specifically targeting CFI deficiency, eculizumab and ravulizumab are indicated for use in aHUS. Neither eculizumab nor ravulizumab address the root cause of the CFI deficiency; instead, they are designed to prevent the downstream effects of uncontrolled complement activity. Patients with aberrant CFI may therefore still have uncontrolled complement activation downstream of CFI. This may cause deposition of complement proteins, for example, on red blood cells, and some CFI patients may have a worse prognosis than others even when on non-replacement therapy.
 CB 4332 is designed to address this unmet need by providing a therapeutic option that corrects the root problem of these diseases by simple, fast and easy SQ administration. The total US and EU5 market potential in kidney disease caused by CFI deficiency such as aHUS, C3G, and IC-MPGN is estimated to be around $500M with a potential to grow as genetic and complement-specific diagnostics gain more widespread use. Similarly, diagnosis of CFI deficiency can be expected to grow in the future. The size of the market for these potential opportunities is estimated to be approximately $10.0 billion. This would represent a further upside to the market estimate as CFI deficiency may be significantly underdiagnosed at present.
 Diseases of the Classical Complement Pathway. In healthy individuals, the classical complement pathway is triggered by antibody-pathogen interactions. Specifically, antibodies bind to pathogens and mark them as targets for destruction by the complement system. This lets the complement system know that an unwanted pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed and cleared.
 11


In disease, however, the antibody mediated targeting affects an individual’s own cells, and the classical complement system triggers an uncontrolled self-destructive process, which can have dire consequences. This response involves complement proteins C1, C2, and C4, and modulating these factors could potentially treat disorders of the classical complement pathway in a way that leaves the alternative as well as common pathways intact to carry out their normal physiological functions.
 Examples of disorders related to the classical complement pathway for which limited treatment options are available include the following:
 
 
WarmAutoimmuneHemolyticAnemia(“wAIHA”) | wAIHA is a hemolytic anemia where destruction of red blood cells “tagged” by antibodies may cause fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness chest pain, decreased alertness, confusion, transient loss of consciousness and deregulation of heart rate and blood pressure. wAIHA is also associated with an increased risk of blood clots. Even after treatment, approximately 70% are at risk of developing recurrent episodes of hemolysis. The majority of people with wAIHA survive, although mortality rates of about 5% have been reported. Children may develop wAIHA, but it is more common among adults. 
Cold AgglutininDisease (“CAD”) | Similar to wAIHA, CAD is a hemolytic anemia with similar symptoms. CAD is, however, triggered by cold temperatures. In addition to symptoms mentioned above, patients with CAD may have cold and/or discolored feet or hands. CAD can also cause potentially fatal thrombotic events. Current treatments include blood transfusions, steroids or off-label rituximab often requiring patients to have recurring transfusions which may lead to iron overload. CAD can also be seen in association with some cancers. 
GeneralizedMyastheniaGravis (“gMG”) | Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease caused by an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in which the complement system inappropriately attacks receptors in muscles that receive nerve impulses. gMG patients suffer profound muscle weakness throughout the body, resulting in slurred speech, impaired swallowing and choking, double vision, upper and lower extremity weakness, disabling fatigue, shortness of breath due to respiratory muscle weakness and episodes of respiratory failure. In 2017, eculizumab was approved for gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. As described elsewhere in this prospectus supplement, eculizumab does not directly modulate the classical pathway hyperreactivity that is causing the disease.
Guillain-BarréSyndrome(“GBS”) | GBS is a severe disorder where the complement system triggered by an infection also attacks innocent bystander nerve cells resulting in muscle weakness, inability to climb stairs or walk, double vision or inability to move eyes, severe cramp-like pain, lack of bladder control or bowel function as well as impaired ability to breathe. Although most people recover from GBS, the mortality rate has been reported at about 5%. 
AmyotrophicLateralSclerosis(“ALS”) | ALS is a motor neuron disease that can cause symptoms similar to those of gMG. The weakness eventually affects chewing, swallowing, speaking and breathing. People with ALS are also at increased risk for acute inflammation of the lungs, caused by the inhalation of food or stomach contents due to loss of control of the muscles normally preventing this whereas pain is uncommon as is the loss of bladder control and senses. 
Multifocal MotorNeuropathy(“MMN”) | MMN is a rare disease characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, primarily of the arms and legs due to antibody-initiated complement activation. There is often asymmetric muscle weakness in the hands and lower arms as well as cramping, involuntary contractions or twitching, wrist or foot drop and wasting of affected muscles. Men are more frequently affected than women and men tend to be diagnosed at a younger age. 
Systemic LupusErythematosus(“SLE”) | SLE is an autoimmune disorder causing widespread inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs. It can affect the joints, skin, brain, lungs, kidneys, and blood vessels. Accordingly, affected individuals can present with a variety of symptoms including fatigue, skin rashes, fevers, and pain or swelling in the joints. The symptoms may wax and wane and come in “flares” that can be more or less frequent. Other symptoms of SLE can include sun sensitivity, ulcers in the mouth, joint and lung disease, heart and kidney problems, seizures, psychosis, and blood cell and immunological abnormalities. 

 12


 
Lupus Nephritis(“LN”) | LN is a nephritic complication of SLE induced by autoantibody-initiated complement activation in which the symptoms share many similarities with those of other kidney disorders including blood and proteins in the urine, high blood pressure, edema and high levels of creatinine in the blood. Treatment is generally unspecific and may involve immunosuppressants, dialysis, or kidney transplantation.
----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schizophrenia | Schizophrenia is a complex disorder. Growing evidence points to imbalances in the classical pathway, such as C4 hyperreactivity, that may be involved in aberrant pruning of nerve cell interactions. 

 
In general, these disorders have large patient populations. For example, it is estimated that across the US/EU5 markets there are: 32,000 patients with ALS; 76,000 with wAIHA; 129,000 with gMG; 13,000 with GBS; 22,000 with CAD; 4,000 with MMN, and 372,000 and 129,000 with SLE and LN, respectively. Taken together as a whole the classical pathway disorders either have no approved therapies or severe unmet needs exists that if addressed by successful drug candidates could significantly improve patient outcomes and become great commercial successes.
 Catalyst protease programs in complement. We believe that engineered proteases have a unique potential to address disorders driven by dysregulated biological processes and are differentiated by circumventing certain limitations of small molecule and antibody-based therapeutics. Two examples of biological processes/systems that can be targeted by engineered proteases are the coagulation and complement systems. In both systems one protease molecule can modulate tens, hundreds, thousands, or even more target molecules, either activating or inactivating them. This is because a protease therapeutic is not consumed in the process of cleaving or degrading its target. Therefore, smaller amounts of protease-based drug molecules can have a profound impact on biological regulatory pathways. In comparison, small molecule drugs normally only inhibit a single target molecule per drug molecule and antibodies inhibit two at best. Proteases do not have this inherent limitation. Moreover, proteases lend themselves well to half-life extension allowing infrequent and convenient administration.
 We currently have several protease programs in preclinical discovery or early non-clinical development. Common to the programs is that they target diseases caused by deficient regulation of the complement system. One ocular program for dry AMD is partnered with Biogen; the remaining complement programs are focused on systemic complement disorders and are wholly owned by Catalyst. 
 CB 2782-PEG for dry AMD (Biogen collaboration). CB 2782-PEG is an engineered pegylated C3 degrader that we designed with a best-in-class anti-C3 profile for dry AMD. Dry AMD is an ocular disease leading to vision loss and blindness for which there is currently no approved therapies. Complement hyperreactivity plays an important role in dry AMD. Using the protease CB 2782-PEG to degrade C3 allows for the neutralization of C3 activity. It is expected that maintaining low C3 in the eye can significantly slow disease progression in dry AMD in patients who would otherwise lose their vision over time. The global market potential in dry AMD has been estimated to be $8.6 billion which could grow to over $18.0 billion by 2028. In December 2019, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Biogen for the development and commercialization of CB2782-PEG.
 C4b degraders for classical pathway disorders. A key regulation of the classical pathway occurs at the level of C2/C4. Specifically, CFI together with co-factors, cleave and inactivate C4b to appropriately limit the downstream response. However, in diseases of the classical complement pathway, this regulatory step can be overwhelmed by too much upstream activity leading to uncontrolled downstream complement activation, even in people with normal CFI, ultimately resulting in destruction of the patient’s own cells. We are engineering specific and potent C4b degraders to counteract this imbalance to alleviate disease in disorders of classical pathway hyperactivity by engineering an existing regulatory mechanism to become more effective and thereby applicable in individuals with normal CFI levels. By taking this approach we leverage existing biological functions and aim to specifically address fundamental deficiencies in the way current and future antibody and small molecule-based therapeutics work. Our engineered C4b degrader program aims to leverage the same SQ delivery and high-yield production process used for CB 4332. Notably, although we have not chosen a disorder for our first clinical trial with a C4b degrader, the concept is designed to work across disorders of the classical pathway irrespective of the patients CFI genotype.
 Future programs currently in discovery. We have additional early stage complement targeted discovery programs that have not yet been disclosed. The programs target different proteins from C3b and C4b.

Complement intellectual property. The United States Patent and Trademark Offices issued a patent covering Catalyst’s portfolio of engineered proteases that selectively cleave and degrade complement Factor 3 (C3), including the lead candidate CB 2782-PEG, a potential best-in-class treatment for dry AMD currently in development and under a license and collaboration agreement with Biogen. These modified proteases inhibit complement activation and have the potential to treat multiple diseases in which complement activation plays a role. The newly issued patent provides protection until at least 2038. Our portfolio encompasses additional issued IP and pending applications in the complement space across a range of targets and protease scaffolds.
 DalcA Clinical Development. DalcA is a next-generation SQ Factor IX product candidate for the prophylactic treatment of individuals with Hemophilia B, which completed a Phase 2b study in 2020.
 We completed a Phase 1/2 SQ dosing trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of DalcA in patients with severe Hemophilia B in a collaboration with ISU Abxis. The study objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing Factor IX activity levels from approximately 1% (severe hemophilia) to greater than 12% (mild hemophilia corresponding to a reduced risk of spontaneous joint bleeds) with daily SQ injections. DalcA maintained protective Factor IX activity levels of 12-30%. Mild to moderate injection site reactions were reported and all resolved spontaneously without sequelae. Two subjects, who were cousins with the same rare Factor IX mutation, developed nAbs, one transiently. The nAbs were specific to DalcA (did not bind to wild-type Factor IX) and therefore did not interfere with the patients’ ability to resume use of their prior Factor IX therapy. Thus, the nAbs to DalcA are not referred to as inhibitors. We completed a comprehensive investigation of the root cause of the nAbs in 2018 and concluded that the immunogenic potential of DalcA was low and similar to that of commercial Factor IX products. Furthermore, the drug product quality of DalcA was shown to be comparable to commercial Factor IX products.
 In 2020, we completed an open-label Phase 2b study to evaluate the ability of DalcA to maintain steady state protective Factor IX levels above 12% in six individuals with severe hemophilia B. Each subject received a single intravenous dose, followed by daily SQ doses of DalcA for 28 days during which FIX activity levels, clotting parameters, half-life, safety, tolerability and anti-drug antibody formation were monitored.
 At the World Federation of Hemophilia Virtual Summit in June 2020, we reported that 28 days of daily SQ dosing of DalcA at 100 IU/kg achieved protective target FIX levels of >12% in all participants, with FIX levels of up to 27% and a half-life of 2.5 to 5.1 days. No bleeds were reported during the 28 days of dosing and the 5 day wash-out, demonstrating effective prophylaxis and the potential for lower or less frequent dosing. Injection volumes were less than 1 mL. One subject withdrew on day 7 after reporting injection site reactions (“ISR”) from the first 3 SQ doses. No neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were detected, and no serious adverse events were reported. A single non-neutralizing anti-drug antibody to DalcA was observed at the end of study time point and had no clinical effect. Some subjects reported mild ISR of pain and/or redness, primarily with the initial injections. No thrombotic events occurred, and blood coagulation markers did not show any prothrombotic signals. 
 Factor IX Gene Therapy. Our Factor IX gene therapy construct CB 2679d-GT has demonstrated a 2-fold to 3-fold higher activity resulting in improved clotting time and blood loss in a preclinical Hemophilia B mouse model compared with the Padua variant of Factor IX. Fidanacogene elaparvovec (Pfizer/Spark), AMT-061 (uniQure),TAK-748 (Takeda) and FLT180A (Freeline) use the Padua FIX variant as the transgene in their AAV-based gene therapy clinical programs. Fidanacogene elaparvovec, AMT-061 and FLT180A have demonstrated encouraging Factor IX levels in their respective Phase 1/2 and Phase 2/3 studies with median Factor IX activity levels in the upper end of the mild to normal ranges. By its increased activity, CB 2679d-GT has the potential to reach higher Factor IX activity levels at lower vector doses which could improve tolerability of the vector as well as efficacy of the transgene, and ultimately lower manufacturing costs.
 We have licensed AAV technology from The Board of Trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”) and are currently optimizing the vector under a sponsored research agreement with Stanford. Data presented at European Association for Haemophilia and Allied disorders (“EAHAD”) in February 2020 show that the combination of our proprietary potency enhanced CB 2679d-GT Factor IX construct with a novel chimeric AAV capsid may reduce the vector dose required in gene therapy while maintaining high Factor IX levels. We reported at the World Federation of Hemophilia Virtual Summit in June 2020 that studies of CB 2679d-GT in Hemophilia B mice have demonstrated a 4-fold reduction in blood loss and an 8-fold reduction in bleeding time when compared 
 14


with the same dose of the Padua variant of FIX. We also reported that in a non-human primate study evaluating expression and tolerability, CB 2679d-GT in the novel chimeric capsid KP1 was well tolerated with high FIX expression that stabilized to approximately 25% to 50% FIX above baseline levels at the 6-week interim data cutoff. The novel chimeric capsid had differentiated and superior response to anti-capsid neutralizing antibodies compared to that observed for the LK03 comparator during the screening of non-human primates for the study.
 Our Strategy
 We are building a protease medicines company. Our portfolio of engineered protease therapies is designed for individuals with disorders of the complement and coagulation systems who need new or better treatment options. Our overall strategy builds on our belief that proteases can uniquely be engineered to improve their properties as potential drugs, for example by circumventing limitations of small molecule and antibody-based therapies. We are focused on building a portfolio of closely linked, yet highly differentiated drug candidates that leverages the unique attributes of proteases. Key focus areas for us in the near and longer term include:  
Complement Therapeutics:
  
o | Invest in multiple differentiated systemic complement regulation programs with our proprietary protease engineering platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Initiate clinical trial(s) with CB 4332 including an observational trial and a Phase 1/2 trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Advance C4b-degraders and other novel complement programs into clinical development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hemostasis Therapeutics:
  
o | Initiate and complete a registrational Phase 3 trial for the treatment of acute bleeds.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Expand clinical development of MarzAA in additional indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


o | Complete formulation studies of DalcA.
--+---------------------------------------

 Leverage the protease engineering platform to develop novel differentiated therapeutics:
  
o | Focus on rare systemic disorders amenable to engagement by proteases and where clear unmet needs exist.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Engineer drug candidates that have applications across multiple indications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Utilize existing processes across candidates and programs to achieve platform benefits.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Strategically develop candidates with a fast to clinic approach.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


o | Develop therapeutics with infrequent, convenient SQ administration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Collaborations
 MarzAA. In 2009, we licensed MarzAA to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Wyeth”). Wyeth was subsequently acquired by Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) who terminated the license and collaboration agreement after completing a Phase 1 IV trial. Pursuant to the collaboration termination agreement, in exchange for the rights to certain Pfizer technology, we agreed to make payments to Pfizer in an aggregate amount equal to up to $17.5 million, payable upon the achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Following commercialization of any covered product, Pfizer would also receive a single-digit royalty on net product sales on a country-by-country basis for a predefined royalty term. In February 2018, we paid Pfizer a $1.0 million milestone payment based on the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 study.
 15


DalcA. We collaborated with ISU Abxis (“ISU”), in the early development of DalcA. Under the collaboration agreement, ISU conducted the Phase I clinical trial of DalcA and was responsible for all manufacturing activities for the Phase 1 clinical trial. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended in December 2018, ISU is entitled to a low single-digit royalty payment, on a country-by-country basis, for net product sales of DalcA by the Company or its affiliates in each country other than South Korea. ISU is also entitled up to $19.5 million in milestone payments, of which $2.5 million are regulatory and development milestone payments and up to $17.0 million in commercial milestone payments.
 CB2782-PEG. In 2019, we agreed to collaborate with Biogen to develop and commercialize CB 2782-PEG and our other anti-C3 proteases for potential treatment of dry AMD and other disorders. We will perform preclinical and manufacturing activities, and Biogen will be solely responsible for funding the preclinical and manufacturing activities and performing investigational new drug (“IND”)-enabling activities, worldwide clinical development, and commercialization. We received a $15.0 million upfront payment from Biogen in January 2020 and are eligible to receive up to $340.0 million in milestone payments, along with tiered royalties for worldwide net sales of this product candidate up to low double-digits.
 We also collaborated with Mosaic Biosciences (“Mosaic”) in the development of our Complement product candidates including CB 2782-PEG. Under the collaboration agreement, as amended in December 2019, Mosaic will perform all future services for an FTE-based fee. Pursuant to a subsequent amendment in May 2020, Mosaic received a one-time cash payment of $0.8 million and is eligible to receive up to $4.0 million in potential future milestone payments for regulatory and clinical development milestones resulting from the development of CB 2782-PEG and an additional anti-complement product candidate payable in cash or common stock at the Company’s election. As a result, we now own one hundred percent of all future payment streams related to these product candidates.
 Competition
 Our product candidates will face competition from approved therapeutics. Competition for our product candidate pipeline comes primarily from large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, who have greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products. Mergers and acquisitions within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may further concentrate competitors’ resources. We are not only competing with these companies in terms of technology, but also in recruiting and retaining qualified scientists and management personnel, in establishing partnerships with clinical trial sites, and in enrolling individuals into clinical trials.
 In addition to current Standard of Care for individuals, clinical trials are being pursued by several parties in the field of biologics and in our lead indications. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Based on publicly available information, the following are some of the products currently on market or being developed by competitors in indications overlapping with those of our programs.
  
• | Factor VIIa Competition:

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our commercial opportunity in different indications could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are safer, more effective, more convenient to use, or less expensive to use than our products. Furthermore, if competitors gain FDA approval faster than we do, we may be unable to establish a strong market presence or to gain market share. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Intellectual Property
 We have established a broad intellectual property portfolio including patents and patent applications covering the identification, selection, optimization, and manufacture of human proteases, the composition of matter and methods of use of our product candidates and related technology, and other inventions that are important to our business.
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or in conjunction with or in-licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of human protease engineering.
 As more fully described below, as of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio included approximately 72 patents; including 3 issued U.S. patents and 69 foreign granted and accepted patents, and 7 U.S. patent applications, plus an additional 5 pending foreign patent applications. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
  
• | Obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Defend and enforce our patents;
--+--------------------------------


• | Maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18


Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
 In addition, a third-party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
 There may be third party patents or patent applications with claims to compositions of matter, materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. There is a patent family pending in the U.S. and Europe in which claims that may read on MarzAA have been filed. We, however, do not believe such claims are patentable. If they were to issue, we would take appropriate action to challenge their enforceability and/or validity.
 We are aware of a patent family that includes issued patents in the United States, Australia, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Japan, and pending applications in Europe and Canada.  The patents and pending applications may include claims that may read on a contemplated Factor Xa (“FXa”) clinical candidate. There is prior art that we believe discloses subject matter on which a challenge to the patentability of such claims can be based. In the event that development of the FXa candidate is pursued we would, if necessary, consider appropriate action to challenge such claims.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
 All our patents and applications were internally developed and assigned to us, except for two granted South Korean patents that are co-owned. Members of the 4902 family, directed to screening methods (4 patents, including 2 of the issued U.S. patents) are jointly owned with the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, which licensed its interest to us. Our current patents and patent applications include:
  
• | 72 patents, including 3 issued U.S. patents, and 9 patent applications, including 4 pending U.S. patent applications, covering modified Factor VII polypeptides, including our lead product candidate, MarzAA, and methods of production of modified Factor VII polypeptides. The U.S. patents, with patent term adjustment, expire in 2029 and 2031. The foreign patents expire in 2029.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 30 patents, including 4 issued U.S. patents, and 9 patent applications, including 1 U.S. patent application, covering modified Factor IX polypeptides, such as our clinical candidate DalcA, nucleic acid molecules encoding modified Factor IX polypeptides, or therapeutic uses. The U.S. patents and patent applications, including patent term adjustment, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively, in 2030-2031 and 2038, and the foreign patents and patent applications, if granted, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively, in 2031.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | 1 PCT patent application filed and 1 U.S. patent application in progress, covering adeno-associated viral vectors that have increased tropism for hepatocytes and encode modified factor IX polypeptides. The applications, if granted, are expected to expire in 2040.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 63 patents, including 6 issued U.S. patents, and 33 patent applications, including 3 U.S. patent applications, covering novel proteases, nucleic acid molecules encoding novel proteases, or therapeutic uses. The U.S. patents and patent applications, including patent term adjustment, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively in 2025-2029 and 2038-2039, and the foreign patents and foreign patent applications, if granted, expire, or are expected to expire, respectively, in 2025-2027 and 2038-2039.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The term for individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in that country or the international filing date. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date.
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The regulatory review period that occurs after the patent to be extended was issued is eligible to be counted for extension. The extension is calculated as one-half of the time of the testing phase added to time in the approval phase. The testing phase is the period between the effective date of an investigational product exemption (Investigational New Drug Application) and the initial submission of the marketing application (New Drug Application or Biologic License Application). The approval phase is the period between the submission and approval of the marketing application. Extensions can be reduced by any time that the applicant did act not with due diligence as determined by the FDA. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
 In the future, to the extent our product candidates including MarzAA, DalcA, Anti-C3 and systemic complement proteases receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors.
 Manufacturing
 Our team has in-depth knowledge on biologics development, manufacturing and CMC regulatory requirements. We do not have any manufacturing facilities and we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical or commercial uses. We own or have rights to all intellectual property developed in such manufacturing development activities that are specifically related to our product candidates and have a royalty-free and perpetual license to use the intellectual property to the extent reasonably necessary to make our product candidates, including commercial manufacturing. 
Drug Substance manufacturing
 We have a long-term development and manufacturing services agreement with AGC Biologics, Inc. (“AGC”). AGC has global manufacturing sites and we use their facilities in the U.S. and Europe for drug substance manufacturing of MarzAA, DalcA, and CB 2782-PEG. We have successfully manufactured MarzAA to support our global Phase 3 (MAA-304) clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MarzAA for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in subjects with Hemophilia A or Hemophilia B with inhibitors. As of December 2020, we have successfully completed two large-scale GMP batches of MarzAA that will be sufficient to support the Phase 3 clinical trial (MAA-304) through its completion. Additionally, we have entered into a firm purchase commitment, 
 20


with AGC, to validate the MarzAA manufacturing process including production of three Process Performance Qualification batches.
 In January 2020, we completed a successful CMC Scientific Advice meeting with the Paul Ehrlich Institute in the EU which endorsed our current CMC strategy and manufacturing activities required for registration filing for the MarzAA program.
 Drug Product manufacturing
 We have a long-term clinical supply services agreement with Catalent Indiana, LLC (“Catalent”). Catalent has facilities in the U.S. and Europe and conducts drug product development and manufacturing for MarzAA and DalcA. We successfully completed development work for a variety of vial sizes which supports flexible dosing.
 We also work with Symbiosis Pharmaceutical Services Limited on drug product manufacturing for MarzAA on a fee-for-services basis. Symbiosis has a facility in the United Kingdom.  In 2020, two drug product manufacturing batches were successfully completed at Symbiosis to support MarzAA pivotal trials.  
 The two MarzAA drug product batches manufactured at Symbiosis in 2020, were also successfully packaged and labeled at Catalent to support MarzAA clinical trials.  
 Commercialization
 We have yet to establish a sales, marketing, or product distribution infrastructure for our product candidates, which are still in clinical development. We expect to retain commercial rights for our product candidates in the United States except for our anti-C3 dry AMD program, for which we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Biogen to develop and commercialize CB 2782-PEG and other products or compounds that target complement Factor 3 globally. We have also granted ISU rights to commercialize DalcA in South Korea. We believe that it may be possible to access the United States hemophilia market through a focused, specialized sales force. We have not yet developed a commercial hemophilia strategy outside of the United States. 
Government Regulation
 As a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our engineered human protease products will be regulated as biological products. Biological products, including engineered human proteases, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their implementing regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products. 
 FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of a biological product begins and before the marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development, the approval process, or after product approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.

US Biological Products Development Process
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a biologics license application or BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices or GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including an engineered human protease, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs.
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with the manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in 
 22


relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also may be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible such as in rare or orphan diseases like hemophilia. In the case of hemophilia, almost all clinical trials are conducted as open-label single arm trials, in which both the researchers and participants know which treatment is being administered and there is no placebo or blinded portion of the trial because there are too few subjects available in these orphan populations to perform statistically powered placebo or active comparator trials. Endpoints for on-demand therapies are the number of treatments required to control bleeding episodes and for prophylaxis therapies are the calculated annualized bleeding rates. Bleeding rates during the trial are compared to historic bleeding rates for participating individuals. Patients are often studied for at least 50 treatment days to see if neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (inhibitors) develop.  
 Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the law or the initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 23


US Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biological products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. No user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. MarzAA has been granted orphan drug designation for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with Hemophilia A and B with inhibitors and DalcA has received orphan designation for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes for Hemophilia B patients.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will generally inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 24


If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 The FDA has agreed to certain review goals under PDUFA and aims to complete its review of 90% of standard BLAs within ten months from filing and 90% of priority BLAs within six months from filing. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests, or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides, additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review, Orphan Drug Designation, and Breakthrough Therapy Programs
 Fast Track
 There are several FDA programs intended to help facilitate the development of new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life- threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biological product may request the FDA to designate the drug or biological product as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Under a Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
Priority Review
 A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review to facilitate the review. 
Accelerated Approval
 A product that is being studied for safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 25


Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. These circumstances are an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or a situation in which a new formulation of the drug has shown superior safety or efficacy or a major contribution to patient care. This exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same drug for the same indication.
 MarzAA has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with Hemophilia A and B with inhibitors and for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes in individuals with Hemophilia B with inhibitors in the E.U. DalcA has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and the E.U. for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding episodes for Hemophilia B patients. We may seek orphan drug designation for MarzAA and DalcA for a different indication, or other product candidates, but the FDA may disagree with our analysis of the prevalence of the particular disease or condition or other criteria for designation and refuse to grant orphan status. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain orphan drug designation or approval for any product candidate, or that we will be able to secure orphan drug exclusivity if we do obtain approval.
 Break Through Designation
 A product may also be eligible for receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy designation. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the FDA’s review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases where “preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy provides the same benefits as are available under the Fast Track program, as well as intensive FDA guidance on the product’s development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but they may expedite the development or approval process.
Post-approval Requirements
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products.
 26


We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 Marketing Exclusivity and U.S. Patent Term Restoration
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHS Act to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from accepting biosimilar applications for four years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval and from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. As innovative biological products, we believe that our products would receive this data protection if the FDA approves them for marketing.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity that may apply to biological products approved in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, include the 4- and 12-year periods discussed. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 27


Disclosure of clinical trial information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biological products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act (“ACA” to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 28


HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 To distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party 
 29


payors include federal and state healthcare programs, privately managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list,  also known as a formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product.  This is also true of Medicare reimbursement, where different vendors process payments, so that coverage by one vendor does not assure that all other vendors will provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.  In addition, the United States federal government position on matters related to drug pricing is evolving and uncertain, and any changes could have a material impact on drug pricing generally in the United States, including for our product candidates if approved.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom also requires consideration of cost-benefit analysis. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third- party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws 
 30


and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on its business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect its future operations.
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
