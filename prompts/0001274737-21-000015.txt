Item 1. Business
Company Overview 
Exagen is dedicated to transforming the care continuum for patients suffering from debilitating and chronic autoimmune diseases by enabling timely differential diagnosis and optimizing therapeutic intervention. We have developed and are commercializing a portfolio of innovative testing products under our AVISE® brand, several of which are based on our proprietary Cell-Bound Complement Activation Products, or CB-CAPs, technology. CB-CAPs assess the activation of the complement system, a biological pathway that is widely implicated across many autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. Our goal is to enable rheumatologists to improve care for patients through the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, or RA. Our strategy includes leveraging our portfolio of testing products to market therapeutics through our sales channel, targeting the approximately 5,000 rheumatologists across the United States. Our business model of integrating testing products and therapeutics positions us to offer targeted solutions to rheumatologists and, ultimately, better serve patients. 
We currently market 10 testing products under our AVISE® brand that allow for the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. Our lead testing product, AVISE® CTD, enables differential diagnosis for patients presenting with symptoms indicative of a wide variety of connective tissue diseases, or CTDs, and other related diseases with overlapping symptoms. The comprehensive nature of AVISE® CTD allows for the testing of a number of relevant biomarkers in one convenient blood draw, as opposed to testing serially for individual biomarkers, which adds time and cost to the diagnostic process. We believe AVISE® CTD may provide clinical utility for over 23 million patients in the United States suffering from these diseases, which include SLE, RA, Sjögren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, or APS, other autoimmune-related diseases such as autoimmune thyroid, and other disorders that mimic these diseases, such as fibromyalgia. There is an unmet need for rheumatologists to add clarity in their CTD clinical evaluation, and we believe there is a significant opportunity for our tests that enable the differential diagnosis of these diseases, particularly for potentially life-threatening diseases such as SLE. 
We are leveraging our portfolio of testing products to establish partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, academic research centers and patient advocacy organizations. In December 2018, we entered into a co-promotion agreement, or the Janssen Agreement, with Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, to exclusively promote SIMPONI® (golimumab) in order to advance our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy, and we began direct promotion of SIMPONI® in January 2019. We also have agreements with other leading pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations, including GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK, Covance Inc. and Parexel that leverage our testing products and/or the data generated from such tests. We provide GSK, a leader in lupus therapeutics, our test result data to provide market insight into and help increase awareness of the benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis of SLE and lupus nephritis, and monitoring disease activity. We partner with academic research centers and patient advocacy organizations, such as Brigham and Women's Hospital, Hospital for Special Surgery, and Duke University as well as the Lupus Foundation of America, to help improve the quality of life for people affected by autoimmune diseases through programs of research, education, support and advocacy. We plan to pursue additional partnerships that are synergistic with our evolving portfolio of testing products.
We have demonstrated a strong track record of developing innovative testing products that meet the needs of diagnosing, prognosing and monitoring CTDs, as illustrated below: 
AVISE® CTD leverages our proprietary CB-CAPs technology to enable the differential diagnosis SLE. AVISE® CTD provides rheumatologists and their patients with sensitive and specific results that allow for potentially faster and more accurate differential diagnosis of SLE as compared to other currently-marketed testing methods. Beyond SLE, AVISE® CTD allows rheumatologists to accurately diagnose other overlapping autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including RA, with the same blood sample. 
Our AVISE® SLE Monitor testing product also leverages our proprietary CB-CAPs technology by measuring two CB-CAPs biomarkers that offer insight into a patient’s disease activity. This test is designed to enable rheumatologists to effectively assess and optimize therapeutic intervention in patients diagnosed with SLE. Depending on disease severity, AVISE® SLE Monitor may be utilized by patients multiple times a year throughout their lives. 
We market our AVISE® testing products using our specialized salesforce. Since the launch of AVISE® CTD in 2012 and through December 31, 2020, we have delivered over 487,000 of these tests. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 100,450 AVISE® CTD tests were delivered, representing an approximate 5% decline over the same period in 2019. The number of ordering healthcare providers reached a record of 2,500 for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing approximately 5% growth over the same period in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of ordering healthcare providers reached 1,690 compared to 1,707 in the same period in 2019, and we reached a record 635 adopting healthcare providers (defined as those who previously prescribed at least 11 diagnostic tests in the corresponding period) compared to 572 in the same period in 2019. A high percentage of adopting healthcare providers continue to order tests in subsequent quarters, including a retention rate of approximately 99% among adopting healthcare providers from the third quarter of 2020 that order at least one diagnostic test in the fourth quarter of 2020.
In addition, we continue to populate a growing proprietary database of de-identified patient test results from our clinical studies and our clinical laboratory. We believe the insight emerging from these results has the potential to unlock value for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the development and commercialization of therapeutics. We believe we also have the ability to further leverage our database to optimize patient selection in clinical trials for companies developing therapeutics for autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. We plan to collaborate with our existing and future pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to help maximize the full value of our in-house database. 
We believe our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy differentiates us from other diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, and results in a unique opportunity to promote and sell targeted therapies in patient focused sales calls with rheumatologists, including those with whom we have a longstanding relationship and who have a history using our portfolio of testing products. We intend to leverage our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy to establish additional partnerships.
We are led by an experienced management team with unique capabilities to execute on our strategy of integrating the promotion of testing products and therapeutics. Our senior management has an average of over 20 years of experience in the healthcare industry with a focus on integrating diagnostics and therapeutics. 
Our Strategy 
We develop and commercialize next-generation testing products and promote synergistic therapeutics to ultimately improve the continuum of care for patients suffering from debilitating and chronic autoimmune diseases. The key tenets of our business strategy include: 
▪Continue our track record of developing innovative testing products. Since inception, we have demonstrated a strong track record of developing testing products that address the challenges in the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of patients with autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. We are leveraging our proprietary CB-CAPs and methotrexate polyglutamate, or MTXPG, technologies to develop additional testing products designed to have superior clinical utility for CTDs. We believe our commitment to innovating our portfolio of testing products will further strengthen our relationships with rheumatologists and our value proposition to our existing and future pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners.
▪Drive additional market penetration for our testing products. Our portfolio of testing products enables the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. We have demonstrated a strong track record of commercial growth from our testing products, leveraging our specialized salesforce and expansive network of relationships with rheumatologists across the United States. We believe we are uniquely positioned to continue expanding our commercial presence within the autoimmune disease market and plan to continue to invest in our salesforce in order to achieve the optimal reach and frequency with rheumatologists. This will support our strategy of integrating the promotion of testing products and therapeutics. In addition, we will continue to expand our efforts in the targeted promotion and education of rheumatologists and payors as to the clinical and cost benefits of our testing products. We believe these efforts will position us to capture additional market share for our portfolio of testing products.
▪Integrate the promotion of testing products and therapeutics for autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases and establish additional partnerships. Our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy leverages our sales and marketing efforts, targeting rheumatologists for the commercialization of our testing products to promote therapeutics. In January 2019, we began our exclusive promotion of SIMPONI® in the United States. In addition, we believe our agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations validate our unique value proposition to partners seeking a competitive edge for developing and commercializing therapeutics for autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. We intend to leverage our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy to establish additional partnerships with a focus on the development and commercialization of therapeutics that are synergistic with our testing products.
▪Maintain meaningful margin. We realized an increase to our gross margins beginning in the first quarter of 2020 following the expiration of a 10% annual royalty on our CB-CAPs technology. We believe we are well positioned to maintain meaningful margin through a continued focus on increasing operating leverage through the implementation of certain internal initiatives, such as conducting additional validation and reimbursement oriented clinical studies to facilitate payor coverage of our testing products, capitalizing on our growing reagent purchasing to negotiate improved volume-based pricing and automation in our clinical laboratory to reduce material and labor costs. However, our efforts to maintain a meaningful margin may be partially offset by our ability to generate meaningful co-promotion revenue in 2021.
Autoimmune and Connective Tissue Diseases 
Autoimmune diseases encompass a broad range of serious, chronic and debilitating conditions in which a person’s immune system creates antibodies that mistakenly react against normal healthy tissues causing inflammation and irreversible tissue damage. These antibodies are called autoantibodies and their detection through blood tests can help diagnose, prognose and monitor the course of autoimmune diseases. However, knowing when and which autoantibody to test for is challenging due to the vagueness of symptoms, the unexplained flaring and remission of symptoms, and the many conditions which can mimic autoimmune disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of the conditions causing these overlapping symptoms is critical as an incorrect diagnosis can lead to toxicity from inappropriate medications, irreversible tissue damage and other comorbidities associated with uncontrolled disease. There is no known cause or cure for these chronic conditions and current treatment interventions are targeted at managing symptoms and limiting disease progression. 
CTDs are a sub-category of autoimmune diseases involving inflammation of the joints, tissues and internal organs. Persons with CTDs often present to their rheumatologist with complaints of joint pain, fatigue, unexplained fever, 
inflammation, rash, stiffness and muscle aches. These symptoms overlap among numerous CTDs, including SLE, one of the most severe CTDs and historically difficult to rule out, as well as other autoimmune-related diseases and other disorders that mimic these diseases, such as fibromyalgia. Based on a study we commissioned in 2014, we estimate that there are approximately 23 million undiagnosed patients in the United States who are symptomatic of these conditions and who may benefit from the differential diagnosis of CTDs. Of these patients, we estimate approximately seven million are potentially referable to rheumatologists and would be candidates for an AVISE® CTD test, representing a total addressable market of approximately $3.7 billion, based on the current Medicare allowable reimbursement rate. We estimate the total addressable market for our AVISE® testing products to be approximately $5 billion, based on estimated patient populations, the current Medicare allowable reimbursement rate and testing frequencies. 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
SLE, the most common and severe form of lupus, is a chronic, inflammatory disorder that can damage any part of the body, including the skin, joints and internal organs. The blood of a person afflicted with SLE contains autoantibodies, which are the cause of the inflammation and organ damage and are one indicator of immune system abnormalities. SLE is characterized by a rise in symptoms and/or abnormal laboratory test results. SLE varies in severity, from mild cases to those in which significant and potentially fatal damage occurs to vital organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and lungs. Detection of these autoantibodies can assist rheumatologists in the diagnosis of SLE. Diagnosis of SLE allows rheumatologists to initiate the most appropriate therapy to minimize irreversible organ damage and reduce morbidity and mortality. Current treatment for SLE involves the use of antimalarials, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and biologic agents to prevent or suppress active disease or flares. 
Standard laboratory tests for diagnosing SLE include measuring immunological biomarkers, such as antinuclear antibodies, or ANA, anti-double stranded DNA, or anti-dsDNA, and other autoantibody tests. ANA are a group of autoantibodies produced by a person’s immune system when it fails to adequately distinguish between self and non-self. The ANA test detects these autoantibodies in the blood and is a useful screening tool for SLE and other autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. The vast majority of SLE patients test positive for ANA. However, the high sensitivity of ANA for SLE is counterbalanced by somewhat poor specificity. Sensitivity measures the proportion of patients who are correctly identified as having a particular condition, while specificity measures the proportion of patients who are correctly identified as not having a particular condition. Therefore, the majority of individuals who test positive for ANA do not have SLE. Only approximately 11-13% of individuals with a positive ANA test have SLE. This lack of specificity leads to many inappropriate non-autoimmune referrals to the rheumatologist from primary care physicians. For example, it has been reported that 30% of fibromyalgia patients may test positive for ANA, potentially generating as many as four million inappropriate rheumatology referrals. In addition, a study published in 2012 reported the estimated prevalence of a positive ANA test in the normal, healthy, U.S. population to be 13.8%, or 32 million people, indicating a significant need for a highly-specific test for this disease. 
Anti-dsDNA are autoantibodies that target a person’s double stranded DNA. The anti-dsDNA antibody test is a very specific test for SLE as anti-dsDNA antibodies are rarely found in autoimmune diseases other than SLE. A strongly positive anti-dsDNA antibody test makes it very likely that a person has SLE, although if the test is negative it does not necessarily rule out SLE. Approximately 30-70% of people with SLE have a negative anti-dsDNA antibody test, reaffirming the need for an effective testing product which adds clarity to the rheumatologist’s clinical assessment. 
Activation of the complement system is an integral part of the disease process of SLE. Thus, rheumatologists measure components of the complement system, including serum levels of C3 and C4, to help diagnose SLE and monitor SLE disease activity. In 2012, the Systemic Lupus Collaborating Clinics added low C3 and low C4 as immunologic criteria for classifying SLE. In active SLE, C3 and C4 complement proteins are consumed and broken down to fragments, known as complement activation products. Therefore, low levels of C3 and C4 suggest a diagnosis of SLE and that the disease is active. However, variability in the levels of C3 and C4 can occur due to factors unrelated to SLE disease presence or disease activity, making them less reliable as biomarkers for SLE. For example, C3 and C4 are acute phase reactants and produced during inflammation. As a result, many SLE patients have normal complement levels even when the disease is active. Although relatively specific for SLE, low complement levels can also be seen in certain chronic infections, including non-lupus related kidney inflammation, severe liver disease and other autoimmune diseases. CB-CAPs are formed when the fragments of complement activation products from C4 bind permanently to circulating cells such as red blood cells, b-cells and platelets. This binding lasts for the life of the cell and represents a more stable and reliable indicator of complement activation than measuring C3 and C4 alone. 
In March 2011, the first new biologic targeting treatment of SLE in over 50 years, GSK’s Benlysta®, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and in December 2020, the FDA approved this biologic drug 
for the treatment of lupus nephritis. It is the only approved biologic for the treatment of active, antibody-positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy, and in December 2020, the FDA approved this biologic for the treatment of adult patients with active lupus nephritis who are receiving standard therapy. Since Benlysta®'s approval, there have been a number of drug development programs that have failed in SLE, which may suggest that guidelines for classifying SLE patients and the endpoints used to determine clinical effectiveness have not adequately addressed the complexity of the disease process and its heterogeneous population. We believe biopharmaceutical companies would benefit from the differential diagnosis enabled by our AVISE® testing products in order to better identify sub-populations of SLE patients for targeted therapies. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the joints and can also affect other organ systems. The annual incidence and prevalence of RA in the United States is estimated to be 75,000 and 1.75 million, respectively. Patients suffering from RA develop joint damage that is associated with painful inflammation which often progresses to irreversible damage of cartilage and bone leading to significant disability and a reduction in quality of life and the ability to work. Early diagnosis and effective treatment of RA is critically important to prevent erosive bone or joint damage and disability. Rheumatologists are compelled to reach a definitive diagnosis quickly and administer effective treatment. 
Diagnosis of RA involves performing a complete medical history with physical and/or radiographic examination of the number and distribution of swollen, tender and painful joints that have persisted for more than six weeks. Laboratory testing for rheumatoid factor, or RF, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, or CCP, antibodies, and testing for general, nonspecific inflammation with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or the ESR, and C-reactive protein tests are used to assist in the diagnosis. 
The standard of care for the treatment for RA involves the use of Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs, or DMARDs, which have shown, in clinical studies, the ability to slow or stop disease progression. Methotrexate remains the most commonly used DMARD, due to its low cost, effectiveness, and the extensive clinical experience with its use. It is estimated that approximately 74% of RA patients in the United States, or 1.3 million patients, are treated with methotrexate, either as a monotherapy or in combination with another DMARD. 
Biologics DMARDs are proteins that have been genetically modified to target cellular components of the immune system that attack healthy tissues causing the symptoms of RA. They are a targeted form of therapy, which makes them different from traditional RA treatments, such as methotrexate. The first FDA approved biologics for RA were the anti-TNFs. ENBREL® was approved for RA in 1998 and the latest, SIMPONI®, was approved in 2009. The anti-TNFs dominate the therapy for RA and generally are the first biologics chosen to augment methotrexate when patients are not achieving a satisfactory response. 
Our Solution 
We currently market 10 testing products under our AVISE® brand that allow for the differential diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, including SLE and RA. Our product portfolio integrates our proprietary CB-CAPs technology, which is a stable and reliable method for differentially diagnosing SLE. We are focused on leveraging our portfolio of testing products to co-promote therapeutics with existing partners and future partners through our sales channel targeting the approximately 5,000 rheumatologists across the United States. 
Our Proprietary Technologies 
We have two core proprietary technologies, CB-CAPs and MTXPGs, which form the backbone of several of our testing products. 
CB-CAPs 
Our proprietary CB-CAPs technology determines the blood levels of complement activation proteins permanently deposited on hematopoietic cells. The determination of complement proteins in a patient’s blood is a mainstay in clinical laboratory science, and state-of-the-art methods traditionally rely on measurement of serum or plasma levels of soluble complements. C3 and C4 are the most commonly determined complement proteins in the blood and the precursors to activation of complement proteins into biologically active breakdown products. However, there are limitations with measuring C3 and C4 blood levels as indicators of complement activation. For example, increased synthesis of C3 and C4 by the liver can offset increased C3 and C4 breakdown during activation of the complement cascade, resulting in no change in serum levels. While the limitations and drawbacks of measuring standard 
components of the complement system, such as C3 and C4, are well recognized by the medical community, these laboratory biomarkers are part of international guidelines for the classification of SLE. 
We believe the availability of novel complement biomarkers supporting or replacing standard C3 and C4 measures will be of great value for rheumatologists and ultimately their patients. Our CB-CAPs technology directly measures protein products of complement activation, such as C4d, the product of C4 activation. These complement activation products become stably attached to surfaces of circulating blood cells to become CB-CAPs. As such, the determination of CB-CAPs in the blood provides benefits when compared to the traditional complement measurement. These include the stable, accurate and unequivocal information of complement activation that enable consistent measurement and an improved ability to assess and monitor changes in biological activity related to activation of the complement system. In a head-to-head study published in 2014, CB-CAPs (EC4d or BC4d) showed 22% higher sensitivity (66%) than C3 and C4 (44%) in diagnosing SLE, with specificity fixed at 91%. 
MTXPGs 
Methotrexate is the standard of care and first-line treatment of many autoimmune diseases including RA and psoriatic arthritis. Our proprietary technology measures blood levels of MTXPGs, which are the active metabolite of methotrexate. The technology uses a dried capillary blood-based collection method coupled with liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry and quantifies nanomolar concentrations of MTXPG using at least two orders of magnitude lower blood volume than venipuncture. MTXPG blood levels are actionable clinical utility checkpoints and can help clinicians identify causes for a lack of response to methotrexate, such as poor activation to active metabolites, underexposure secondary to poor absorption or poor compliance, all of which are limiting factors to the achievement of a robust clinical response with this first-line treatment. We believe we can leverage this technology to optimize anti-TNF treatment by reducing the formation of anti-drug antibodies that are known to impact the clinical efficacy of these drugs. 
Testing Products 
Since inception, we have been committed to developing and commercializing innovative testing products that address the challenges rheumatologists face in differentially diagnosing, prognosing and monitoring complex autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. We estimate the total addressable market for our AVISE® testing products to be approximately $5 billion, based on estimated patient populations, the current Medicare allowable reimbursement rate and testing frequencies. 
Diagnosis 
AVISE® CTD 
Our lead testing product, AVISE® CTD, is a comprehensive test that aids in the differential diagnosis of SLE versus other common CTDs. The SLE portion of the test employs our proprietary CB-CAPs technology and specifically measures activation of the complement system by quantifying the level of two CB-CAPs biomarkers in the patient’s blood, B-cell C4d, or BC4d, and erythrocyte bound C4d, or EC4d, which are higher in patients with SLE compared to patients with other CTDs. In addition, the comprehensive nature of AVISE® CTD enables testing for a series of biomarkers (23 as of December 31, 2020) in one convenient blood draw to further aid in the differential diagnosis of a wide variety of CTDs and other diseases which can be challenging to diagnose as a result of overlapping symptoms. These diseases include SLE, RA, Sjögren’s syndrome, APS, other autoimmune-related diseases such as autoimmune thyroid, and other disorders that mimic these diseases, such as fibromyalgia. Our test’s ability to allow rheumatologists to effectively rule out SLE and differentially diagnose other CTDs such as RA adds clarity to the rheumatologist’s assessment, thereby making the evaluation process more efficient and accurate. The clinical performance of our proprietary biomarkers and the convenience of a single blood draw make AVISE® CTD an attractive choice among rheumatologists.
AVISE® Lupus 
The AVISE® Lupus test employs our proprietary CB-CAPs technology and is the cornerstone of the SLE assessment within our more comprehensive AVISE® CTD testing product. AVISE® Lupus measures activation of the complement system by quantifying the level of BC4d and EC4d in the patient’s blood. Rheumatologists choose to order the comprehensive AVISE® CTD test or the more focused AVISE® Lupus test based on medical necessity, which is determined by each patient’s symptoms and medical history. 
AVISE® APS 
AVISE® APS consists of a specialized panel of eight autoantibody tests. This test aids in both the diagnosis and management of APS, a hyper-coagulation state leading to thrombosis, pregnancy complications, and even death. Rheumatologists would typically request the AVISE® APS test in patients who initially tested positive for one or more APS biomarkers contained in AVISE® CTD, or in the management of patients experiencing a high-risk pregnancy.
AVISE® Vasculitis AAV 
In September 2020, we launched AVISE® Vasculitis AAV which utilizes a testing panel of individual analytes designed to provide physicians with rapid and reliable results in the assessment and monitoring of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, or ANCA, associated vasculitis, or AAV. AAV is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by vascular inflammation and damage. Early signs and symptoms vary greatly and are not always indicative of the severity of the disease. Rapid and accurate testing is essential to prevent death and long-term disability. 
Prognosis 
AVISE® SLE Prognostic 
AVISE® SLE Prognostic is a ten-biomarker panel of autoantibodies that have established predictive value for assessing the potential for complications affecting the kidney, brain and cardiovascular system, including lupus nephritis, lupus psychosis, strokes and heart attacks related to lupus. Rheumatologists rely on insights from the AVISE® SLE Prognostic test to help tailor their treatment approach. 
AVISE® Anti-CarP 
AVISE® Anti-CarP, which measures anti-carbamylated protein antibody, or anti-CarP, was developed by the Leiden University Medical Center, and we introduced it as a biomarker-driven RA prognostic test through a distribution agreement with Inova Diagnostics, Inc. with the goal of identifying patients prone to more severe disease. We were the first commercial laboratory to make testing for anti-CarP available in the United States with the introduction of AVISE® Anti-CarP in 2018. This test uniquely addresses two major challenges facing rheumatologists today – (1) patients presenting with RA symptoms but lacking the common confirmatory blood tests for anti-RF or anti-CCP, known as sero-negative patients, and (2) the lack of a serologic indicator, which indicates a poor prognosis and helps guide treatment decisions. Anti-CarP can be positive in up to 26% of RA patients who are negative for anti-CCP. Furthermore, RA patients positive for Anti-CarP have an increased risk for more severe RA disease, including permanent joint damage.
AVISE® PC4d 
AVISE® PC4d, introduced in 2018, reflects over 10 years of research efforts and employs our proprietary CB-CAPs technology. This proprietary CB-CAP biomarker measures platelet- bound C4d, or PC4d, and has been shown in clinical studies to have significant association with thrombosis and ischemic stroke in SLE. These thrombotic events can be among the most damaging and deadly forms of lupus flares and often strike without warning. Because of its strong association with thrombosis, we believe AVISE® PC4d promises to be a valuable tool for SLE disease monitoring. 
Monitoring 
AVISE® SLE Monitor
AVISE® SLE Monitor is a six-biomarker blood test that employs our proprietary CB-CAPs technology and is intended to assess the condition of a patient that has been diagnosed with SLE. It offers a unique combination of biomarkers that measure for EC4d, which has shown greater accuracy in tracking disease activity than C3 and C4, and PC4d, which is associated with thrombosis risk in SLE. AVISE® SLE Monitor offers additional insight into a patient’s disease activity as well as possible adverse events. Rheumatologists have limited methods for evaluating the extent of disease activity taking place inside the body of an SLE patient. They rely on imperfect biomarkers, overt symptoms or flares, and patient reported history, all of which leave the rheumatologists looking for greater insights. In surveys conducted with SLE patients, it has been reported that patients tend to under report their symptoms and over 70% of healthcare providers are unaware of this bias. AVISE® SLE Monitor demonstrates correlation to SLE disease activity and is therefore designed to enable rheumatologists to effectively assess and optimize therapeutic intervention in patients diagnosed with SLE. Additionally, AVISE® SLE Monitor measures EC4d, anti-C1q, C3, C4 and anti-dsDNA which can assist physicians with managing their lupus nephritis patients. Depending on disease severity, our AVISE® SLE Monitor testing product may be utilized by patients multiple times a year and throughout their lives. We believe AVISE® SLE Monitor will play an increasingly important role in the management of SLE patients and further solidify the role and relationship of AVISE® testing products for these patients. 
In the first quarter of 2021, physicians will have the option to obtain complete blood counts with differential (CBC+diff) and serum creatinine and C-reactive protein measurements for their patients along with their AVISE® SLE Monitor test order.
AVISE® MTX 
AVISE® MTX is a patented and validated blood test that precisely measures blood levels of MTXPG, the active metabolite of methotrexate linked to disease control in RA patients. There is large variability in the way patients absorb and metabolize methotrexate, leaving rheumatologists unsure of what steps to take when a patient has an inadequate response. Methotrexate is the most widely prescribed drug by rheumatologists in the treatment of RA. Measuring MTXPGs allows rheumatologists to identify patients presenting with inadequate exposure to methotrexate enabling them to optimize dosing and achieve therapeutic levels commensurate with adequate disease control. When faced with a patient who is not responding to methotrexate therapy, the options include increasing the dose, switching to a parenteral delivery method and/or advancing to a more costly biologic therapy. AVISE® MTX provides crucial information as to whether a patient has achieved MTXPG blood levels consistent with an appropriate response to methotrexate, also known as the therapeutic level, or if the MTXPG blood levels are too low to produce adequate effects. The rheumatologists can then make informed therapeutic decisions to optimize methotrexate therapy and give patients their best chance at achieving an optimal response. 
AVISE® MTX is compatible with AVISE® Touch, our low-volume test sample collection method that allows for a micro-volume blood sample to be collected anywhere from a simple fingerstick. AVISE® Touch has a number of advantages, including empowering rheumatologists to collect and submit samples without full phlebotomy services, convenience for patients who have trouble with venipuncture and potential patient self-collection. 
AVISE® HCQ 
AVISE® HCQ is a blood test designed to help rheumatologists objectively monitor levels of hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ, in whole blood as they treat patients with SLE and other CTDs, including RA. HCQ is typically prescribed to patients to control SLE disease activity and prevent flares. However, there is large variability in the response to HCQ therapy, the drug can sometimes take weeks or months to have a therapeutic effect and compliance has been documented to be an issue in CTD patients. We believe measuring HCQ makes the patient accountable, and also helps to determine whether HCQ blood levels are adequate and consistent with clinical efficacy. The addition of new and costly biologic therapies approved for the treatment of SLE may drive interest by all healthcare stakeholders, especially payors, to adopt an approach that optimizes a generic drug before advancing to a costlier alternative. AVISE® HCQ is also compatible with AVISE® Touch. 
Test Reports 
We provide the results of our AVISE® testing products in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand test report typically sent to rheumatologists within five business days following receipt of the blood specimen. As shown below, the result of the AVISE® Lupus portion of the AVISE® CTD report displays a gradient illustrating the likelihood of the presence of lupus, which facilitates interpretation and discussion of the result with the patient versus only reporting a numerical value. In addition, all biomarker results for AVISE® CTD are reported and organized by disease state, providing clarity and convenience for the rheumatologists. A sample of the full AVISE® CTD report is shown below: 
AVISE® CTD Report 
Therapeutics 
In December 2018, we entered into the Janssen Agreement to exclusively promote SIMPONI® in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe RA and for other indicated rheumatic diseases, and we began direct promotion of SIMPONI® to rheumatologists with our specialized salesforce in January 2019. We believe our salesforce allows us to reach the approximately 5,000 rheumatologists in the United States. Additionally, we believe that educating providers regarding SIMPONI® has and will continue to facilitate greater acceptance of SIMPONI®. 
Our AVISE® MTX test can identify methotrexate patients with inadequate methotrexate exposure who are potential candidates for SIMPONI® therapy. Our AVISE® Anti-CarP test can identify RA patients with more severe disease requiring more aggressive therapy, such as anti-TNF biologics like SIMPONI®. We believe our strategy of integrating the promotion of testing products and therapeutics, combined with our specialized salesforce, uniquely position us to expand SIMPONI®’s U.S. market share. We recognized co-promotional revenue of approximately $5.1 million and $1.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For more information regarding the Janssen Agreement, including predetermined baselines and minimum promotion fee levels for 2021, see “—Agreements with Pharmaceutical Companies.” 
In recent years, advancements in the understanding of the autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease process have led to a significant number of novel biologic drugs and drug development initiatives, especially in RA and SLE, and we intend to leverage our integrated testing and therapeutics strategy to establish additional partnerships with a focus on the development and commercialization of therapeutics that are synergistic with our testing products. 
Our Pipeline and Growth Opportunities 
In December 2019, we formed a Scientific Advisory Board consisting of national experts in the clinical management of rheumatic autoimmune diseases including RA and lupus to help guide the organization’s leadership team on the design and execution of research projects as well as weigh-in on known and anticipated advances in technologies affecting clinical management of autoimmune diseases. We believe there is significant potential to capitalize on our proprietary CB-CAPs and MTXPG technologies by integrating those technologies with commercially validated biomarkers to develop testing products with superior clinical utility. The complement pathway is widely implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of conditions, including autoimmune diseases and organ transplant rejection, and emerging data suggests its implication in cancer development. We believe that our proprietary CB-CAPs technology, owing to its stability and reliability, will allow us to produce meaningful and differentiated proprietary solutions for rheumatologists. For example, we are focused on leveraging our proprietary CB-CAPs technology by developing a thrombosis risk score with PC4d in prognosing cardiovascular events in SLE. In addition, we are developing a panel of assays that we believe may have high diagnostic and/or prognostic value in patients with fibromyalgia, RA, Sjögren’s and myositis, and we continue to evaluate the use of AVISE® Touch and microfluidics for our broader portfolio of testing products to increase convenience and cost-effectiveness. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our specialized salesforce is focused on targeting the approximately 5,000 rheumatologists across the United States. Our sales representatives generally have extensive experience in healthcare sales with backgrounds in rheumatology, biologics, specialty therapeutics and/or testing. In addition, our sales representatives complete a comprehensive disease-level sales training program and are required to participate in regular, ongoing training activities and certifications. 
Our sales model involves integrating the promotion of testing products and therapeutics in a unique approach that will enable our sales representatives to gain greater access and time with rheumatologists. The test information available to our sales representatives creates a different dynamic as compared to a traditional drug sales representative’s product detail. It enables a timely, extended, patient-focused discussion that naturally transitions to a therapeutic discussion during the same sales call. Our goal is for our sales representative to be viewed as a collaborative consultant versus a traditional drug sales representative. We intend to capitalize on our established reputation, market presence and expertise to sell additional products and services into the autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease market. We believe that a collaborative relationship with rheumatologists helps build a lasting sales channel through which additional products and services can be introduced. 
As of December 31, 2020, our overall sales team consisted of approximately 66 members. We have a salesforce of 53 representatives, who are managed by a team of seven regional sales directors. Our salesforce is organized into seven regions which include, Pacific, Southwest, Midwest, Great Lakes, Southeast, Atlantic and Northeast. As of December 31, 2020, our salesforce was covering a total of 56 territories within the seven regions. We expanded the reach and frequency of our salesforce by adding seven new territories in 2021 for a total of 63 territories, as well as the creation of an inside salesforce to further our reach with rheumatologists in white space, complementing our 
decentralized salesforce and covering vacant territories. In addition, we expect to increase our salesforce in 2021, which is expected to significantly increase the number of sales calls made per year, helping us to cultivate a strong collaborative relationship with rheumatologists through increased interactions. To further support our promotional efforts, we have a centralized, dedicated client services department with a high level of technical training that augments our specialized salesforce and marketing activities and enhances sales efficiency and customer satisfaction by providing personalized customer support. We believe our salesforce allows us to reach the approximately 5,000 rheumatologists in the United States.
Right Doctor, Right Message, Right Frequency 
We believe our sales model of integrating the promotion of testing products and therapeutics will be complemented by our focused “high-touch” selling approach that emphasizes execution in three core areas: targeting, messaging and call frequency. We strategically target the highest-potential practices by utilizing various data sources (e.g., market analytics, demographic data, historical biologic and diagnostic product usage trends). Furthermore, we believe the increased access afforded by our testing products will allow for patient-focused messaging and the increased accuracy of our testing products over current standard of care diagnostic methodologies. Finally, we execute a high-frequency promotional strategy for our top targeted rheumatologists and their office personnel to build knowledge, understanding and retention of the benefits of our testing products. 
We plan to leverage core channels for building awareness and adoption including our participation with multiple patient advocacy organizations, such as the Lupus Foundation of America, or LFA, and medical societies, such as the American College of Rheumatology, or ACR. We have also established strong relationships with multiple rheumatology care management organizations, or super groups, which can be key in influencing favorable reimbursement. Our AVISE® MTX testing product has been included in the clinical guidelines for two of these groups. We believe our experience with advancing a testing product from initial development through clinical adoption differentiates us and uniquely positions us to replicate success with our other testing products. Beyond working with these groups, we intend to continue to augment field selling activity with a balanced marketing mix including print and digital advertising, direct marketing, continuing medical education programs and working with key opinion leaders to support peer-to-peer educational events.
Reimbursement, Clinical Validation and Clinical Utility 
Reimbursement 
We seek reimbursement for our testing products from several sources, including commercial third-party payors, government payors and patients. Payment from commercial third-party payors differs depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payor as a participating provider or do not have a contract and are considered to be an out-of-network provider. When we contract to serve as a participating provider, reimbursements are made pursuant to a percentage of our charges or a negotiated fee schedule amount. Where we are not reimbursed in full, we may elect to appeal the insurer’s underpayment or denial of payment or seek payment from the patient. We continue to focus on expanding coverage among existing contracted providers and achieving coverage with commercial payors, laboratory benefit managers and evidence review organizations. We employ a multi-pronged strategy designed to achieve broad coverage and reimbursement for our AVISE® testing products: 
▪Meet the evidence standards necessary to be consistent with leading clinical guidelines. We believe inclusion in leading clinical guidelines plays a critical role in payors’ coverage decisions. In order to change clinical guidelines, tests must carry a high level of published evidence demonstrating analytical validity, clinical validity, clinical utility and cost effectiveness. When studies with such evidence are published in peer-reviewed journals, the authors of clinical guidelines may assess the level of evidence and determine whether modifying existing guidelines to include new technology is warranted. For example, we previously conducted peer-reviewed, published clinical studies for AVISE® Lupus which helped us secure favorable coverage from various commercial plans. We have conducted, and continue to conduct, clinical validation and clinical utility studies for AVISE® Lupus, which we believe will provide a basis for the ACR White Paper and/or UpToDate to consider inclusion of AVISE® Lupus in their respective guidelines. In the future, we also intend to conduct similar studies in order to develop similar supporting literature with respect to our other testing products.
▪Execute an internal managed care policy and claims adjudication function as part of our core business operations. We employ a team of in-house claims processing and reimbursement specialists who work with patients and payors to obtain maximum reimbursement. In parallel, a managed care team collaborates with our reimbursement specialists to ensure our payor outreach strategy reacts and anticipates the changing needs of our customer base. Our customer service team is an integral part of our reimbursement strategy, working with patients and rheumatologists to navigate the claims process.
▪Cultivate a network of key opinion leaders. Key opinion leaders are able to influence clinical practice by publishing research and determining whether new tests should be integrated into clinical guidelines. We collaborate with key opinion leaders early in the development process to ensure our clinical studies are designed and executed in a way that clearly demonstrates the benefits of our testing products to healthcare providers and payors.
Clinical Validation 
We demonstrated the clinical validity of AVISE® Lupus in a study of 794 patients conducted from 2010 to 2014 across multiple leading academic centers. The primary endpoint of the study was the specificity and sensitivity of AVISE® Lupus compared to common autoantibodies used to diagnose SLE and other CTDs, such as ANA and anti-dsDNA. The final results of this study showed that AVISE® Lupus demonstrated 86% specificity and 80% sensitivity in distinguishing SLE from other CTDs and fibromyalgia, was 33% more specific than ANA (53% specificity/89% sensitivity) and was 48% more sensitive than anti-dsDNA (32% sensitivity/97% specificity). 
We further demonstrated the clinical validity of AVISE® Lupus for detection of probable SLE, or pSLE, in a 246 subject multi-center, prospective, cross-sectional study, first published in the Arthritis & Rheumatology Journal in September 2019. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of AVISE® Lupus and CB-CAPs as a marker of complement activation in patients with pSLE and the usefulness of the AVISE® Lupus test as a predictor of the evolution of pSLE into classified SLE by the ACR criteria. Of the 92 pSLE patients, more pSLE were positive for CB-CAPs (28%) or AVISE® Lupus (40%) than for low complement (9%) at the enrollment visit (p=0.0001, for each) and an AVISE® Lupus index score >0.08 prospectively associated with the development from pSLE to SLE by ACR classification criteria within 18 months (hazard ratio = 3.11, p<0.01).
Clinical Utility 
We have collaborated with both academic and community clinicians to demonstrate the clinical utility of AVISE® Lupus versus standard diagnostic tests in physician diagnosis, impact on patient management decisions, patient reported outcomes and health economics. 
We sponsored a longitudinal, case-control, retrospective review of medical charts in 2016 to assess the value and clinical utility of AVISE® Lupus to rheumatologists. The results of this study were published in the Open Rheumatology Journal in 2016 and suggested that a positive AVISE® Lupus test aids in the diagnosis of SLE versus standard diagnostic tests. 
In early 2018, we initiated CARE for Lupus, a prospective, randomized, multi-site study to assess the performance of AVISE® Lupus versus standard diagnostic laboratory tests, or SDLT. A total of 145 patients were enrolled across 32 sites between July 2017 and December 2018, with 73 patients enrolled in the SDLT group and 72 patients in the AVISE® Lupus group. The CARE study was published in September 2019 in Lupus Science & Medicine. Results showed among patients who tested positive for AVISE® Lupus (n=9), 44% in the AVISE® Lupus group had a higher likelihood of SLE, compared with 9% in the SDLT group (p=0.127), whereas among patients who tested negative for AVISE® Lupus (n=63), 60% in the AVISE® Lupus group had a lower likelihood of SLE, compared with 37% in the SDLT group (p=0.012). In the group of patients randomized to the AVISE® Lupus group, positive test results associated significantly with initiation of prednisone (p=0.03) and a similar trend was observed with HCQ therapy (p=0.11). Finally, in the group of patients randomized to the AVISE® Lupus group, a positive test result associated with an increase in patient-reported outcomes measuring health-related quality of life using five-level EQ-5D, or EQ5D-5L index score, from enrollment to visit 2 (p=0.028), and greater improvements were detectable when compared to the group of patients positive for AVISE® Lupus and randomized to the SDLT arm (p=0.049). 
Healthcare Economics
In October 2020, a study in collaboration with leading health economic experts was published in the journal ACR Open Rheumatology, titled "Evaluation of the Economic Benefit of Earlier Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Diagnosis using a Multivariate Assay Panel (MAP)." This was the first ever evaluation of the economics of diagnosing SLE with AVISE® Lupus (MAP) compared to standard diagnostic laboratory tests in a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 suspected SLE patients. Over the four-year time horizon, AVISE® Lupus demonstrated an estimated total direct cost savings of approximately $2.0 million, or $1,991 per patient. In addition, the year one savings was $655,403, or $655 per eligible patient, with the use of AVISE® Lupus, which aligns with early benefit to health plans looking for savings in the first year. 
The above referenced studies are included in the AVISE® Lupus Dossier. In March 2020, we announced coverage and in-network contract with three California Medical Groups followed by coverage and an in-network agreement 
with TRICARE East Humana Military and Highmark BCBS coverage policy. We anticipate continued coverage determinations and in-network contracting announcements in 2021 and beyond. 
We believe our reimbursement strategy, including establishing the clinical validation, clinical utility and health economics of our testing products will continue to allow us to drive an expansion in reimbursement coverage for our testing products. 
Laboratory Operations 
We perform all of our AVISE® tests in our approximately 8,000 square foot clinical laboratory, which is certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and located in Vista, California. Our laboratory is certified for the performance of high-complexity testing by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, in accordance with CLIA. We are approved to offer our products in all 50 states. Our clinical laboratory reports all AVISE® testing product results within five business days. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed the build-out of approximately 2,000 additional square feet to our clinical laboratory. We believe that our existing laboratory facilities are adequate to meet our business needs for at least the next 12 months and that additional laboratory space will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if required. 
Quality Assurance 
Our quality assurance function oversees the quality of our laboratory as well as research and development, client services, billing, sales and marketing operations. We have established oversight for systems implementation and maintenance procedures, document control processes, supplier qualification, preventive or corrective actions, and employee training processes that we believe achieves excellence in operations. We continuously monitor and improve our processes and procedures and believe this high-quality service leads to customer satisfaction and retention.
Competition 
Our principal competition for our AVISE® testing products is traditional methods used by healthcare providers to test patients with CTD like symptoms. Such traditional methods include testing for a broad range of diagnostic, immunology and chemistry biomarkers, such as ANA and anti-dsDNA, and serum complement biomarkers, such as C3 and C4. We also face competition from commercial laboratories, such as Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, ARUP Laboratories, Inc. and the Mayo Clinic, all of which have existing infrastructures to support the commercialization of diagnostic services. Large, multispecialty group medical clinics, health systems and academic medical university-based clinics may provide in-house clinical laboratories offering autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease testing services. Additionally, we compete against regional clinical laboratories providing testing in the autoimmune and autoimmune-related disease field, including Rheumatology Diagnostics Laboratories, Inc. (acquired by Laboratory Corporation of America in June 2020). Other potential competitors include companies that might develop diagnostic or disease or drug monitoring products, such as Myriad Genetics, Inc., Progentec Diagnostics Inc., Scipher Medicine Corporation, Genalyte Inc., Oncimmune plc, DxTerity Diagnostics Inc. and Immunovia AB. In the future, we may also face competition from companies developing new products or technologies. 
Direct competition for the promotion of SIMPONI® includes all other companies with anti-TNF biologics and the marketing companies supporting their distribution and promotion. These products include HUMIRA® from Abbvie Inc., ENBREL® from Amgen Inc., CIMZIA® from UCB, INFLECTRA® from Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, (biosimilar REMICADE®) and RENFLEXIS® from Merck & Co. (biosimilar REMICADE®). Additionally, we are restricted from promoting any other biologic or Janus kinase inhibitor, or JAK inhibitor, used for treatment of indications covered by the Janssen Agreement without Janssen's consent. Additional competitors include companies with other biologic drugs indicated for RA that have significant sales or sales potential. Specifically, these include ORENCIA® from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, ACTEMRA® from Roche Holding AG, or Roche, RITUXAN® from Roche, XELJANZ® from Pfizer, KEVZARA® from Sanofi S.A., RINVOQTM from Abbvie Inc. and OLUMIANT® from Eli Lilly and Company. There are also several late-stage RA drug and biosimilar development programs and several additional RA products that have minimal sales to date or that are indicated for other rheumatic indications competitive to SIMPONI® such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our target market include: quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data; confidence in diagnostic results; safety and efficacy with respect to promoted therapeutics; sales and marketing capabilities; the extent of reimbursement; inclusion in clinical guidelines; cost-effectiveness; and ease of use. 
Many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by rheumatologists and payors as functionally equivalent to our solution or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the list price of our products and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
Agreements with Pharmaceutical Companies 
Janssen Agreement 
In December 2018, we and Janssen entered into the Janssen agreement to co-promote SIMPONI® in the United States. We are responsible for the costs associated with our salesforce over the course of such co-promotion. Janssen is responsible for all other aspects of the commercialization of SIMPONI® under the Janssen agreement. In exchange for our sales and co-promotional services, we are entitled to a quarterly tiered promotion fee ranging from $750 to $1,250 per prescription based on the incremental increase in total prescribed units of SIMPONI® for that quarter over a predetermined baseline for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. The predetermined average baseline for quarters ended March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020 was approximately 29,000 prescribed units per quarter, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. In June 2020, due in part to COVID-19, we amended the Janssen Agreement, pursuant to which the predetermined average baseline for total prescribed units of SIMPONI® for each remaining quarter in 2020, starting with the quarter ending June 30, 2020, was adjusted from approximately 29,000 to approximately 26,000 prescribed units per quarter, and subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. For each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we received a minimum promotion fee of $0.3 million and the fee was capped at 5% above the adjusted predetermined baseline. In December 2020, we further amended the Janssen Agreement, pursuant to which the predetermined average baseline for total prescribed units of SIMPONI® for the quarters ending December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 was adjusted to approximately 28,750 prescribed units per quarter, subject to further adjustment under certain circumstances. For the first and second quarter of 2021, we will be entitled to an amended quarterly tiered promotion fee ranging from $500 to $1,000 per prescription based on the incremental increase in total prescribed units of SIMPONI® for that quarter over the predetermined baseline. We refer to the Janssen Agreement, as amended in June 2020 and December 2020, as the Amended Janssen Agreement. Pursuant to the Amended Janssen Agreement, for each of the first and second quarters of 2021, we will receive a minimum promotion fee of $0.3 million and the fee will be capped at 10% above the adjusted predetermined baseline. We continued to receive a minimum promotion fee of $0.3 million and the fee was capped at 5% above the adjusted predetermined baseline for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The quarterly tiered promotion fee for the remaining term of the Amended Janssen Agreement beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2021 will revert to the terms set forth in the Janssen Agreement prior to the amendment, with no minimum promotion fee and no cap on predetermined baseline units.
The Janssen Agreement expires on December 31, 2021, unless extended by us for an additional 12 months upon 180 days written notice prior to the end of the current term. If we elect to extend the term, the predetermined baseline for 2022 will be subject to future agreement by us and Janssen. Janssen can terminate the agreement at any time for any reason upon 30 days’ notice to us, and we can terminate the agreement for any reason at the end of any calendar quarter upon 30 days’ notice to Janssen. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s default of any of its material obligations under the agreement if such default remains uncured for a specified period of time following receipt of written notice of such default. 
Collaboration Agreement with GSK 
In January 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with GSK, pursuant to which we provide GSK with our test result data to provide market insight into and help increase awareness on the benefits of an early and accurate diagnosis of SLE. The agreement was amended in November 2018 to, among other things, include data from our AVISE® Prognostic and AVISE® HCQ testing products and extend the term of the agreement through December 31, 2019. The agreement was further amended in November 2019 and November 2020 to, among other things, extend the term of the agreement through December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Under the agreement, we are required to deliver weekly de-identified data files to GSK covering all data obtained from the performance of certain AVISE® testing products, subject to applicable requirements under the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, internal policy requirements and other applicable laws. During the term of the agreement, the data we provide to GSK may not be provided, directly or through a third party, to any other pharmaceutical company that is marketing or developing a product for the 
treatment of SLE. GSK made a single upfront payment in exchange for the right to receive the applicable data files. In addition, GSK has agreed to create a joint steering committee to cooperate with us in order to raise awareness and physician support for our AVISE® testing products, including through the development and delivery of approved promotional materials and the implementation of a related training plan for each party’s sales personnel. 
The joint committee will meet at least 120 days prior to the end of the term of the agreement in order to discuss renewal options. Either party may terminate the agreement for breach and, in certain cases, such breach must remain uncured for a certain period of time following receipt of written notice of such breach. In addition, GSK may terminate the agreement immediately if we become insolvent or for convenience upon 60 days’ prior written notice. 
Intellectual Property Overview 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our testing products and services and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, to defend and enforce our patents, to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our testing products and services. 
We are the owner or licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets which protect various aspects of our business. The patent families comprising our patent portfolio are primarily focused on our AVISE® testing products for the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, and are generally directed to CB-CAPs, red blood cell MTXPG exposure assessments, and anti-MCV antibodies. We intend to leverage the intellectual property surrounding our AVISE® testing products as an important component of our business strategy. 
Patent Protection for our AVISE® Testing Products 
Our portfolio of patents and patent applications related to our AVISE® testing products generally relates to three aspects: CB-CAPs, red blood cell MTXPG exposure assessments, and anti-MCV antibodies. The patent families which we believe are important for the protection of AVISE® are summarized below in the section entitled “—License Agreements.” As of February 8, 2021, our portfolio primarily consisted of the following:
CB-CAPs 
We are the exclusive licensee of five patent families related to CB-CAPs technology from the University of Pittsburgh, or UPitt. We expect that these patent families (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,361,517; 7,390,631; 7,585,640; 7,588,905; 8,080,382; and 8,126,654) will expire in 2024 or 2025. A foreign patent corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 7,361,517 has issued in Europe (EP 1,756,571). Foreign patents corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 7,390,631 have issued in Japan (JP 4570872 and JP 4906898). Foreign patents corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 7,585,640 have issued in Australia (AU 2005242719) and Canada (CA 2,564,492). A foreign patent corresponding to U.S. Patent Nos. 7,588,905 and 8,126,654 has issued in Japan (JP 4550051). We also own one issued patent (US 10,132,813), two pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications, a pending PCT application, and a pending U.S. provisional application that relate to our AVISE® Lupus products. Foreign patents corresponding to US 10,132,813 have issued in Europe (EP 2,673,644) and Japan (JP 5,990,542) and Hong Kong (HK112316). In order to manage our foreign filing costs and focus on the U.S. market, we made the decision to cease the prosecution and maintenance of several of our foreign patents and patent applications related to our CB-CAPs technology, including EP 1,432,731; EP 1,618,379; EP 1,635,692; EP 1,745,287; EP 2,214,014; EP 2,216,650, and certain of their corresponding family members.
MTX Exposure Assessment Products and Services 
We are the exclusive licensee of four patents that relate to our AVISE® MTX product and methods for monitoring methotrexate therapy using red blood cell MTXPG exposure assessments. These patents and patent applications are owned by Prometheus and are exclusively licensed to us for all uses except for use in gastrointestinal diseases. These patents include U.S. Patent Nos. 6,921,667; 7,563,590; 7,582,282 and 7,695,908, which are expected to expire between 2023 and 2027. We also are the exclusive licensee of two issued US patents (US 9,261,509 and US 9,822,391) that relate to our AVISE® MTX product. 
Proprietary Rights and Processes 
We may rely, in some circumstances, on proprietary technology and processes (including trade secrets) to protect our technology. However, these can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our proprietary technology and processes may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, or any future collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” 
License Agreements 
Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh 
In August 2011, we entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement with UPitt, to amend and restate the exclusive license agreement we obtained by our purchase of the medical diagnostics division of Cypress Bioscience, Inc., or Cypress, in 2010, or the Cypress Purchase, and to obtain an exclusive license to UPitt’s patent rights in certain inventions, or the UPitt Patent Rights, related to the use of CB-CAPs technology in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases, including certain patents related to our AVISE® testing products. The agreement was amended three times, once in May 2012 to, among other things, limit the territory of the license to the United States and exclude certain foreign patents and applications from the agreement, once in September 2013 to add (1) an additional U.S. patent to the UPitt Patent Rights licensed under the agreement and (2) the field of monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection to the scope of the license, and once in June 2016 to, among other things, clarify the definition of combination products for determining royalties due under the license. 
Under the agreement, we are permitted to make, use and sell products and services utilizing the UPitt Patent Rights in the field of SLE and the field of monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection, and to sublicense such rights. UPitt retained the right to practice under the UPitt Patent Rights and to use such rights for non-commercial education and research purposes. In addition, this agreement is subject to the rights of the United States government, if any, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §200, et seq. Pursuant to this law, the U.S. government may have acquired a nonexclusive, nontransferable, paid up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. government the inventions described in the UPitt Patent Rights throughout the world. 
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we made certain upfront payments to UPitt on the first and second anniversaries of the agreement that increased on the third and subsequent anniversaries of the agreement until the first sale of products or services utilizing the UPitt Patent Rights. We are required to pay UPitt a low single-digit royalty on net sales of products or services utilizing the UPitt Patent Rights sold by us or our affiliates, subject to minimum annual royalty payments and other adjustment in certain circumstances. We also made a $0.2 million milestone payment to UPitt with the achievement of certain levels of net sales which we met in 2014. Our royalty obligations continue for each licensed product or service on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product or service in such country. 
In the event we sublicense any of the UPitt Patent Rights, we are obligated to pay UPitt a low single-digit percentage sublicense royalty on net sales of products or services sold by our sublicensees that utilize the sublicensed UPitt Patent Rights and a low double-digit percentage of all non-royalty sublicensing income received by us.
The agreement requires that we diligently develop and commercialize products that are covered by the UPitt Patent Rights, and we have agreed to meet certain development and commercial milestones. UPitt may terminate the agreement if we fail to meet such milestones. In addition, if we fail to meet a milestone relating to development of the UPitt Patent Rights in the monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection field, UPitt may remove that field from our licensed rights. We are currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. 
We may terminate the agreement upon six months’ written notice to UPitt. UPitt may terminate the agreement in the event of our nonperformance of any of our obligations under the agreement if such nonperformance remains uncured for a certain period of time following our receipt of written notice of such nonperformance or in the event of our insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the UPitt Patent Rights. 
Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh 
We made an economic decision to cease the maintenance and licensing of UPitt Patent Rights outside the United States, which led to such rights returning to UPitt. We subsequently made the determination to re-license these foreign patent rights from UPitt, but at the time of re-licensing these patent rights, a number of the foreign patent rights had permanently lapsed. Accordingly, in September 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with UPitt to obtain an exclusive license to UPitt’s remaining ex-U.S. patent rights in certain inventions, or the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights, related to the use of CB-CAPs technology in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases, including certain patents related to our AVISE® testing products. 
Under the agreement, we are permitted to make, use and sell products and services utilizing the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights in the field of SLE and the field of monitoring of organ transplantation and organ rejection outside of the United States, and to sublicense such rights. UPitt retained the right to practice under the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights and to use such rights for non-commercial education and research purposes. In addition, this agreement is subject to the rights of the U.S. government, if any, as set forth in 35 U.S.C. §200, et seq. 
In consideration for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid an initial license fee to UPitt. We are also required to pay UPitt a low single-digit royalty on net sales of products or services utilizing the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights sold by us or our affiliates, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Our royalty obligations continue for each licensed product or service on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product or service in such country. 
In the event we sublicense any of the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights, we are obligated to pay UPitt a low single-digit percentage sublicense royalty on net sales of products or services sold by our sublicensees that utilize the sublicensed ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights and a low double-digit percentage of all non-royalty sublicensing income received by us. 
The agreement requires that we diligently develop and commercialize products that are covered by the ex-U.S. UPitt Patent Rights, and we have agreed to meet certain commercial milestones. UPitt may terminate the agreement if we fail to meet such milestones. We are currently in compliance with these milestone requirements. 
We may terminate the agreement upon six months’ written notice to UPitt. UPitt may terminate the agreement in the event of our nonperformance of any of our obligations under the agreement if such nonperformance remains uncured for a certain period of time following our receipt of written notice of such nonperformance or in the event of our insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the UPitt Patent Rights.
License Agreement with Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. 
In connection with the Cypress Purchase, we acquired a license agreement, dated September 2007, between Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., or Prometheus, and Proprius Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Proprius, a company which had been previously acquired by Cypress. Pursuant to this agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to Prometheus’s patent rights in certain inventions, or the Prometheus Patent Rights, related to the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases, including certain patents related to our AVISE® testing products and services. This agreement was subsequently amended in October 2013. 
Under the agreement, we are permitted to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the Prometheus Patent Rights and to sublicense such rights; provided, however, that any such sublicenses may only be granted with Prometheus’s consent. We are not permitted to develop or commercialize products utilizing the Prometheus Patent Rights for use in diagnosing or treating any gastrointestinal diseases or to promote any such products to gastroenterologists. Pursuant to the agreement, we are obligated to use reasonable commercial efforts to undertake certain development activities with respect to products utilizing the Prometheus Patent Rights, including the completion of certain clinical studies. In addition, in the event that we do not timely complete these studies or approved substitute studies, we will become obligated to pay to Prometheus a one-time payment of $50,000. 
We are required to make a milestone payment of $2.0 million upon the achievement of certain net sales. In addition, we are required to pay Prometheus tiered royalties in the mid-single-digit range on sales of any products utilizing the Prometheus Patent Rights by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees. Our royalty obligations continue on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration, lapse or invalidation of the last valid claim in a licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product in such country. 
In the event we sublicense any of the Prometheus Patent Rights, we are obligated to pay to Prometheus a fee based on a percentage of sublicense fees received by us, which percentage is in the mid-twenties. In addition, we 
are also required to pay to Prometheus a percentage of the royalty payments we receive from our sublicensees, which may not be less than a certain low single-digit percentage of net sales of products or services sold by our sublicensees that utilize the sublicensed Prometheus Patent Rights, nor more than a certain mid-single digit percentage of such net sales. 
We may unilaterally terminate the agreement for any reason upon 60-days’ written notice to Prometheus. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement if such breach remains uncured for a certain period of time following receipt of written notice of such breach or in the event of the other party’s insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the Prometheus Patent Rights. 
Asset Purchase Agreement with Cypress (Royalty Pharma) and Proprius 
In October 2010, we completed the Cypress Purchase pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Cypress and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Proprius, under which we obtained certain assets related to our AVISE® testing products and services. The agreement was amended six times, once in March 2011 to change certain obligations relating to certain accounts receivable we acquired from Cypress, once in August 2012 to convert a one-time payment obligation to a payment plan over four years with interest, once in February 2013 to convert a one-time contingent milestone payment obligation concerning a CB-CAPs monitoring assay to a payment plan over two years with interest, once in October 2013 to, among other things, provide consent for Exagen to use its IP as collateral on a financing round, once in January 2016 to restate an annual sales milestone, and once in February 2017 to restate specifics of the monitoring assay royalty.
In 2011, Royalty Pharma Collection Trust, or Royalty Pharma, acquired Cypress and became its successor-in-interest under the agreement. In consideration for the acquisition, we made certain initial cash payments to Cypress and we are currently making payments to Royalty Pharma, as a successor-in-interest to Cypress, pursuant to the August 2012 amendment, which payments are subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. Under our agreements with Royalty Pharma, we are required to pay Royalty Pharma a low double-digit royalty on the world wide net sales of CB-CAPs products and a low double-digit royalty on the net sales of certain new products in each case, for a period of eight years, which eight year period expired in January 2020. 
In addition, we are required to make certain one-time contingent milestone payments for two third-party commercial programs, for the launch of a CB-CAPs monitoring assay, and for the achievement of an annual, worldwide net sales level for CB-CAPs products. Our agreement with Royalty Pharma requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the milestones to be achieved. In December 2015, we achieved the specified annual world-wide nets sales of CB-CAPs products which required us to make a $2.0 million milestone payment to Royalty Pharma. We paid the applicable $2.0 million milestone payment in 2016. In February 2017, we amended our agreements with Royalty Pharma relating to the launch of a monitoring product using CB-CAPs technology. As a result of this amendment, a prior obligation to make a one-time payment of $1.0 million upon the launch of a monitoring product incorporating CB-CAPs technology was replaced with an agreement to pay Royalty Pharma a one-time payment of $100,000 upon the launch of such a product, plus a 2.5% royalty based on future cash collections from sales of that product which incorporate the licensed technology. Future royalties under this arrangement are limited to the lesser of $1,200,000 (including the upfront payment of $100,000) or the total royalty earned through January 1, 2024. 
Dr. Thierry Dervieux and De Novo Diagnostics, Inc. 
In September 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Dr. Thierry Dervieux, our former Chief Scientific Officer, and his company De Novo Diagnostics, Inc., under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide (except for Australia and New Zealand) license to Dr. Dervieux’s patent rights and know-how in certain inventions, or the Dervieux Patent Rights, related to the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of diseases, including certain patents related to our AVISE® testing products and services. 
Under the agreement, we are permitted to develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the Dervieux Patent Rights in the human healthcare market, and to sublicense such rights. 
In considerations for the rights granted to us under the agreement, we are required to make milestone payments, up to an aggregate of $600,000, upon achievement of certain sales milestones. In addition, we are required to pay Dr. Dervieux a mid-single-digit royalty on net sales by us or our affiliates of any products utilizing the Dervieux Patent Rights, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. We are also obligated to pay Dr. Dervieux a percentage in the mid-twenties of sublicense fees and royalties received by us. 
The agreement requires that we diligently develop and commercialize products that are covered by the Dervieux Patent Rights, and we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring technology covered by the Dervieux Patent Rights to market as soon as practicable. 
We may unilaterally terminate the agreement upon 12 months’ written notice to Dr. Dervieux. Either party may terminate this agreement in the event of the other party’s nonperformance of any of its obligations under the agreement if such nonperformance remains uncured for a specified period of time following receipt of written notice of such nonperformance or in the event of the other party’s insolvency. Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until the expiration date of the longest-lived patent right included in the Dervieux Patent Rights. 
Regulations 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 
As a clinical reference laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under CLIA, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory tests we perform and to comply with standards applicable to our operations, including test processes, personnel, facilities administration, equipment maintenance, recordkeeping, quality systems and proficiency testing. We must maintain CLIA compliance and certification to be eligible to bill for diagnostic services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. 
We have current certification under CLIA to perform testing at our Vista facility. To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to the testing we perform may change over time, and any such changes could have a material effect on our business. 
Penalties for non-compliance with CLIA requirements include suspension, limitation or revocation of the laboratory’s CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties. 
State Laboratory Licensing 
In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our Vista clinical reference laboratory under California law. Such laws establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical reference laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory. 
Because we receive specimens from New York, our clinical reference laboratory is required to be licensed by New York, under New York laws and regulations, which establish standards for:
▪day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including training and skill levels required of laboratory personnel;
▪physical requirements of a facility;
▪equipment; and
▪validation and quality control.
New York law also mandates proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under New York state law, regardless of whether such laboratories are located in New York. If a laboratory is out of compliance with New York statutory or regulatory standards, the New York Department of Health, or NYDOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory’s New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory’s operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. NYDOH also must approve the LDT before the test is offered in New York. We have received written approval from NYDOH to offer our products in New York.
In addition to New York and California, other states, including Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. 
Federal Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests 
The laws and regulations governing the marketing of diagnostic products are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Clinical laboratory tests like AVISE® CTD, AVISE® SLE Prognostic and AVISE® MTX are regulated under CLIA, as administered by CMS, as well as by applicable state laws. In addition, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or 
FDCA, defines a medical device to include any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals. Our in vitro testing products are considered by the FDA to be subject to regulation as medical devices. Among other things, pursuant to the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing and promotion, and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets. 
Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has generally exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable regulations with respect to in vitro diagnostics that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory, which are referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. We believe that the AVISE® CTD and AVISE® MTX are LDTs, as are our near-term pipeline candidate tests. As a result, we believe many of our diagnostic services are currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement discretion and are not subject to the FDA’s oversight. However, reagents, instruments, software or components provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs may be subject to regulation. 
Legislative and administrative proposals proposing to amend the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will continue to be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our LDTs or to develop and introduce new tests as LDTs.
For example, in recent years, FDA has stated its intention to modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to LDTs. For example, on July 31, 2014, the FDA notified Congress of its intent to modify, in a risk-based manner, its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),” or the Framework Guidance, and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),” or the Reporting Guidance. The Framework Guidance stated that FDA intends to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the classification of medical devices generally in Classes I through III. The Reporting Guidance would have further enabled FDA to collect information regarding the LDTs currently being offered for clinical use through a notification process, as well as to enforce its regulations for reporting safety issues and collecting information on any known or suspected adverse events related to the use of an LDT. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize either guidance document to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to LDTs and to give Congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution, and the FDA issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to LDT regulation in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that FDA will not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, as opposed to through guidance documents and other informal issuances.
The FDA could ultimately modify its current approach to LDTs in a way that would subject LDTs to additional regulatory requirements. Moreover, legislative measures have could likewise result in a change to the approach to FDA's regulation over LDTs, including a requirement for premarket review of LDTs, among other things.
Medical Device Regulatory Framework 
Although we currently market our proprietary testing products as LDTs, which are currently subject to enforcement discretion, we could be subject to more onerous FDA compliance obligations in the future. Specifically, if the FDA begins to actively regulate LDTs, then, unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees. 
Device Classification 
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. 
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. 
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time-consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. 
The 510(k) Clearance Process 
Under the 510(k) clearance process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. 
After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. 
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. The de novo classification process is an alternate pathway to classify medical devices that are automatically classified into Class III but which are low to moderate risk. A manufacturer can submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. De novo classification may also be available after receipt of a “not substantially equivalent” letter following submission of a 510(k) to FDA. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a new submission in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the 
FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing 510(k)-cleared device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite application(s).
Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. 
More recently, in September 2019, the FDA published revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the recommended testing methods for such device types.
The PMA Approval Process 
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. 
Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA devices are also subject to the payment of user fees, and an annual establishment registration fee.
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and 
may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. 
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. New PMA applications or PMA supplements may also be required for modifications to any approved diagnostic tests, including modifications to our manufacturing processes, device labeling and device design, based on the findings of post-approval studies. 
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. 
Post-market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of ‘‘off-label’’ uses of cleared or approved products;
•requirements related to promotional activities;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Device manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, will be subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed medical device products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on a medical device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export approvals; or
•criminal prosecution.
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions 
We are subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar state law restrictions, such as California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA, and other comparable state laws. Together these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payor for certain designated health services, including clinical laboratory services, when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has a financial interest, such as an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. 
Sanctions for a Stark Law violation include the following:
▪denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
▪refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
▪significant civil penalties for each bill or claim for a service arising out of the prohibited referral, and additional penalties for each arrangement or scheme that the parties know (or should know) has the principal purpose of circumventing the Stark Law's prohibition;
▪the imposition of up to three times the amounts for each item or service wrongfully claimed; and
▪possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
These prohibitions apply regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which can result in additional civil and criminal penalties. 
Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Other states also have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply, some of which differ from those imposed by the Stark Law or California law. 
Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws 
The Federal Anti-kickback Statute makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a clinical laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any federal health care program. A violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may result in imprisonment for up to ten years and significant fines for each violation and additional administrative civil money penalties, plus up to three times the amount of the remuneration paid. Convictions under the Anti-kickback Statute result in mandatory exclusion from federal health care programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude health care providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the Federal False Claims Act, which is discussed in greater detail below. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Although the Anti-kickback Statute applies only to items and services reimbursable under any federal health care program, a number of states, including California, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that apply to all third-party payors, including commercial insurers, and in some states, to patients without insurance. The California Attorney General and courts have interpreted the California anti-kickback and fee-splitting laws in substantially the same way as HHS and the courts have interpreted the Anti-kickback Statute. Penalties of such state laws include imprisonment and significant monetary fines. 
Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between health care providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases. 
In addition to statutory exceptions to the Anti-kickback Statute, regulations provide for a number of safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. 
Failure to meet the requirements of the safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances. There are no regulatory safe harbors under California laws. 
Other Federal and State Health Care Laws 
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other health care fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal health care programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms “usual charge” and “substantially in excess” are subject to varying interpretations. 
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, a person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval and from, making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff 
will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. Several states, including California, have enacted comparable false claims laws which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. A person who offers or provides to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act and up to three times the amount improperly claimed. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The Office of Inspector General of HHS, or OIG, emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud, may also be implicated for similar practices offered to patients covered by commercial payors. 
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, among other things, also imposed annual reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them and in some cases their distributors to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care providers beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined under the statute) and their immediate family members. Any failure to comply with these reporting requirements could result in significant fines and penalties. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe that we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that the government will agree with our determination, and a determination that we have violated these laws and regulations, or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations, could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the fraud and abuse laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
International Regulations 
Many countries in which we may offer any of our testing products in the future have anti-kickback regulations prohibiting providers from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any national health care program. In situations involving physicians employed by state-funded institutions or national health care agencies, violation of the local anti-kickback law may also constitute a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and/or other applicable anti-corruption laws. 
The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual, business entity or employee of a U.S. business entity from offering or providing, directly or through a third party, including any potential distributors we may rely on in certain markets, anything of value to a foreign official with corrupt intent to influence an award or continuation of business or to gain an unfair advantage, whether or not such conduct violates local laws. In addition, it is illegal for a company that 
reports to the SEC to have false or inaccurate books or records or to fail to maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We will also be required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions. 
The standard of intent and knowledge under the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions is minimal intent and knowledge are usually inferred from the fact that bribery took place. The FCPA’s accounting provisions do not require intent. Violations of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions for corporations and other business entities are subject to a fine of up to $2 million and officers, directors, stockholders, employees, and agents are subject to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to five years. Other countries, including the United Kingdom and other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members, have similar anti-corruption regulations, such as the UK Bribery Act. 
When marketing our testing products outside of the U.S., we may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing, prohibitions on the import of tissue necessary for us to perform our testing products or restrictions on the export of tissue imposed by countries outside of the U.S. or the import of tissue into the U.S., and marketing approval. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the U.S. and may in some cases require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the U.S., coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. 
Privacy and Security Laws 
U.S. Data Privacy and Security Laws
Under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, HHS has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by certain entities including health care providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in certain health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA and HITECH laws and regulations include civil and criminal penalties. 
The HIPAA privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities as well as business associates, which are defined to include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a business associate. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The HIPAA security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HIPAA breach notification regulations impose certain reporting requirements on covered entities and their business associates in the event of a breach of PHI. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” and do not preempt state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI. 
HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities, such as us, and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator.
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health-related and other personal information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private 
litigation. The State of California, for example, recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. It also creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for PHI maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. 
GDPR and Foreign Laws 
We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we sell our testing products. The interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into full effect in May 2018. The GDPR implements stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is collected and used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, more robust rights for individuals in regard to their personal data and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. It provides that European Union, or EU, and European Economic Area, or EEA, member states may make their own further laws and regulations, which may impose further limitations, including in relation to the processing of biometric or health data, which may result in differences between member state laws, limit our ability to use and share personal data, cause our costs to increase, and/or harm our business and/or financial condition. Among other requirements, the GDPR also regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the European Union, or EU, and the United States remains uncertain. For example, in 2016, the EU and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR, or UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, whilst the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom long term without additional measures. These changes may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.
Billing and Government Reimbursement for Clinical Laboratory Services 
Medicare coverage is limited to items and services that are within the scope of a Medicare benefit category that are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. With respect to Medicare coverage, Palmetto GBA, the Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, responsible for administering Medicare’s molecular diagnostic services program, or MolDX Program, issued a local coverage determination, or LCD, that provides coverage for our AVISE® MTX test. The MAC responsible for administering Medicare claims submitted by our laboratory, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, has adopted Palmetto’s positive coverage policy, along with a related local coverage article that identifies a unique billing identifier for this test. 
Under Medicare, payment for our laboratory tests are generally made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, with payment amounts assigned to specific procedure billing codes. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report to 
CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostic laboratory tests”), private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. As required under PAMA, CMS uses the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests. 
On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements under PAMA. For tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are based upon these reported private payor rates. For clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are assigned a new or substantially revised CPT code, initial payment rates will be assigned by the gap-fill methodology, as under prior law. Initial payment rates for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests will be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2018 through 2020 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2021 through 2023. At the beginning of 2020, PAMA’s impact on Medicare reimbursement for AVISE® CTD was a reduction of 7.3% compared to levels experienced in 2019. Effective March 2020, as a result of our change in the composition of our AVISE® CTD test, PAMA's impact on Medicare reimbursement for AVISE® CTD was a reduction of 5.3% compared to levels experienced in 2019. We do not expect PAMA to impact Medicare reimbursement for AVISE® CTD in 2021 compared to levels experienced in 2020. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, signed into law on March 27, 2020 provides clinical laboratories a one-year reprieve from reporting requirements under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, as well as a one-year delay of rate cuts scheduled to take place next year. Reporting was not required between January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Instead, it is required between January 1, 2022 and March 31, 2022. Additionally, the next round of rate cuts was pushed from 2021 to 2022, with tests receiving cuts of up to 15% a year from 2022 through 2024.
PAMA also authorizes the adoption of new, temporary billing codes and unique test identifiers for FDA-cleared or approved tests, as well as advanced diagnostic laboratory tests. The AMA’s CPT Editorial Panel has approved a proposal to create a new section of billing codes to facilitate implementation of this section of PAMA. These proprietary laboratory analyses codes, or PLA codes, may be requested by a clinical laboratory or manufacturer to specifically identify their test. If approved, the codes are issued by the AMA on a quarterly basis. While our testing products are not presently identified by any PLA codes, we may seek a specific PLA code or codes to describe some of our testing products in the future. 
Billing for diagnostic testing can be complicated. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we must bill various payors, such as insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals, employer groups and patients, all of which have different billing requirements. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further complexity to the billing process. Changes in laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to bill our clients or increase our costs. CMS also establishes new procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process for billing government programs. Missing or incorrect information on test requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled tests, and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. Failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing federal healthcare programs could also lead to various penalties, including:
▪overpayments and recoupments of reimbursement received;
▪exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs;
▪asset forfeitures;
▪civil and criminal fines and penalties; and
▪the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business.
Any of these penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows. 
Healthcare Reform 
In March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the U.S. The ACA made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed by governmental and private insurers. The ACA, among other things, included provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters and fraud and abuse, which we expect will impact our industry and our operations in ways that we cannot currently predict. Additionally, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the entire ACA is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA, on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying 
health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court’s decision that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additional state and federal health care reform measures may also be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the clinical laboratory industry.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 181 full-time employees, and 2 part-time employees in the United States. These included 35 in laboratory operations, 12 in research and development, 71 in sales and marketing and 63 in general and administrative functions. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success. Our employees are a significant asset and we aim to create an equitable, inclusive and empowering environment in which our employees can grow and advance their careers, with the overall goal of developing, expanding and retaining our workforce to support our current pipeline and future business goals. By focusing on employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to support our business and operations, our pipeline, and also protect the long-term interests of our securityholders. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain a diverse group of employees. Our efforts to recruit and retain a diverse and passionate workforce include providing competitive compensation and benefits packages and ensuring we listen to our employees.
We value innovation, passion, data-driven decision making, persistence and honesty, and are building a diverse environment where our employees can thrive and be inspired to make exceptional contributions to bring novel testing products to patients.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, motivating and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and directors through grants of stock-based compensation awards and payments of cash-based performance bonus awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating our employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We are committed to providing a competitive and comprehensive benefits package to our employees. Our benefits package provides a balance of protection along with the flexibility to meet the individual health and wellness needs of our employees. We plan to continue to refine our efforts related to optimizing our use of human capital as we grow, including improvements in the way we hire, develop, motivate and retain employees.
Suppliers 
We rely on sole suppliers for the critical supply of reagents, equipment and other materials that we use to perform the tests that comprise our AVISE® testing products. We also purchase components used in our AVISE® testing product transportation kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. 
Financial Information
