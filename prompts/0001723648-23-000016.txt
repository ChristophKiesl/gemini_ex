Business Overview
LiveVox is a next generation, cloud-based contact-center-as-a-service (“CCaaS”) platform focused on deployments in both mid-market and enterprise organizations. Our mission is to help contact centers maximize their performance by seamlessly integrating omnichannel communications (voice, email, chat, SMS, etc.), artificial intelligence (“AI”), customer relationship management (“CRM”) and workforce engagement management (“WEM”), in an easy-to-implement and easy-to-optimize platform. Built on a scalable, public cloud infrastructure, LiveVox can serve as a self-contained, out-of-the-box solution, or as a foundational platform that connects to other services through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Facilitating more than 14 billion transactions annually, we have built a differentiated approach to the contact center software market, complemented by an attractive financial model.
•Large and growing CCaaS market opportunity: The contact center market is in the early stages of a shift to cloud-based solutions and we estimate that the vast majority of call center agents are not using cloud-based solutions today. Various trends are driving this transition, including digital transformation, the automation of manual contact center labor, and the need for AI-enabled analytics to support omnichannel workflows and agents. We estimate the contact center market to be approximately $27 billion for 2022, of which approximately $4 billion is comprised of cloud-based solutions. LiveVox and other industry sources estimate the total spend of this market to reach approximately $83 billion by 2030. As enterprises continue to execute on their digital transformation strategies, we believe we are well positioned to capture a meaningful amount of this growth as we increase the capillarity of our investments in sales and marketing to educate more potential customers about our platform.
•Differentiated product: We offer a cloud-based, enterprise-focused contact center solution. The LiveVox Platform consists of innovative cloud-based AI and omnichannel offerings, anchored by its native CRM solution. Our products are designed to enable customers to remove legacy technology barriers and accelerate adoption of cloud-based solutions, regardless of their digital transformation journey status. Our platform is configured with features and functionalities as well as compliance standards and capabilities, and integrations with many existing third-party solutions, providing customers with a simple and scalable implementation process. We believe that our integrated offering accelerates the adoption of cloud-based contact center solutions, eliminates data silos, and allows our users to maximize engagement with their customers and create differentiated end user experiences. We believe that we are currently the only company to offer a product that integrates Omnichannel, Contact Center, CRM, WEM and AI capabilities in a single offering.
◦Integration: Our products integrate AI and omnichannel capabilities under one platform, alongside CRM and WEM functionalities, equipping customers with a single platform to support their contact center capabilities while providing consistent platform-wide analysis and reporting.
Table of Contents

◦Approach to CRM and data: Our products unify multiple disparate systems that clients already have in place by integrating the existing systems of record, many of the CRMs already within departments, and other often-used communication platforms, in order to present a single view of all customer conversations. Additionally, the platform provides a variety of integration methods, from data exchange methods, APIs, visual integration points through our embedded framework to a Robotic Process Automation library. Moreover, the CRM platform is used for a number of out-of-the-box use-cases, such as delivering customer service and ticketing functionality, lead management workflows and follow-up cadences, and agent guides and knowledge management tools.
◦Enterprise-grade architecture: We offer enterprise-grade compliance, security, and governance capabilities that benefit our customers, many of whom are in highly regulated industries. While our platform is scalable for businesses of all sizes, currently it primarily serves enterprise companies with complex contact center needs, interactions in the millions, and use cases focused on the needs of a modern contact center. 
•Attractive financial profile, underpinned by the following qualities:
◦Recurring revenue model: We typically sell our products to customers under one- to three-year subscription contracts that stipulate a minimum amount of monthly usage and associated revenue with the ability for the customer to consume more usage above the minimum contract amount each month. Our subscription revenue is comprised of the minimum usage revenue under contract (which we call “contract revenue”) and amounts billed for usage above the minimum contract value (which we call “excess usage revenue”), both of which are recognized on a monthly basis following deployment to the customer. Excess usage revenue is deemed to be specific to the month in which the usage occurs, since the minimum usage commitments reset at the beginning of each month. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our total revenue was $136.0 million, 98% of which was subscription revenue (including contract revenue and excess usage revenue), with the remainder consisting of professional services and other non-recurring revenue derived from the implementation of our products.
◦Attractive unit economics: We benefit from strong sales efficiency, driven by the productivity of our salesforce and flexible commercial model. This model seeks to meet customers at any stage of their digital transformation by utilizing a “land and expand” strategy that allows us to provide a subset of our full contact center solution to meet a customer’s initial requirements, and then expand that relationship by providing more features and functionality that empowers the customer to continue on their journey to greater digital and AI adoption. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net revenue retention rate for the last twelve month period (“LTM”) was 113%, and our average net revenue retention rate was 110% over the period 2019 to 2022. We estimate that the average calculated lifetime value of our customers is approximately 5 times the associated cost of acquiring them for the time period from 2019 to 2022.
We intend to build on this foundation and have strategically increased our sales and marketing investment to capture future opportunities, including by increasing the aperture of our go-to-market organization, increasing the efficiency and productivity of our salesforce, and expanding our geographic reach and partnerships.
Shift to Cloud-Based CCaaS Solutions
We believe that the vast majority of today’s businesses are still using on-premise solutions and that the market for cloud-based contact center software is growing rapidly, driven by a number of factors including the following:
•Digital transformation: Many companies continue to modernize all aspects of their businesses, incorporating digital, mobile, and cloud technologies in all areas. This is especially true for contact centers, where cloud-based solutions increase agility, flexibility, and efficiency. As more retail transactions occur online and not in a physical storefront, the contact center plays a bigger role in a consumer's learning and buying process. Consumers’ preferences are moving away from voice to digital, and our platform enables companies to provide a digital-first service option.
•Automation of manual labor: Human labor has traditionally been a necessity and the largest area of spend for the contact center. However, modern AI and cloud technologies support offerings that streamline manual processes. As these solutions reach cost and performance parity with manual labor, we expect their penetration to further increase.
•Increased focus on customer experience: In the past, contact centers were viewed primarily as cost centers. Today, they are viewed as an important part of the customer experience, and, ultimately, the enterprise brand. As a result, the contact center is viewed as a key point of contact in facilitating a high-value customer experience. Contact centers are increasingly focused on user engagement, resulting in greater focus on AI-enabled analytics and CRM. Organizations are subsequently evaluating their technology strategies and the role of the contact center agent, and increasingly shifting to cloud-based solutions.
•Increased demand for work-from-home flexibility: Historically, organizations viewed on-premise infrastructure as better suited for deployments with significant security, compliance, and governance requirements. Those beliefs have evolved more towards acceptance of cloud-based solutions in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this evolution, as it caused a rapid increase in remote work and distributed workforces.

LiveVox’s Market Opportunity
Our CCaaS market opportunity consists of the total spend on contact center software solutions. We estimate this market to have been approximately $27 billion in 2022, of which approximately $4 billion was comprised of cloud-based solutions and we estimate the market to reach approximately $83 billion by 2030. While the contact center market is our initial focus, we are seeing a major convergence take place as the CCaaS market converges with the CRM market, as well as digital-first service platforms. This convergence, along with our product set, positions us well to capture the newly converged marketplace and deliver our clients a solution that is easy to deploy and manage. 
We believe that the majority of our addressable market is unpenetrated today. Over time, we expect our total addressable market to grow considerably, due to a combination of cloud-based market tailwinds, our shift into new products to expand our addressable market, and contact center labor automation.

Growth Strategies
We are driving growth in our business by executing across a number of strategies including:

Table of Contents

•Acquire new customers: In 2022, we streamlined our go-to-market team by 18%, to more efficiently address our current channels and provide resources to invest in new opportunities, such as expanded partnerships and geographies.
•Increase revenue from existing customers: We benefit from a land and expand model in which our revenue from existing customers grows over time. This is driven by our focus on large enterprise customers, as well as our sales strategy in which we often “land” in a single department or line of business, providing us a strong upsell potential over time to expand the amount of business we do with a customer. For the last four years ending December 31, 2022, our LTM net revenue retention rate was 110%, on average. We believe a considerable opportunity exists for additional revenue from our existing customers through the sale of additional seats and products. We have identified opportunities we believe will allow us to expand our revenue from existing customers based on seats that are not currently using our software. We will continue to invest resources into identifying and executing on opportunities for increased penetration with existing customers.
•Accelerate product innovation: We believe our platform is ideally suited for expansion and has a demonstrated track record of expanding the functionality and use cases of our products. Since 2014, we have expanded the functionality of our platform from an outbound-focused collections provider to an integrated omnichannel/AI platform that addresses all aspects of the agent experience. We will continue to invest in new technologies and harness existing ones.
•Grow the LiveVox Platform offering through partnerships and opportunistic M&A: We plan to continue to solidify our position as a competitive enterprise cloud-based contact center software company. In addition to ongoing organic investment and partnerships, we may continue to explore opportunistic M&A as a source of product expansion, geographic reach, and growth.

CRM

•Contact Manager and Extract, Transform, and Load (“ETL”) Tools – At the core of the LiveVox Platform is a database layer that functions as a repository and orchestration layer for customers and their customer records. These records function as an index, allowing each communication to be appropriately matched to each customer. This database fills the need for customer service, sales, business process outsourcing (“BPO”) and any other of our customers to ensure no single interaction is orphaned. The combination of historical data, consumer attributes and consent are utilized by multiple applications to enhance consumers’ experiences in any channel, ensure that agents are provided relevant information and confirm analytical models are appropriately set up with the right data. Moreover, the application provides a visual layer, designed to understand customer population, create “what if” scenarios and execute both simple and complex segmentation strategies for personalized campaign launches in an Omnichannel environment. Additionally, we have invested in a robust set of ETL tools designed to integrate with customers’ existing modern CRM platforms, systems of records and legacy systems, ensuring consistent management of data and high reliability of future AI deployments.
•U-CRM – Provides a visual layer, surfacing relevant information to agents during every interaction. This offering provides relevant customer details, helping to expedite calls through a shorter authentication and verification process. Access to prior interactions across voice, email, SMS, chat and other channels helps agents understand use history and gives better context to the conversation. All communication channels are exposed to agents allowing them to send notifications via SMS or follow-up with an email in real time if the conversation requires it. Moreover, supporting attachments, key notes and account details are available through a single interface. A universal inbox ensures all non-voice interactions are routed to agents to easily access and respond to customer inquiries.
•U-Ticket – Creates support tickets and tracks all the relevant details to solve issues. This offering ensures that all communication (including phone calls, emails, chat conversations and SMS messages) is tracked, and relevant details provided to customer teams, helping them solve problems quickly and empowering the team with cross-organizational visibility. It automates processes to route tickets to appropriate teams for quicker resolution, close out customer requests for increased satisfaction, and escalate urgent issues to appropriate teams and managers. It also provides access to channels, by offering digital forms that allow for simple ticket classification and identification by customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
•U-Script – A visual agent flow tool designed to provide guidance and visual navigation to agents. U-Script is commonly utilized to improve training for new employees. The tool can be configured and modified by administrators and provided to

Omnichannel and AI

•Voice
◦Inbound – Provides customers with enterprise-grade voice services and features. Utilizing our unified data model, callers are automatically identified through a combination of automatic number identification match technology, third-party data lookups and/or customer self-authentication methods. Call history is dynamically retrieved, identifying prior agent conversations, agent ownership and/or unique customer attributes, helping to route calls via our automated call distributor. Callers are matched with agents based on a combination of availability, skills and proficiencies, ensuring the appropriate match of customer to agent. Administrators gain real-time visibility across their entire organization through a combination of dashboards, providing top-level metrics with drill-down capabilities and real-time coaching tools such as whisper, barge or take-over.
◦Outbound – Provides what we believe to be best-in-class outbound voice applications that combine the scalability of our platform with compliance standards required by companies in highly regulated industries. Our outbound voice capabilities function independently as a stand-alone service, as well as blended into inbound voice operations, allowing customers to maximize agent efficiency and adhere to inbound and outbound voice service level agreements (“SLA”). We believe that our architecture ensures that each outbound dialing system contains software and hardware separation necessary to comply with the highest of regulatory standards. Our outbound applications include the following functions:
▪Predictive dialing – a high-velocity dialing tool commonly utilized by sales organizations, enterprise customers and others obtaining strong forms of consent necessary to reach many customers in a short time with live agents. The system utilizes predictive algorithms, which adjust in real time to pair groups of agents with number of calls and consumer answer patterns.
▪Unattended dialing – a high-velocity voice messaging tool designed to deliver critical time-sensitive messages to consumers. Utilized particularly for the education, health care and financial services verticals to remind consumers of appointments and other vital business matters.
▪Outbound Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”) – a messaging application allowing consumers to opt into conversations with agents based on confirmation of good/services or to serve as an immediate escalation point. Commonly utilized in the financial services and health-care verticals for reminders and ability to speak with a contact center individual.
▪Manual dialing – a strictly manual environment allowing agents to manually initiate a call to consumer via a single click on a phone number and/or a manual entry of phone numbers into the agent phone panel. The manual systems do not contain any capability or capacity to make any other forms of calls and are commonly utilized by an organization unsure of current consent and/or a potential revocation of consent by the consumer.
▪Human Call Initiator - a proprietary outbound dialing system that allows agents to launch calls manually via a single click (i.e., single click/single call). The user interface is optimized to deliver a single phone number to an agent to initiate a call while ensuring that no call is dialed automatically.
•IVR and contact flow – We provide customers the tools to create cross-channel, self-service journeys that are customized for their customers. We offer a wide array of features allowing our customers to customize their IVRs, including drag-and-drop features, over 40 pre-built modules, Text to Speech capabilities, a library of professionally recorded voice prompts, and omnichannel capabilities. Additionally, our API modules within Contact Flow Editor permit customers to use representational state transfer APIs to integrate with existing systems. Our IVR supports a “bring-your-own bot environment” while also providing a number of connectors to leading bot and virtual agent providers.
•Dashboard, Reporting, Wall-Boards – We provide a series of dashboard and reporting interfaces across the entire product suite, with the ability to drill down to each individual interaction. A series of dashboards provide valuable insights by displaying real-time contact center metrics across voice, email, SMS, and chat, including agent performance, tickets created and quality of interactions. The bi-directional nature of the dashboards provides true visibility into the contact center. Agent performance views provide the ability to understand agent status and monitor an agent’s current conversation. The reporting suite offers a number of industry standard and best practice reports along with the capability to filter across multiple dimensions and combine interaction, agent and consumer data elements, providing true insight for enterprise organizations. Wallboards are specifically designed for large scale display options within a contact center, providing insight with a highly configurable interface and real-time alert capabilities.

•SMS Messaging – We provide a comprehensive SMS suite for customers ensuring that multiple use cases across many verticals are met. These offerings ensure that messages are delivered at a high throughput across short-code, long-code, toll-free number and 10-digit long code formats. The platform provides an attachment library and facilitates messages via rich communications systems protocols. Our aggregator-agnostic architecture supports the ability to independently route volume to observe high SLA standards for message delivery. Strategies and hold-out timeframes along with key word response management ensure customer service is always top of mind. The LiveVox Platform provides customers the ability to consistently observe guidelines published by the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association and offers customer tools for visibility of opt-ins and opt-outs across the consumer base. A universal inbox is provided to ensure SMS responses are appropriately routed, distributed and managed by agents.
•Email – Our email offerings provide campaign and email response capabilities, ensuring all email interactions are stored at the customer level. The campaign-based function provides an HTML build tool, helping customers easily configure templates, insert variables and ensure content meets brand standards. A universal inbox provides agents access to email responses, eliminating race conditions and ensuring every interaction is joined with a customer profile. We provide the ability to comply with the requirements of the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act of 2003, and every receipt or removal of consent can be managed within the platform.
•WebChat – WebChat offers our customers the capability of providing service through a web-based or mobile channel, allowing customers to begin conversations instantly through any site. The WebChat product ensures text, images, documents and even screen-shares can be easily shared between consumers and agents to deliver quick problem resolution.
•Virtual Agents & Bots – We provide an environment that offers customers the ability to automate and enhance conversations with consumers. The platform offers three variants of assisted conversations:
◦Managed Virtual Agent – a custom-created virtual agent capability combining Natural Language Processing, Automated Speech (Text) Recognition and Learning Intents & Suggestions paired with human oversight. This offering provides customers a fully managed service of tuning and maintaining Virtual Agents & Bots.
◦Self-Service Virtual Agent – a self-directed model to create a virtual agent and/or bot utilizing a visual layer to prescribe intents, analyze patterns and create new automated flows for the virtual agent and/or bot. This is designed for simpler use cases, quicker deployments and smaller enterprise organizations needing to make small changes quickly.
◦Bring Your Own – provides the ability for our customers to integrate their own virtual agent provider into the LiveVox framework utilizing a low-code environment provided through the LiveVox Platform.
All of the above paths for customers offer three advantages: expedited deployments, enhanced customer experience and ability to deploy against any communication channel. Expedited deployments allow customers in a low-code setting to integrate or connect their virtual agent into the contact center setting and enrich each conversation through utilization of LiveVox CRM data directly within the virtual agent, which ensures the virtual agent has the proper context for many interactions. Enhanced customer experience is driven through virtual agent awareness of customers and their data through the LiveVox CRM. In addition, this CRM ensures seamless hand-offs between virtual agents and human agents within the contact center, should the need to escalate arise. Any of the virtual agent deployments may be set against a single or multiple channels in which customers operate, decreasing the need to build separate logic for each channel and ensuring consistency in virtual agent communication.
•Campaign management – We offer a sophisticated tool for managing segmentation and creating campaigns for customers. The visual editor allows for the creation of a variety of scenarios based on consumer attributes, prior interaction outcomes and compliance-based restrictions. Furthermore, strategies are utilized to optimize calling windows and message delivery based on inputs provided by the customer.
WEM

•Call and screen recording – Provides administrators the capability to record voice conversations as well as agent screens to help facilitate quality management activities, and to help with compliance and audits for customers in highly regulated verticals. A reporting graphical user interface (“GUI”) provides the ability to look up conversations and filter for auditing purposes.
•Business Intelligence – Provides administrators and operators business insight by combining CRM data with operational insight across channels through a combination of more than 150 reports and dashboards. The LiveVox analyzer tool gives analysts insight to map new variables and create key metrics and dashboards to discover valuable insights. A number of machine learning models can also be applied to this tool to optimize enterprise performance.
•Quality management – Provides feedback loops between contact center operators and agents by routing contact center interactions to quality management teams for evaluation and analysis. Quality teams can assign values and create scorecards to evaluate every interaction and provide instant agent feedback to ensure agent performance is optimized, documented, and ultimately improved on. An intuitive interface ensures a connection between quality teams and the agent desktop providing a single system to manage quality management. A learning library supports these efforts, giving operators the ability to assign learning material to further enhance agent conversations.

Professional Services
We offer comprehensive professional services to our customers to assist in the successful implementation and optimization of the LiveVox products. Our professional services include application configuration, system integration, business process optimization, technical support and training. Our customers may use our professional services team for initial implementation of our products or when expanding their use of our application suite.
Being cloud-native reduces implementation time and complexity by removing the need for on-premise hardware or dedicated infrastructure. We believe that we can deploy and optimize our products in significantly less time than required for deployments of legacy on-premise contact center systems. Because of this, our professional services engagements typically focus on optimization and process improvement, rather than installation or logistics. A full contact center suite of products can be implemented by us in as little as three weeks as compared to what we believe to be as much as six months for our competitors.
Our SmartStart Master Portal provides new customers the ability to be up and running in days through better integration and customer training tools, which are available to them on day one of implementation.
Customers
We had approximately 340 customers as of December 31, 2022, including enterprises, Fortune 1,000 financial institutions, and BPO firms. As of December 31, 2022, no single customer represented more than 10% of our revenues. Our enterprise customers span a variety of industries, including financial services (including leading banks and fin-techs), healthcare, consumer/retail, and telecommunications. 
Sales and Marketing
Our go-to-market strategy is led by our direct sales force which is primarily focused on enterprise and mid-market organizations. The sales team is comprised of the “Acquisition Team”, which is responsible for new logo generation; the “Named Accounts Team”, which is responsible for account preservation and upsell; and Channel account managers, who focus on facilitating sales leads from our growing channel partner ecosystem. We have developed a targeted and disciplined, outcomes-based land and expand sales strategy designed to enable our sales force to efficiently generate and close net new logo opportunities. Additionally, we have a strategic cadence around upsell and cross-sell opportunities that centers on regularly scheduled customer business reviews. These business reviews lead to additional products being showcased/positioned to our existing customer base.
Supporting the Acquisition team is our outbound lead generation team, consisting of Business Development Reps (“BDRs”) and Sales Development Reps (“SDRs”). The BDRs work in concert with the Acquisition Team through a specific named account strategy to drive high-quality leads through the sales funnel. The SDRs cultivate and nurture marketing qualified leads, while also fielding inbound prospect traffic, to help drive additional highly qualified leads.
Our marketing team uses a data-driven approach for lead generation and nurturing activities. Through a sophisticated marcom/technology stack, the team focuses on prospects that are the strongest fit and that have the highest propensity to buy. Using intent analytics, we craft streams of content and advertising specifically geared to each prospect and their product interests to establish 
Table of Contents

relevant awareness and interaction, and ultimately purchase consideration. To accomplish this, the team employs a multi-faceted approach, including content curation, a full array of digital marketing, trade shows, webinars, industry analyst programs, public relations, and more.
We intend to continue investing in our Go To Market team, while building out our marketing capabilities and continuing to improve sales force productivity.
In the third quarter of 2021, LiveVox introduced an indirect marketing team and strategy to support the Channel Sales Team of Channel Account Managers (“CAMs”) formed in July 2021.
 The Channel’s go-to-market strategy is supported as follows: 
•Partner Recruitment is supported through strategic marketing agreements with six top national Master Agent/TSB entities that drive access to top contact center reselling agents in our focused regions. Additionally, Channel Marketing supports the execution of numerous partner-facing events in the channel including regional events, roadshows, and industry tradeshows. 
•Partner Enablement & Readiness is supported through programs that focus on educating our partners about LiveVox’s products, differentiators, and value proposition. This is accomplished through participation in partner trainings, regional CCaaS academies, and boot camps. 
•End User Demand Generation is supported with the creation of through-partner campaigns and assets that empower our strategic partners to promote LiveVox to their existing and prospective customer bases. 
Research and Development
Our research and development drives continuous innovation cycles for our contact center platform. Our functional, industry, and technology experts collaborate with customers and partners to analyze data trends, apply industry best practices, and innovate on new products that result in new features and functions regularly being added to the platform – a process we refer to as Data Driven Innovation (“DDI”). With our breadth of deeply integrated contact center products and 340 customers, we have a wealth of data to drive new features for agent and customer experiences, including data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These features are bundled and released two times a year.
Our core research and development operations are based in San Francisco, California; Medellin, Colombia; and Bangalore, India. This geographic footprint allows for recruitment from broad and diverse talent pools. 
Technology and Operations
Our highly scalable SaaS platform was developed with the end user in mind. Our platform uses market-oriented research, as well as development and operational experience. Our platform is comprised of in-house developed intellectual property, and open source and commercially available components. Our platform is designed to be redundant and scalable, to leverage cloud-native capabilities in support of business continuity and disaster recovery (“BCDR”) functionality, and to support multi-tenancy from the ground up. In addition, the architecture is designed to support capacity increases on demand, facilitate continuous integration and continuous development (“CI/CD”), and permit life cycle management with minimal or no impact to customers’ use of our products.
We currently deliver our products globally from six public cloud third-party facilities located in Virginia, Ohio, Oregon, Canada, Germany, and Ireland. Our infrastructure is designed to support real-time mission-critical telecommunications, applications, and operational support systems as well as multiple customer connectivity methods over carrier services as well as direct connect. Our infrastructure is built with redundant, fault-tolerant components in distinct and secure availability zones forming protective layers for our applications and customer data.
We have implemented and maintained an operations team that focuses on four primary pillars: capacity management, performance, security, and availability. The 24x7x365 operations teams work to ensure continuous health and reliability by monitoring our data centers, applications, and carrier services for potential issues, as well as manage capacity, evaluate potential security incidents, and maintain the overall health and integrity of our platform environments.
Competition
We believe that the cloud-based customer engagement and communications industry is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from established providers as well as emerging startups focusing on niche services and channels. Our key competitors include:
•traditional on-premise hardware business communications providers such as Avaya Inc., Alvaria, Cisco Systems, Inc., Mitel Networks Corporation, and partners that resell or license their software;
Table of Contents

•cloud-based contact center software providers such as Five9, NICE InContact, Genesys, Lifesize, 8x8, RingCentral and Talkdesk;
•digital engagement providers such as eGain Corporation, Lithium Technologies and LivePerson; and
•developer-focused software providers such as Amazon, and Twilio.
Most of our direct competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more diversified customer bases and larger marketing and development budgets. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers and may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure. Additionally, with cloud-deployment solutions gaining more adherents and technology advancing rapidly, we expect intensified competition in the future.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include, but are not limited to:
•platform reliability and scalability;
•breadth and depth of platform features;
•compliance and security capabilities;
•ease of administration, integration, and use;
•ease and speed of deployment;
•domain expertise in contact center operations;
•strength of third-party partnership ecosystem;
•artificial intelligence capabilities; and
•scale and expertise offered to the growing market for customer engagement and contact center services.
Intellectual Property
We protect our proprietary information through a combination of contractual agreements (containing confidentiality provisions and licensing restrictions) and trade secret laws. We protect our brand through contractual provisions that require our consent before use of our brand, as well as through trademark registrations. Additionally, all LiveVox employees sign agreements containing confidentiality and intellectual property assignment provisions, whereby any intellectual property they might develop as LiveVox employees is assigned to LiveVox.
As of December 31, 2022, our intellectual property portfolio included six registered U.S. trademarks and one issued U.S. patent.
We use third-party technology to support our software platform under various license agreements with those third parties. These license agreements contain standard and customary licensing rights to use the technology. Third-party infringement claims pertaining to this third-party technology could have a disruptive effect on our operations.
Seasonality
We believe that there can be structural factors that may cause our revenues in the first half of a year to be lower than our revenues in the second half of the year. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 52% of our total revenues were generated in the second half of the year. We believe this is due to steadily increasing recurring revenue on our platform that typically drives higher revenue in the second half of each year.
Human Capital Resources
Our workforce is an integral part of our success, with a team of professionals including those focused on technology and operations, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative functions. As of December 31, 2022, our workforce consisted of 627 full-time employees, comprised of 211 in Technology and Operations, 179 in Research and Development, 176 in Sales and Marketing and 61 in General and Administrative.
We consider our LiveVox people community and the way we work to support each other and serve our customers to be the foundation of our success. The key human capital measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business are: maintaining a strong team-first company culture, increasing our diversity, inclusion and belonging, offering fair and competitive compensation and benefits, investing in people and organizational development, protecting and enriching employee health and wellness, and sustaining a culture of respectful and effective communications.
Team-First Company Culture
We built a high-performance culture on our foundational aspirations expressed in the “LiveVox Way”: a combination of our values, operational priorities and strategic intent. These are:
•Develop great people;
Table of Contents

•Marry innovation and discipline;
•Data-driven innovation cycle;
•Build sustainable competitive advantage; and
•Differentiated cloud-first company
The LiveVox Way guides what we invest in, how we work, what we measure and improve to serve all our stakeholders: customers, teammates, stockholders, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate. 
Maintaining a culture where innovation thrives is a requirement for all SaaS companies. LiveVox pairs strong business planning discipline with agile development cycles to rapidly deliver innovative solutions our customers want. We align work plans vertically and horizontally throughout the organization using an Objectives and Key Results (“OKRs”) framework. Our company-wide objectives and key measures of success apply and are visible to teams around the world. This strong operational alignment provides great visibility to manage our business and increases our competitive advantage. We quickly identify opportunities to exploit, and obstacles to remove, and we coordinate across teams to effectively manage change and drive higher performance. 
LiveVox regularly recognizes teams and individuals for supporting each other and our customers, achieving promotions and other career milestones and even making it through a challenge. In addition to regular team and cross-functional operations calls, we conduct monthly global All Hands calls to keep everyone current, answer questions, and celebrate our teammates – shining the spotlight on our most valuable assets: our people.
We collect feedback from our people to better understand and improve the LiveVox career experience and to identify opportunities to strengthen our culture and our business results. We regularly pulse our new hires, managers, and teammates to understand their interview and onboarding experiences, how our learning and development programs are working, and what more we can do to support them.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at LiveVox
Being a global organization, diversity, inclusion, and belonging are part of the fabric of our culture. We also want to increase diversity at LiveVox, so we have implemented a strategy to do so.
First, we are boosting our cultural competence in seeking out new perspectives and ideas and incorporating them into our business. We do this by learning about and experiencing different cultural traditions and approaches to work. LiveVox hosts monthly events in alignment with our diversity calendar, sponsors Employee Affinity Groups with diverse interests, and has a growing “hands on” community outreach program in every country where we have employees. Activities connect employees to diverse and often under-served groups, fostering a greater sense of cultural appreciation, sensitivity, and a more personally enriching environment for everyone. 
 We actively teach how to seek out and incorporate new perspectives and ideas. Our People Operations Department delivers new hire and ongoing training in effectively giving and asking for feedback, how to be aware of and prevent unconscious bias, and data-driven performance management. These programs improve communication and foster an inclusive company culture which, in turn, helps us to attract and retain diverse talent.
We have clear anti-discrimination/harassment policies, and we enforce them. Our policies are clearly communicated in our Employee Handbook and Governance Policies – but we go further. During new hire on-boarding we clarify expected and unacceptable conduct. We conduct mandatory management training on anti-discrimination/harassment, and we train managers on how unconscious bias impacts business decisions and how to prevent it. Incidents are rare at LiveVox, but when they occur, our processes and practices ensure everyone in the process knows we take these situations very seriously. The tone starts at the top. Our leadership team walks the walk so everyone understands both what is expected of them, and the support they can count on if there are issues. 
We are passionate about, and invest in, a fair and level playing field. Equal pay, equal equity and equal career opportunities are foundational to attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. Our people team maintains global job, salary and equity structures and decision-supporting tools and train managers on how to use them. Every compensation decision—at job offer, merit review, transfer and promotion—is made in the context of a job-level and internal comparator review. We conduct thorough, annual compensation cohort analyses to address outliers that may emerge. 
The success of any project depends on measuring progress. The last element of our strategy is to monitor the success of our diversity and inclusion initiatives. Employee surveys are a great way to do this. We also compare our metrics to external benchmarks for an objective view of our progress. 
Government Regulation
The following summarizes important, but not all, regulations that could impact our operations. Regulations are subject to judicial proceedings and to legislative and administrative proposals that could materially affect how LiveVox and others in our industry operate. The specific impact, however, cannot be predicted at this time.
Table of Contents

The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has jurisdiction over interstate and international telecommunications services and Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) telephony in the U.S. The FCC has not classified all Internet Protocol (“IP”)-enabled or VoIP communications services as unregulated information services or as regulated telecommunications services. Based on the nature of our IP-enabled services, we believe that many of those services are information services. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that the regulatory classification of IP-enabled services remains uncertain, and changes to the regulatory treatment of IP-based communications services could significantly affect our business.
LiveVox is registered with the FCC and began providing interconnected VoIP services in the second half of 2021. The FCC has imposed various regulatory requirements on interconnected VoIP providers that previously applied only to traditional telecommunications providers, such as obligations to provide 911 functionality, to contribute to the federal Universal Service and Telecommunications Relay Services Funds, to comply with regulations relating to local number portability, to abide by the FCC’s service discontinuance rules and to abide by the regulations concerning Customer Proprietary Network Information, outage reporting, access for persons with disabilities, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act and expanded obligations with respect to the transmission of emergency calls. In some instances, these regulations indirectly affect LiveVox because they directly apply to its customers or its suppliers. We cannot predict whether the FCC will impose additional requirements, regulations or charges upon interconnected VoIP services or other services that may include some voice functionality. Our IP-enabled services (including, where applicable, interconnected VoIP services), or customers who use such services, are or may be subject to some or all of the following regulations:
•The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), which regulates the use of automatic telephone dialing systems and artificial or prerecorded voice technologies to place calls and texts to wireless and residential landline telephone numbers. The FCC, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general have the authority to enforce compliance with the TCPA. Moreover, the TCPA also allows aggrieved private parties to directly seek civil remedies and seek statutory-defined damages, which may be significant, for calls or text messages received without recipients’ proper consent. The scope and interpretation of these laws and regulations is inconsistent and continues to evolve and develop.
•The TRACED Act, which is designed to limit “robocalls” to consumers through a variety of mechanisms, such as call authentication requirements. The TRACED Act directs the FCC to conduct a number of different rulemaking proceedings and increases the FCC’s enforcement authority. The FCC adopted new rules and is conducting several proceedings to understand and address fraud and abuse in the form of illegal robocalling, and we are continuing to assess the impact of such proceedings and subsequent regulations on our business. Currently, recently adopted rules allow carriers to block certain calls that they determine to be unlawful or unwanted. The TRACED Act also revised the FCC’s ability to enforce the TCPA, and we cannot predict the impact of the recent rules adopted by the FCC or what the impact of new rules may be on our business at this time.
•The Telemarketing Sales Rule, which governs the manner of telemarketing outreach.
•FCC Universal Service regulations, which implement universal service support for access to communications services in rural and high-cost areas and to low-income consumers at reasonable rates; and access to advanced communications services by schools, libraries and rural health care providers. Any change in the FCC assessment methodology, or in our assessment of the applicability of the FCC assessment methodology to our business, may affect our revenue and expenses, but at this time, it is not possible to predict the extent LiveVox would be affected, if at all.
•Federal Trade Commission enforcement authority and regulations, which generally relate to advertising, privacy practices, and avoiding unfair and deceptive trade practices.
•The Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (“FDCPA”), which governs the manner of third-party debt collections. Regulation F, which implements the FDCPA and which took effect on November 30, 2021, governs third-party debt collectors and, among other things, limits the number of call attempts that a debt collector may make to a consumer to seven calls per account within a seven-day period. Once the debt collector makes actual contact with a consumer, the debt collector may not call the consumer again about that same account for a seven-day period.
•Various regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).
•Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) regulations
•Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) regulations
•Various State Regulations LiveVox may also be subject to state laws and regulations affecting certain communications services or other parts of its business, including for example state requirements that are similar to the types of federal requirements discussed above.
•Various International Regulations To the extent that we provide products or services internationally, we are subject to additional foreign regulations that may be ambiguous or more restrictive than domestic law and regulations, such as the GDPR.
The application and interpretation of the federal, state, and international laws and regulations to which LiveVox, its products and its customers are subject are often uncertain, particularly given the new and rapidly evolving industry in which LiveVox operates. Because these federal, state, and international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that LiveVox or its customers may not be, or may not have been, compliant with all applicable laws or regulations. If LiveVox or its 
Table of Contents

customers do not comply with current or future rules or regulations that apply to their respective businesses, LiveVox and its customers may face reputational harm, fines, penalties, investigations, forfeitures, costs, and operational restrictions and LiveVox may have to restructure its products, create new products, and otherwise adapt to the changing legal and regulatory landscape, all of which could adversely affect our business operations. Refer to Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for more information.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an emerging growth company (“EGC”), as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not EGCs including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an EGC until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) 2024, which is the fifth anniversary of the closing of Crescent’s initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to EGC shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
