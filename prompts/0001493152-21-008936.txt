ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
We are a Nevada corporation originally incorporated on March 20, 2007, under the name SWAV Enterprises, Ltd. On September 6, 2010, we changed our name to GBS Enterprises Incorporated and from 2010 to September 2018 we were in the software products and advisory services business for email and instant messaging applications. We divested that business between December 2016 and September 2018 and, since that time, we have begun to focus on the acquisition of life science technologies.
 
We changed our name to Marizyme, Inc. on March 21, 2018, to reflect our new life sciences focus. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets’ QB tier under the symbol “MRZM.” We may also examine our options with respect to the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock market or the NYSE.
 
In the second half of 2018, we acquired the protease-based therapeutic platform called Krillase® from ACB Holding AB.
 
Recent Events
 
Somahlution Asset Acquisition
 
On July 31, 2020, we acquired all the assets and certain of the liabilities of Somahlution LLC, or Somahlution, and its related companies, referred to collectively as Somah. Somah was engaged in developing products to prevent ischemic injury to organs and tissues and its products, which we refer to as the “Somah Products,” include DuraGraft®, a one-time intraoperative vascular graft treatment for use in vascular and bypass surgeries that maintains endothelial function and structure, and other related properties. As part of this acquisition, we acquired Somahlution, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Somahlution and holder of the CE marks for manufacture and sale of the DuraGraft® products in the European Union.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition, Somah was entitled to appoint two members to our board of directors, one of whom must be independent. In January 2021, Dr. Vithal Dhaduk was appointed to one of the board seats. Additionally, Dr. Satish Chandran, Somah’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, became our Chief Technical Officer and Dr. Catherine Pachuk, Somah’s Chief Science Officer, became our Chief Science Officer. Dr. Chandran left the Company on April 2, 2021.

Our Products
 
DuraGraft®
 
On July 31, 2020, Marizyme closed the acquisition of Somahlution’s product, DuraGraft.
 
The DuraGraft Product
 
Somahlution has been engaged in developing products based on its cytoprotective platform technology, to prevent ischemic injury to organs and tissues in grafting and transplantation surgeries. Its products and product candidates, which are referred to as the Somah Products, include DuraGraft, a one-time intraoperative vascular graft treatment for use in vascular and bypass surgeries that maintains endothelial function and structure, thereby reducing the incidence and complications of graft failure and improving clinical outcomes post bypass surgery.


DuraGraft Indications
 
DuraGraft is an “endothelial damage inhibitor” indicated for cardiac bypass, peripheral bypass, and other vascular surgeries. It is CE marked and is approved for marketing in 33 countries worldwide on 4 continents including, but not limited to the European Union, Turkey, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Somahlution has also been focused on developing products to mitigate the effects of ischemia reperfusion injury in other grafting and transplantation surgeries and other indications in which ischemic injury can cause disease. Multiple products derived from the cytoprotective platform technology for several indications are under various stages of development.
 

● | DuraGraft is a CE-marked endothelial damage inhibitor that protects free vascular grafts and endothelium against ischemic injury. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | DuraGraft is approved in Europe for graft protection and preservation during bypass (cardiac and peripheral) and other vascular surgeries. 
● | DuraGraft protects graft tissue from harvesting through anastomosis and is used during coronary artery bypass grafting, or CABG, (and other vascular surgeries) as a treatment to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the endothelium of isolated vascular grafts. 
● | The use of DuraGraft is associated with the reduction of post-CABG complications associated with graft disease and failure; myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE. 

Unmet Clinical Needs
 

● | CABG remains the standard treatment for multi-vessel coronary artery disease or left main artery disease. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Benefits of CABG are, however, limited by high patient level of vein graft failure (VGF) rates (50%) that have not changed in decades. 
● | “The Early Promise of Coronary Bypass Grafting has not been fulfilled and an insidiously deadly variety of atherosclerosis progressively chokes vein grafts and extinguishes their benefits,” Fitzgibbons, 1996. 
● | “VGF remains one of the leading causes of poor in-hospital and long-term outcomes after CABG,” Harskamp, 2013. 
● | “The Issue of Low Patency Rates Owing to VGF Needs Urgent Attention,” de Vries, 2016. 
● | Vein graft failure is result of damage to graft endothelium that occurs during CABG surgery. 
● | Ischemic reperfusion injury is the primary cause of endothelial damage. 
● | Vein graft failure post-CABG is associated with poor clinical outcomes. 
● | DuraGraft minimizes endothelial damage, reduces graft disease, and improves clinical outcomes.

Commercial Considerations
 
According to market analysis reports, the size value of the coronary artery bypass graft market globally was approximately $16 billion. This market is forecasted to increase at a CAGR of 5.8% from 2017 to 2025 (Grand View Research, March 2017). Globally, it is estimated that approximately 800,000 CABG procedures are performed each year (Grand View Research, March 2017), with procedures performed in the U.S. being a substantial percentage of the total global procedures performed. In the U.S., it is estimated that approximately 340,000 CABG surgeries are performed each year. The number of CABG procedures performed is predicted to decline at a rate of approximately 0.8% per year to less than 330,000 annually by 2026, primarily due to medical and technological advances in the use of percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as “angioplasty” (idata Research, September 2018).
 
In 2017, the number of peripheral vascular surgeries, which include angioplasty and bypass of peripheral arteries, vein removal, thrombectomy, and endarterectomy operations, were approximately 3.7 million worldwide. The number of peripheral vascular procedures is forecasted to increase at a CAGR of 3.9% in years 2017 to 2022 and is expected to exceed 4.5 million procedures by 2022 (Research and Markets, October 2018).
 
The DuraGraft product addresses unmet medical needs in both of these clinical markets. DuraGraft is a CE-marked endothelial damage inhibitor that protects free vascular grafts and endothelium against ischemic injury. The product is approved for use in Europe for graft protection and preservation during bypass (cardiac and peripheral) and other vascular surgeries. The company is currently working with local distributors of cardiovascular disease-related products, in accordance with local regulatory requirements, to sell and increase the market share of DuraGraft in Europe, South America, Australia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Far East. As of the date of this filing, the Company anticipates the submission of a de novo 510k application to the U.S. FDA for the use of DuraGraft in CABG procedures in the 4th quarter of 2021. In anticipation of the filing of the de novo 510k application for DuraGraft, the company plans to submit a pre-submission document to the FDA that describes the strategy for demonstrating the clinical safety and efficacy of the product.


Krillase
 
Through our acquisition of the Krillase technology from ACB Holding AB, we have purchased a European Union researched and evaluated protease therapeutic platform that has the potential for use in the treatment of chronic wounds/burns, and other clinical applications. Krillase may be classified as a biological drug, however, it has been classified as a Class III medical device in Europe for treating chronic wounds.
 
Krillase, derived from Antarctic krill, shrimp-like crustaceans, is a combination of endo and exopeptidases that safely and efficiently breaks down organic material. The mix of proteinases and peptidases in Krillase helps the Antarctic krill digest and break down its food in the extremely cold Antarctic environment. As a result, this specialized collection of enzymes provides a unique biochemical “cutting” capability. As a “biochemical knife,” Krillase can potentially break down organic matter, such as necrotic tissue, thrombogenic material, and biofilms produced by microorganisms. As such, it may be useful in the mitigation or treatment of multiple disease states in humans. For example, Krillase may dissolve arterial thrombogenic plaque safely and efficiently, promote faster healing and support the grafting of skin for the treatment of chronic wounds and burns, and reduce bacterial biofilms associated with poor oral health in humans and animals.


We have acquired a Krillase-based product pipeline that is focused on developing products that treat several conditions across the critical care market. Itemized below is a breakdown of our projected Krillase development pipeline:
 

● | MB101 – Therapy for complex wounds and burns 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
● | MB102 – Therapy for acute ischemic stroke 
● | MB104 – Therapy for deep vein thrombosis 
● | MB105 – Therapy for dissolving plaque and biofilms on teeth 

 
Krillase received medical device status in the European Union for debridement of deep partial and full-thickness wounds in hospitalized patients, on July 19, 2005.
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company continues to evaluate commercial, clinical, research, and regulatory considerations involved in marketing our Krillase-based product line. Our commercial strategy in developing this product line is two-fold:
 

● | First, leverage and maximize near-term revenue generating opportunities with products for commercial or clinical applications that have low regulatory risk, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Second, develop products for applications of the Krillase platform that address unmet medical needs or address medical market needs better than existing products in the marketplace, in clinical applications that have higher regulatory risk, but significant commercial potential. 

 
We anticipate finalizing our development, operation and commercial strategy regarding the Krillase platform by 2022.


Our Competitive Strength
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths will enable us to compete effectively:
 
Our cytoprotective platform provides a significant and substantial competitive advantage as:
 

● | DuraGraft, CE marked in Europe, is a “first-in-class” product and is approved for sale in Europe for vein graft preservation. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The extensive research that went into the development of the DuraGraft product has generated significant proprietary knowhow regarding the mechanisms of cellular protection from ischemia. We plan to leverage this knowhow in the generation of additional products and product formulations for cellular protection and tissue and organ transplantation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Our Krillase platform provides a significant and substantial competitive advantage as:
 

● | Preliminary studies in Europe have shown Krillase to achieve superior wound healing effects in treatment of necrotic leg ulcers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our patent protected unique mixture of highly efficient endo and exopeptidases extracted from the digestive tract of the Antarctic Krill is difficult to reproduce artificially. 

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy is premised on integrating the acquisition of the Somah assets and future capital raising offerings, either public or private.
 
We will strive to grow our business by pursuing the following key growth strategies:
 

● | Continue to grow the base business through the current market channels for DuraGraft in Europe and utilize the base of key opinion leaders to expand the sale of DuraGraft into additional markets globally, explore further use of the cytoprotective platform for new research and clinical applications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of DuraGraft and related Somah products in the United States. 
● | Complete the research, development, and begin to commercialize our Krillase platform through the development of (i) manufacturing and distribution in Europe and South America of a Krillase wound debridement and healing product, and (ii) explore additional Krillase-based commercial and clinical applications. 
● | Expand our product portfolio through the identification and acquisition of cell preservation and additional life science assets.

The strategic plans described above will require capital. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the capital that we will need to execute our plans or that capital, in addition to the amount we raised in the Private Placement, whether through securities offerings, either private or public, will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to raise sufficient funds could cause us to scale back our development and growth plans or discontinue them altogether.
 
Patent Portfolio
 
Upon our acquisition of the Somahlution, LLC (“Somahlution”) assets, we acquired all of the Somahlution intellectual property relating to the Somahlution products, including patents rights and trademarks relating to DuraGraft. In addition, prior to the closing of the Somahlution asset acquisition, in certain countries, we paid the costs relating to the filing and registration of patent applications and were granted ownership rights to DuraGraft patents issued in those countries.
 
As a result of our 2018 acquisition of the Krillase platform assets from ACB Holding AB, a Swedish corporation, we acquired patents and patent applications relating to the Krillase technology.
 
Currently, we are in the process of conducting a thorough and comprehensive, world-wide inventory of our patent and trademark positions with respect to both our DuraGraft and Krillase assets.
 
We own the internet domain names, www.marizyme.com and www.somahlution.com, which are our primary operating websites. We own additional websites which are reserved for future operations. The information contained in our websites is not incorporated by reference in this annual report. 
 
We generally control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we sold products do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad were adequate or that competition will not independently develop similar technology.
 
Impact of the Coronavirus
 
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, originating in Wuhan, China, and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect our prospective future revenues, and our operations and those of third parties with whom we might interact, including by causing disruptions in the development of our product candidates, product marketing efforts and the conduct of current and expected future clinical trials.
 
In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the operations of the FDA and other health authorities, including such authorities in Europe, which could result in delays of reviews and approvals, including with respect to our product candidates and our plans to submit a Q-sub clinical proposal to the FDA for supporting an additional clinical study if required for the DuraGraft product. While there have been no specific notices of delay from federal or foreign government authorities, potential interruptions, delays, or changes to the operations of the FDA, or of any foreign authority with which we might interact, might impact the approval of any applications we plan and will need to file in the future.
 
We have not developed a COVID-19 contingency plan to address the potential challenges and risks presented by this pandemic. If we were to prepare such a plan, there could be no assurance that it would be effective in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 virus.

Competition
 
DuraGraft is a product that can minimize vein graft disease and vein graft failure, leading to significantly improved outcomes for patients undergoing CABG surgeries. Our peer-reviewed and published data has demonstrated DuraGraft’s superiority over “standard of care” vein or arterial graft wetting solutions such as saline, buffered solutions, and autologous patient blood in maintaining vascular endothelial cell structure and function. Unlike DuraGraft, these other wetting solutions do not protect against ischemic injury and prevent ischemic reperfusion injury. Additionally, they are also associated with some solution tissue incompatibility as well.
 
DuraGraft was the first product approved for its indication in vascular surgeries, including CABG, peripheral, and other vascular surgeries. Since its CE mark approval, we know of no other products that have undergone no randomized clinical trials, regulatory review or are CE marked for this indication. There is a compounded product, TiProtect, that is available from Franz Kohler laboratories in Germany. As far as we know, this product has not been CE marked approved and is used cold (and as such is inconsistent with normal CABG surgical practice). To date there is no clinical data supporting its use and comes with two significant warnings regarding its use. Its availability and use are limited to Spain and some surgeons in Germany.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
The FDA, Competent Authorities and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of medical device products such as those the Company has developed and is developing. These agencies and federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labelling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of the Company’s medical device product candidates. To comply with the regulatory requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which the Company is marketing or seeking to market and subsequently sell its products, the Company is establishing processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch (including post market surveillance) of its products and to position those products in order to gain market share.
 
We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
 
U.S. Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending Market Authorizations, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a medical device may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:



● | completion of design control activities (including design verification activities such as pre-clinical laboratory tests, engineering tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) regulations and 21 CFR part 820 regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which must become approved before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, of the study protocol and informed consent forms for the clinical site before each trial may be initiated. Multiple sites may necessitate the involvement of multiple IRBs and submissions; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
● | submission to the FDA of a Marketing Application (510k, De Novo, PMA, etc.) which would include the study reports of the clinical trials, pre-clinical testing, design verification and validation activities, labeling, etc. as well as other required sections to be included in the Marketing Authorization; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) or PAI (Pre-approved Inspection) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the medical device’s identity, quality; and 
● | FDA clearance of the medical device.

Pre-clinical Studies
 
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the medical device product’s chemistry, engineering testing, stability, biocompatibility (including toxicity) and shipping (container closure), as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IDE sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, testing, data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IDE. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IDE is submitted. An IDE automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IDE sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IDE may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the use of the investigational device to human subjects pursuant to a clinical protocol, under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives or endpoints of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA under the IDE. In addition, an IRB (central or at each institution participating in the clinical trial) must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.


Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the medical device has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

-

Marketing Approval
 
The results of the pre-clinical studies and engineering testing, together with detailed information relating to the product’s composition, manufacture, quality controls and proposed labeling, among other things, and assuming successful completion of clinical testing (if required) are submitted to the FDA as part of a MA requesting clearance to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an MA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Medical Device User Fee Act (“MDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect are dependent on type of submission, and typically the FDA has a goal that ranges between 100 – 300 days from the date of “filing” of a standard MA for the substantive review. This total review typically takes longer from the date of submission because the FDA has approximately15 days to make a “filing” decision. Additionally, if during the filing decision or the substantive review FDA determines a sponsor need provide additional information (AI), the sponsor has 180 days to provide requested information and during such time, the FDA review clock is halted.
 
Before clearing a MA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not clear an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMPs requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before clearing a MA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs requirements.
 
After evaluating the MA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue clearance in a form consistent with the type of application. A complete response letter must contain a statement of specific items that prevent the FDA from approving the application and will also contain conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the MA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes clearance to commercially market the medical device product with specific instructions for use for specific indications.
 
Even if the FDA clears a product, it may limit the approved indications for use the of product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Medical device products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA clearance are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.


The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a MA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.


In addition, medical device manufacturers and other entities involved in the design, manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMPs compliance.


Once approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions. Other potential consequences include, but are not limited to:



● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 


10
--


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending sponsor MAs or supplements to approved MAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, products, if deemed adulterated, can lead to serious consequences as set forth above as well as civil and criminal penalties.


Foreign Government Regulation
 
To the extent that any of the Company’s product candidates are to be approved and sold in a foreign country, The Company may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
In order to market the Company’s products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions (e.g., in Europe, the United Kingdom and Switzerland), a sponsor must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medical device products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are currently two types of marketing authorizations in the EU are Medical Device Directive (MDD 93/42/EEC) and Medical Device Regulation (EU 2017/745). As of May 26, 2021, the MDR repeals MDD and all new marketing authorizations must meet the requirements of MDR. The activities associated with MA approval are conducted by authorized Notified Bodies on behalf of the EU competent authorities.


Before granting the MA, the NB makes an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. In order to make this determination, the Sponsor submits a Technical File or Design Dossier for approval.

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of medical device products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the medical device industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws.


The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between device manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if anyone purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.


Additionally, the intent standard under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. Companies also have been prosecuted for allegedly violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act as a result of impermissible arrangements between companies and healthcare practitioners or as a result of the provision of remuneration by the companies to the healthcare practitioners. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) of 1996 created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes created under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 
The Company may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which The Company conducts its business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule, published on January 25, 2013, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. In the EU, similar privacy requirements have been implemented under EU Law General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016/679). These requirements include provisions related to the processing of personal data of individuals within the EEA and also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which the Company obtains regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use the Company’s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of the Company’s products. Sales of any products for which The Company receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will, therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover The Company’s product candidates could reduce physician utilization of The Company’s products once approved and have a material adverse effect on The Company’s sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable The Company to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on The Company’s investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical device product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical device product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require The Company to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of The Company’s products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.


In the EEA, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical device products, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical device products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider the Company’s products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover The Company’s products after regulatory approval or clearance, or if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow The Company to sell its products at a profit.


Healthcare Reform
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that includes establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. Since its enactment, the U.S. federal government has delayed or suspended the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA.

The Company expects that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement and additional downward pressure on the price that The Company receives for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent The Company from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize The Company’s drugs.
 
Additionally, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.


The Company expects that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for The Company’s products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
 
Animal Health Business
 
The development, approval and sale of animal health products are governed by the laws and regulations of each country in which we intend to seek approval, where necessary, to market and subsequently sell our non-drug products. To comply with these regulatory requirements, we are establishing processes and resources to provide oversight of the development, approval processes and launch of our products and to position those products in order to gain market share in each respective market.


Certain U.S. federal regulatory agencies are charged with oversight and regulatory authority of animal health products in the United States. These agencies, depending on the product and its intended use, may include the FDA, the USDA and the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission may, in the case of non-drug products, regulate the marketing and advertising claims being made.


Labeling
 
The FDA plays a significant role in regulating the labeling, advertising and promotion of animal health products. This is also true of regulatory agencies in the EU and other territories. In addition, advertising and promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and approved by the applicable agency. We will conduct a review of advertising and promotional material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we eventually may sell its product candidates.
Other Regulatory Considerations
 
We believe regulatory rules relating to human food safety, food additives, or drug residues in food will not apply to the products we currently are developing because our animal health product candidates are not intended for use in production animals, and our non-prescription products are not regulated by section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which the FDA is authorized to administer.

Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

● | Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); 
● | Submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and 
● | Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. 

 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 
In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We do not believe that we are or will become subject to any environmental laws or regulations of the United States. While our products and business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our products or potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Bankruptcy or Similar Proceedings
 
There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding pertaining to the Company.
 
Reorganizations, Purchase or Sale of Assets
 
There have been no other material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, purchases or sales of a significant amount of assets not done in the ordinary course of business pertaining to the Company.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements, or Labor Contracts
 
The Company owns, through the acquisitions of Krillase and DuraGraft, various patents, trademarks and other intangibles.
