ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Gannett Co., Inc. ("Gannett", "we", "us", "our", or the "Company") is a subscription-led and digitally focused media and marketing solutions company committed to empowering communities to thrive. We aim to be the premiere source for clarity, connections, and solutions within our communities. Our strategy is focused on driving audience growth and engagement by delivering deeper content experiences to our consumers, while offering the products and marketing expertise our advertisers desire. The execution of this strategy is expected to enable the Company to continue its evolution from a more traditional print media business to a digitally focused content platform. Until November 19, 2019, our corporate name was New Media Investment Group Inc. ("New Media") and Gannett Co., Inc. was a separate publicly traded company. On November 19, 2019, New Media completed its acquisition of Gannett Co., Inc. (which was renamed Gannett Media Corp. and is referred to as “Legacy Gannett”). In connection with the acquisition, New Media changed its name to Gannett Co., Inc. and assumed Legacy Gannett's ticker symbol "GCI" (having previously traded under "NEWM").
Our current portfolio of media assets includes USA TODAY, local media organizations in 46 states in the U.S., and Newsquest, a wholly owned subsidiary operating in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") with more than 120 local news media brands. Gannett also owns the digital marketing services companies ReachLocal, Inc. ("ReachLocal"), UpCurve, Inc. ("UpCurve"), and WordStream, Inc. ("WordStream"), which are marketed under the LOCALiQ brand, and runs the largest media-owned events business in the U.S., USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures.
Through USA TODAY, our local property network, and Newsquest, Gannett delivers high-quality, trusted content where and when consumers want to engage with it on virtually any device or platform. Additionally, the Company has strong relationships with hundreds of thousands of local and national businesses in both our U.S. and U.K. markets due to our large local and national sales forces and a robust advertising and digital marketing solutions product suite. The Company reports in two operating segments, Publishing and Digital Marketing Solutions, plus a corporate and other category. A full description of our segments is included in Note 14 — Segment reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has made both internal and external investments to align with the shift in spending habits to digital products by both consumers and marketers. In 2020, total Digital advertising and marketing services revenues were $808.4 million, or 24% of our total revenues. Our U.S. media network, which includes USA TODAY and our local properties, has more than 4,350 journalists. We expect to and are invested in growing the number of journalists, as we seek to accelerate growth of a subscription-led business model, anchored on high-quality, original, impactful journalism. Our U.S. media network averaged 150 million(1) unique visitors monthly during 2020 who access content through desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. In the U.K., Newsquest is a publishing and digital leader with approximately 655 journalists and a network of websites that attracts over 39 million unique visitors monthly. As of December 31, 2020 we had approximately 1.1 million digital-only subscribers, up 29% year over year.
Publishing Segment
 Our Publishing segment comprises the following core products:
•253 daily media brands, including USA TODAY and our local property network in the U.S., with total paid circulation of over 2.6 million and Sunday circulation of 3.0 million; 
•308 weekly media brands (published up to three times per week) with total circulation of approximately 1.6 million; 
•375 locally-focused websites, which extend our businesses onto digital platforms;
•USA TODAY Group, which includes USATODAY.com and its mobile applications, our sports network (owned and operated as well as affiliates), and Reviewed.com, an affiliate marketing business; 
•121 daily and weekly news media brands with related digital platforms as well as over 100 magazines in the U.K.; and
•Our community events platform, USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures.
In addition to our core products, we also opportunistically produce niche publications that address specific local market interests such as recreation, sports, healthcare, and real estate. Many of our publications are located in small and mid-size markets where we are often the primary provider of comprehensive local market news and information. Our content is primarily devoted to topics we believe are highly relevant and of interest to our audiences such as local news and politics, community and regional events, youth sports, opinion and editorial pages, local schools, obituaries, weddings, and crime news.
More than 80% of our daily media brands have been published for more than 100 years. We believe the longevity of our publications demonstrates the value and relevance of the local information we provide and has created a strong foundation of reader loyalty and a highly-recognized media brand name in each community we serve. 
Since its introduction in 1982, USA TODAY has been a cornerstone of the national media landscape under its recognizable and respected brand. It also serves as the foundation for our newsroom network, the USA TODAY NETWORK, which allows for content sharing capabilities across our local and national markets. Since 1918, our USA TODAY NETWORK newsrooms have won 96 Pulitzer Prizes. Most recently, the Louisville Courier Journal won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for breaking news reporting for its coverage of the flurry of pardons and commutations given by Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin during his final days in office. This followed three wins in 2018, when the USA TODAY NETWORK was awarded Pulitzer Prizes for local reporting, editorial writing, and explanatory journalism, highlighting our ability to integrate in-depth reporting and cutting-edge technology. 
The scale of our consumer audience across the Publishing segment makes us an attractive marketing partner to various local and national businesses trying to reach consumers. We are the leading news media publisher in the U.S. in terms of circulation and have the fifth largest digital audience in the News and Information category, based on December 2020 Comscore Media Metrics; per those metrics, our content reaches more people digitally than Fox News, CBSnews.com, New York Times Digital, BuzzFeed.com, or WashingtonPost.com.(1)
•In our U.S. local property network, the combined average daily print readership is approximately 6.9 million on Sundays and 5.6 million daily Monday through Saturday, while the digital audience reached 74.6 million(1) monthly unique visitors, on average, in 2020. At USA TODAY, print readership averages 2.7 million daily Monday to Friday, while the digital audience reached approximately 105.1 million(1) monthly unique visitors, on average, in 2020. While our print audience tends to skew to an older demographic, our digital audience skews younger as evidenced by 52%(1) of the total U.S. digital millennial audience (ages 18 - 34) accessing our USA TODAY NETWORK content monthly.
•In the U.K., our wholly-owned subsidiary, Newsquest, has a total average print readership of over 5.1 million every week. Newsquest’s digital audience in 2020 had an average of 39 million monthly unique users.
The Publishing segment generates revenue primarily through advertising and subscriptions to our print and digital publications and, to a lesser extent, commercial printing and distribution. The USA TODAY NETWORK has developed an efficient operating model utilizing a single content management platform and integrated shared support for back-office operations such as accounting and finance, content design and layout services, print and digital creative development, and certain sales and service platforms. We also strive to manage production and distribution efficiently across our entire newsroom network. 
Advertising and marketing: In 2020, Publishing segment Advertising and marketing services revenues of $1.410 billion, which represents 46% of total Publishing segment revenues, down from 50% in 2019. 
We track our Print advertising revenues in three primary categories: local, national, and classified. Below are descriptions of the three categories:
•Local advertising is associated with local merchants or locally owned businesses. Ads run in our print products, such as our daily or non-daily publications, and are either run-of-press (ROP) or preprinted inserts (typically stand-alone, multiple page fliers inserted into daily and Sunday print products);
•National advertising is principally associated with advertisers who are promoting national products or brands. Examples are retailers, commercial banks, airlines, and telecommunications. It also includes national brands that advertise in our local markets. Similar to local advertising, ads are either ROP or preprinted inserts; and
•Classified advertising includes major categories such as legal, obituaries, automotive, employment, and real estate or rentals. Classified advertising is published in the classified or other sections within the publication.
We track Digital advertising and marketing services revenues in three main categories: digital media, digital classified, and digital marketing services. Below are descriptions of these three categories:
•Digital media represents all display advertising either delivered on our products or off-platform on partner channels such as Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News;
•Digital classified encompasses digital advertising revenues associated with our classified partnerships, including auto (cars.com for a portion of 2020), employment (ZipRecruiter, Recruitology), and real estate (Homes.com) as well as legal, and obituaries; and 
•Digital marketing services represents our integrated marketing platform helping local businesses build their online presence, drive awareness and leads, manage and nurture leads, and measure which activities are most effective.
Our advertising teams employ a multi-platform approach to advertising sales under the LOCALiQ brand, which can be specifically tailored to the individual needs of advertisers from small, locally-owned merchants to large, complex businesses. We believe local and national advertisers find it challenging to manage the complexity of their media budgets, particularly on the digital side, and are seeking to reach a shifting audience while also desiring to influence attitudes and behavior at each stage of the purchase path. Our diverse sales force, unique industry scale, and broad portfolio of print and digital advertising and marketing products position us well to solve these challenges. Through our media planning process, we present advertisers with targeted, integrated solutions that help them reach this shifting audience.
The Publishing segment's Advertising and marketing services revenues are subject to moderate seasonality primarily due to fluctuations in advertising volumes. Our Advertising and marketing services revenues are typically highest during the fourth quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the first quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.
Circulation: In 2020, Publishing segment Circulation revenues of $1.392 billion comprised 45% of total Publishing segment revenues, up from 39% in 2019, which makes it our single largest revenue category. In a trend generally consistent within the domestic publishing industry, print circulation volumes declined in 2020. Circulation revenues in the U.S. are derived from our All Access Content Subscription Model, single-copy sales, and digital-only subscriptions. Circulation revenues at Newsquest are more centered on single-copy sales, with a larger portion of weekly paid-for titles and free titles as compared to our U.S. publications.
Our All Access Content Subscription Model in our local markets includes access to our content via multiple platforms including websites, smartphone and tablet applications, and e-newspapers, with subscription prices that vary according to the frequency of delivery of the print edition. Also available to subscribers are digital-only or digital-plus Sunday subscriptions. As of December 31, 2020, we had 2.5 million daily subscribers. We offer our customers EZ Pay, a payment system which automatically deducts subscription payments from customers' credit cards or bank accounts. We see better subscriber retention with our EZ Pay customers. At the end of 2020, EZ Pay was used by 56% of all subscribers across our U.S. local property network (not including USA TODAY).
Growing our digital-only subscribers is a strategic priority and, in 2020, our digital-only subscribers increased by 29% on a total Company basis to approximately 1.1 million. Our primary digital subscriber acquisition strategies include converting our organic traffic through on-platform promotion, paywalls and dynamic meters for our premium content, conversion through our freemium funnel, paid social, and email marketing. A variety of pricing strategies are used throughout the year, including discounted introductory periods and sales, to encourage trial and habituation before transitioning to the full price rate. In the U.S. local markets, approximately 86% of Circulation revenues are derived from our All Access Content Subscription Model and digital-only subscriptions. 
In addition to the subscription model in our U.S. local markets, single-copy print editions continue to be sold at retail outlets and account for approximately 11% of daily and 19% of Sunday net paid circulation volume. Approximately 66% of the net paid circulation volumes of USA TODAY are generated by single-copy sales at retail outlets, vending machines, or hotels that provide copies to their guests. The remainder is generated by home and office delivery, mail, educational, and other sales.
Events: USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures, our events and promotions business, was started in late 2015 by leveraging our local brands to create community focused events in the markets we serve. In 2020, USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures produced over 250 events for the Company with a collective attendance over 700,000. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all events in 2020 were held virtually, building digital communities for consumers to create experiences with one another. Despite the virtual pivot, USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures was able to maintain 88% of its 2019 pro forma revenue performance.
Our signature event series produced across many of our markets includes the nation's largest high school athlete recognition program and the official community's choice awards for dozens of markets across the country. We were also one of the largest active producers of endurance events in North America as well as one of the largest race timing companies in the U.S. Additional offerings include a variety of themed expos focused on target audiences, including men, women, seniors, and young families, as well as recognition awards for social influencers in categories such as beauty. USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures also offers white label event services for retailers and other media companies.
USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures revenues are generated primarily through sponsorship sales, race registrations, ticket sales, and print and digital advertising.
Production and Distribution: Gannett Publishing Services ("GPS") owns and operates 45 print facilities. Our print facilities produce 21 publications on average and are generally located within 120 miles of the communities served. By clustering our production resources or outsourcing where cost beneficial, we are able to reduce the operating costs of our publications while increasing the quality of our small and mid-size market publications that would typically not otherwise have access to high quality production facilities. We also believe we are able to reduce future capital expenditure needs by having fewer overall pressrooms and buildings. We believe our superior production quality is critical to maintaining and enhancing our position as the leading provider of local news coverage in the markets we serve. 
GPS leverages our existing assets, including employee talent and experience, physical plants and equipment, and our vast national and local distribution networks. GPS is particularly focused on maximizing our geographic footprint to most efficiently produce and transport our printed product. GPS is responsible for internal and external printing, packaging, and distribution. The distribution of our daily newspapers is typically outsourced to independent, locally based, third-party distributors that also distribute a majority of our weekly newspapers and non-newspaper publications. We continuously evaluate lower cost options for newspaper delivery. In addition, certain of our shopper and weekly publications are delivered via the U.S. Postal Service.
Newsquest operates its publishing activities in a similar manner to GPS, through regional centers to maximize the use of management, finance, printing, and personnel resources. This regional approach allows the business to leverage a variety of back-office and administrative activities to optimize financial results and enables the group to offer readers and advertisers a range of attractive products across the market.
Competition: Our U.S. and U.K. publishing operations and affiliated digital platforms compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend. Our Publishing operations also compete for circulation and readership against other news and information outlets and amateur content creators. Each of our publications compete for advertising revenues to varying degrees with traditional media outlets such as direct mail, yellow pages, radio, outdoor advertising, broadcast and cable television, magazines, local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers, and other print and online media sources, including local blogs. We also increasingly compete with digital and social media companies for advertising revenues. 
Development of opportunities in, and competition from, digital and social media, including websites, tablet, mobile, and social products continues to increase. There is very little barrier to entry and limited capital requirements for new companies to enter the market with competitive digital products. Additionally, we are generally not compensated for the use of our original content by third-party digital products and social platforms. 
The Company expects to continue to expand its audience reach in the digital media industry through internal audience development efforts, content distribution programs, acquisitions, and partnerships to protect its audience market share. Additionally, the Company expects to continue to improve its suite of advertising and marketing services products through both internal development, acquisitions, and partnerships to protect its advertising market share.
Government Regulation: We are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations in numerous jurisdictions within the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business. These laws, rules and regulations cover several diverse areas including environmental matters, employee health and safety, data and privacy protection and anti-trust provisions. We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with governmental regulations did not have during fiscal 2020, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
Environmental Regulation: The Company is committed to protecting the environment. Our goal is to ensure our production and distribution facilities comply with federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and to incorporate appropriate environmental practices and standards in our operations. We are one of the industry leaders in the use of recycled newsprint. During 2020, 14% of our domestic newsprint purchases contained recycled content, with average recycled content of 31%.
Our operations use inks, solvents, and fuels. The use, management, and disposal of these substances are sometimes regulated by environmental agencies. We retain a corporate environmental legal consultant who, along with internal and outside counsel, provides advice on regulatory compliance and preventive measures. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the health and safety of our employees based upon existing facts presently known to us. Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to 
the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other related activities has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations but has been accomplished to date without having a material adverse effect on our operations. While it is difficult to estimate the timing and ultimate costs to be incurred due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, and technology, based on information currently known to us and insurance procured with respect to certain environmental matters, we do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Our operations involve risks in these areas, however, and we cannot assure we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.
Raw Materials: Newsprint, which is the basic raw material used in our print publications, has been and may continue to be subject to significant price changes from time to time. For example, in the first half of 2018, many Canadian producers were subjected to significant anti-dumping and countervailing duties upon importation of newsprint into the U.S. which resulted in higher newsprint prices and tighter supply from the Canadian producers. Prices came down in the second half of the year as the duties were eliminated by the International Trade Commission in September 2018, but this example serves as a reminder of the price and supply volatility that can impact the market. Our ability to supply the needs of our publishing operations depends upon the continuing availability of newsprint at an acceptable price, and the results of operations of our Publishing segment may be impacted significantly by changes in newsprint prices. We generally maintain only a 45 to 55-day inventory of newsprint. The availability and price of newsprint is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which are described more fully under "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We purchase newsprint primarily from 16 domestic and global suppliers. During 2020, our total newsprint consumption was approximately 195,030 metric tons, including consumption by our owned and operated print sites, third-party printing sites, and Newsquest. Newsprint consumption in 2020 was 44% higher than in 2019 primarily due to the acquisition of Legacy Gannett.
Joint Operating Agencies: Our publishing subsidiaries in Detroit and York each participate in a joint operating agency ("JOA"). In each instance, the JOA performs the production, sales, distribution, and back office functions for our subsidiaries and the publisher of another publication pursuant to a joint operating agreement. Operating results for the Detroit and York JOAs are fully consolidated along with a charge for the minority partners' share of profits. 
Digital Marketing Solutions Segment
The mission of our Digital Marketing Solutions ("DMS") segment is to deliver customers to local businesses. DMS is currently comprised of three brands that are expected to be integrated in 2021 under the banner LOCALiQ DMS :
•ReachLocal, which was founded in 2004 and acquired in 2016, helps local businesses advertise online to find customers; 
•UpCurve, which provides cloud-based products with expert guidance and support; and
•WordStream, which was acquired by Gannett in 2018, is a provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for local and regional businesses and agencies to optimize their digital advertising campaigns. 
We believe local businesses want a single, unified solution to solve their digital marketing needs. Our DMS products and solutions can be separated into four main categories: 
•Build online presence (websites, local listings, search engine optimization, social media management, live chat);
•Drive consumer awareness and business leads ("leads") with advertising (search engine marketing, social advertising, mobile advertising, display advertising, video and over the top advertising, targeted email marketing);
•Manage and nurture leads (lead alert tools, lead management, lead engagement and automation, job management); and
•Measure what works and optimize future marketing campaigns (conversion analytics, cross-channel optimization, lead attribution, phone tracking, campaign reporting).
We run an efficient operating model by leveraging our entire sales organization, who utilize a single customer relationship management tool and service all clients and campaigns through our LOCALiQ platform. The LOCALiQ platform has centralized post-sales functions and utilizes integrated shared support for back-office operations such as accounting and finance. 
Products: Digital marketing requires a holistic view of how online presence, advertising and conversion efforts work together to get results. Our solutions work across the USA TODAY NETWORK and major online platforms such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Snap and others. Our product portfolio offers a simple all-in-one platform powered by artificial intelligence and service experts that grows and adapts with the needs of local business owners. For example, some businesses might need to significantly improve their website and focus on converting sales leads, while others may need to focus on 
building awareness of their business and driving more leads to their site and social pages. LOCALiQ DMS identifies the biggest opportunities and provides solutions by recommending the right mix of product platform features and measures results. 
We have a proprietary set of technologies that enable a business to receive a score on their overall marketing efforts, show them how they stack up against their competitors, and recommend a comprehensive set of solutions to help them achieve their goals. This customized solution is sold as a subscription to our LOCALiQ DMS platform. This platform removes the concerns of unexpected overages and misaligned goals and allows us to set performance-based pricing. The platform optimizes to produce the best results for the business and service experts are assigned to assist with each account, as needed.  
•Our online presence solutions offer high conversion websites, with e-commerce, custom content creation to empower businesses to look professional, and human or bot-enabled live chat which ties into our lead conversion tools. These products are designed to work in concert with our digital advertising products with a goal of enhancing clients’ marketing return on investment.
•Our online advertising products include award-winning technology for bidding and budget management that cover more than 90% of the U.S. online audience. They also include patent-pending machine learning algorithms which optimize multiple advertising channels and campaigns toward a goal with a single budget. Search engine marketing, which is recorded as Advertising and marketing services revenues accounted for 56% of our DMS segment's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020.
•Our lead conversion software is a marketing automation platform that includes tools for capturing web traffic information and converting leads into new customers for clients. We provide tools designed to significantly improve the conversion of leads to customers and to help stay top-of-mind during the prospect's decision-making process by using integrated marketing automation to send new prospects targeted e-mails and alerts reminding them to follow up on each lead. Our lead conversion software also provides reports to show how many leads they are getting from each marketing source and other important business insights. 
•Offer additional cloud-based software solutions, offered as a channel partner, include a customer relationship management solution tailored for small and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs"), a market-leading collaboration and productivity tool, and voice-over-IP software. Our software solutions are available in North America and our lead conversion software is available in all of our markets.
Distribution: We deliver our suite of products and solutions to local businesses through a combination of our proprietary technology platform, our sales force, and select third-party agencies and resellers. Our DMS segment has sales operations in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K. Approximately 94% of our DMS segment revenues are generated in North America and the remaining 6% from other international markets. All DMS segment revenues are digital revenues. 
Competition: The market for local online advertising solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. The market is highly fragmented as there are a number of smaller companies which provide internet marketing services at highly competitive prices and, increasingly, we compete with SMB marketing providers who offer solutions tailored for specific verticals. In addition, the online publishers that we utilize for clients, such as Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, generally offer their products and services through self-service platforms. Many traditional offline media companies also offer online advertising solutions and have large, direct sales forces and digital publishing properties.
Termination of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement
For the year ended December 31, 2020, we were externally managed and advised by FIG LLC (the "Manager"), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC ("Fortress") pursuant to a management agreement. On August 5, 2019, in connection with the entry into the agreement to acquire Legacy Gannett, the Company and the Manager entered into the Amended and Restated Management and Advisory Agreement (the "Amended Management Agreement"), which became effective upon the closing of the acquisition on November 19, 2019. The Amended Management Agreement (i) established a termination date for the Manager’s services of December 31, 2021, in lieu of annual renewals of the term; (ii) reduced the "incentive fee" payable under the Amended Management Agreement from 25% to 17.5% for the remainder of the term; (iii) reduced by 50% the number of options that would otherwise be issuable in connection with the issuance of shares as consideration for the acquisition, and imposed a premium on the exercise price; (iv) eliminated the Manager’s right to receive options in connection with future equity raises by the Company; and (v) eliminated certain payments otherwise due at or after the end of the term of the prior management agreement.
In connection with entering into the Amended Management Agreement and the consummation of the acquisition, the Company issued to the Manager 4,205,607 shares of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") and granted to the Manager options to acquire 3,163,264 shares of Company Common Stock. The Manager was restricted from 
selling the issued shares until the expiration of the Amended Management Agreement, or otherwise upon a change in control and certain other extraordinary events. The options have an exercise price of $15.50 and become exercisable upon the first trading day immediately following the first 20 consecutive trading day period in which the closing price of the Company Common Stock (on its principal U.S. national securities exchange) is at or above $20 per share (subject to adjustment) and also upon a change in control and certain other extraordinary events.
On December 21, 2020, we entered into a Termination Agreement (the "Termination Agreement") with the Manager providing for the early termination of the Amended Management Agreement, effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 31, 2020. Upon termination of the Amended Management Agreement, the Manager ceased providing external management services to the Company, and the Manager no longer is the employer of the person serving in the role of Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In connection with the Termination Agreement, the Company made a one-time cash payment of $30.4 million to the Manager. In addition, all transfer restrictions contained in the Amended Management Agreement on shares of our Common Stock owned by the Manager, or acquired by the Manager upon the exercise of stock options to acquire Common Stock, lapsed. In connection with the termination of our relationship with the Manager, we extended offers of employment to certain employees of the Manager or its affiliates who provided services to the Company, including to our Chief Executive Officer. Certain indemnification and other obligations in the Amended Management Agreement survived the termination of our relationship with the Manager.
Strategy
Gannett’s vision is to be the premiere source for clarity, connections and solutions within our communities. We are committed to a subscription-led business strategy, that drives audience growth and engagement by delivering deeper content experiences to our consumers, while offering the products and marketing expertise our advertisers desire. The execution of this strategy is expected to allow the Company to continue its evolution from a more traditional print media business to a digitally focused content platform.
We intend to create stockholder value through a variety of methods including organic growth driven by our consumer and business-to-business strategies as well as through paying down the debt assumed to consummate the acquisition of Legacy Gannett. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to accomplish any of these strategic initiatives. The key elements of our strategy include:
Accelerating digital subscriber growth
The broad reach of our newsroom network, linking leading national journalism at USA TODAY, our local property network in 46 states in the U.S. and Newsquest in the U.K. with more than 120 local media brands, gives us the ability to deepen our relationships with consumers at both the national and local levels. We bring consumers local news and information that impacts their day-to-day lives while keeping them informed of the national events that impact their country. We believe this local content is not readily obtainable elsewhere, and we are able to deliver that content to our customers across multiple print and digital platforms. As such, a key element of our consumer strategy is growing our paid digital-only subscriber base. We also expect to launch new digital subscription offerings tailored to specific users. 
Driving digital marketing services growth by engaging more clients in a subscriber relationship
We are now of significant digital scale, with unique reach at both the national and local community levels. We expect to leverage our integrated sales structure and lead generation strategy to continue to aggressively expand our digital marketing services business into our local markets, both domestically and internationally. Given our extensive client base and volume of digital campaigns, we will also use data and insights to inform new and dynamic advertising products that we believe will deliver superior results. 
Optimizing our traditional businesses across print and advertising
We will continue to drive the profitability of our traditional print operations through economies of scale, process improvements, and optimizations. We are focused on optimizing our pricing and improving customer service for our print subscribers. Print advertising continues to offer a compelling branding opportunity across our network due to our scale and unique reach at both the national and local community levels. 
Prioritizing investments into growth businesses that have significant potential and support our vision
By leveraging our unique footprint, trusted brands, and media reach, we identify, experiment, and invest in potential growth businesses. USA TODAY NETWORK Ventures is a strong example of one such experiment that has grown significantly since its founding in 2015. During 2020, the Company was able to successfully pivot to hosting its events virtually, hosting over 250 events and maintaining 88% of USA TODAY NETWORK Venture's revenues compared to 2019.
Building on our inclusive and diverse culture to center around meaningful purpose, individual growth and customer focus
Inclusion, Diversity and Equity are core pillars of our organization and influence all that we do, from recruiting, development and retention, to day-to-day operations including hiring, onboarding, education, leadership training and professional development. We have published our inclusion goals for 2025 and our efforts underway to progress toward them and expect to publish our first workforce diversity report in the first quarter of 2021. We believe aligning our culture around empowering our communities to thrive and putting our customers at the center of everything we do will provide the foundation for our broader strategic efforts. 
Challenges
As a publisher of locally-based print and online media, we face a number of challenges, including the risks that:
•The growing shift within the publishing industry from traditional print media to digital may compromise our ability to generate sufficient advertising revenues;
•Investments in growing our digital and marketing services and events business may not be successful, which could adversely affect our results of operations; and
•Our Advertising and marketing services revenues and Circulation revenues may further decline if we are unable to compete effectively with other companies in the local media industry.
For more information about the risks and challenges we face, see "Risk Factors" under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We believe the foundation of our business is the people and employees who make our day-to-day operations possible. A major focus in 2020 was our integration of Legacy Gannett onto a common infrastructure platform to manage all aspects of the employee experience including record keeping, communication and learning platforms, Employee Resource Group (“ERGs”) programs, benefits offerings and employment support services. This investment allowed for enhanced offerings in wellness, mental health benefits, safety and security guidance. These enhancements allowed us to deliver more consistent content and outreach to offer a social safety net to our employees as they navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest, and the U.S. political climate. 
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly prioritized the safety of our employees, while preserving our ability to produce vital news, by asking our employees to work remotely where possible and implementing new safety procedures for our manufacturing and distribution teams. By late March of 2020, we had transitioned 95% of our non-production and delivery employees to work remotely. For our production and delivery employees, we implemented social distancing measures and hygiene best practices in line with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization for all our facilities. These adjustments have allowed us to maintain our news delivery without any major disruptions to our communities. We continue to monitor the situation with respect to the pandemic and the health and safety of our employees continues to be of the utmost importance to us. 
Enabling a positive employee experience, within a values-based, inclusive work culture, is a top priority at Gannett. Aligned to our purpose, we provide engaging work and foster a culture that supports our employees’ ability to reach their goals and grow through learning and development. We cultivate a safe, diverse, inclusive, and equitable culture with broad promotion of ERGs. Two-way communication strategies include intersectional ERG events, monthly Town Hall meetings with our Chief Executive Officer and senior leadership, and our Together newsletter, which shares strategies on topics such as remote working, staying connected, and vaccination information and resources.

We are committed to building a workforce that reflects our communities and providing equal opportunities for each employee to thrive. We regularly track our progress and expect to share our workforce demographics publicly in the future. In addition, we are in the process of expanding our demographic data to help us better understand and serve our workforce, by providing employees the opportunity to voluntarily self-identify certain demographic information. We are confident that our efforts will help us reach our goal in being a workforce at parity with the diversity of our nation by 2025.
We listen through bi-annual Your Voice Engagement surveys, multiple Pulse surveys targeting current concerns, and Lifecycle surveys to understand the Gannett employee experience. The performance review process includes goal setting as well as regular manager feedback and coaching to assist with the career growth of our employees, and the use of development plans for individual career growth. Due to the 2020 pandemic, we postponed the formal portion of this process. In 2021, our full process is expected to resume with an annual review and quarterly check-ins. Our learning programs have been designed to successfully orient employees, build leadership capabilities and meet individual development needs. Through our centralized Learning Experience Platform, we deliver and manage both internally developed and customized programs such as our leadership development program, as well as partner programs. To further our employees experience we offer a volunteer time benefit and community giving campaigns and have added two additional holidays beginning in 2021: Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 18,100 employees in the U.S., of which approximately 15% are represented by labor unions, most of which are affiliated with one of seven international unions. Our employee base reflects our integration of Legacy Gannett to date, which has included consolidating production and distribution facilities, integrating and centralizing back office functions, centralizing and regionalizing our publishing sales, content, and circulation marketing organizations, and consolidating our marketing solutions organizations. It also reflects our alignment to business conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 2,700 employees outside of the U.S., including approximately 2,100 employed by Newsquest in the U.K. Our U.K. subsidiaries bargain with two unions over working practices, wages, and health and safety issues only. Most of our unionized employees work under collective bargaining agreements that are under negotiation or will expire in 2022, or are negotiating towards an initial collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 88 existing collective bargaining agreements and 8 bargaining units negotiating initial contracts. We believe relations with our employees are generally good, and we have had no work stoppages during 2020 at any of our publications.
