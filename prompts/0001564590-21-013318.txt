Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview and Highlights
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We market Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), which is approved in the U.S. for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Inbrija is for as needed use and utilizes our ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. We also market branded Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg.
Inbrija
 Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg (administered as two capsules), which may be taken up to five times per day. Inbrija became commercially available in the U.S. on February 28, 2019. Currently, Inbrija is available in the U.S. without the need for a medical exception for approximately 96% of commercial health insurance plan and approximately 25% of Medicare plan lives. Approximately one million people in the U.S. and 1.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s; it is estimated that approximately 40% of people with Parkinson’s in the U.S. experience OFF periods. Net revenue for Inbrija was $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We project peak U.S. annual net revenue of Inbrija to be in the range of $300 to $500 million.
 In September 2019, we announced that the European Commission, or EC, approved our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for Inbrija. The approved dose is 66 mg (administered as two capsules) up to five times per day (per European Union, or EU, convention, this reflects emitted dose and is equivalent to the 84 mg labelled dose in the U.S.). Under the MAA, Inbrija is indicated in the EU for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. Following the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, Acorda was granted a grandfathered Marketing Authorization (MA) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK which is subject to certain administrative filings that are due by December 31, 2021. We are in discussions with potential partners regarding the distribution of Inbrija outside of the U.S., with potential partners in Europe and Japan. 
 Ampyra
 Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time. Net revenue for Ampyra was $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 On October 30, 2020, we received a $15 million milestone payment from Biogen International GmbH under our license and collaboration with Biogen. Biogen markets Ampyra outside the U.S. as Fampyra. We became entitled to the milestone payment based on Biogen’s ex-U.S. net sales of Fampyra exceeding $100 million over the four consecutive quarters ending with the third quarter of 2020. This payment was recorded as milestone revenue in the third quarter. We retained approximately $14 million of the milestone payment net of our payment obligations to another party.
 Convertible Notes
 In December 2019, we announced the successful completion of a private exchange of $276 million of our convertible senior notes due in 2021 in exchange for a combination of approximately $207 million aggregate principal amount of newly-issued convertible senior secured notes due 2024 and $55.2 million in cash. The convertible senior secured notes due 2021 have an adjusted conversion price of approximately $21.00 per share. As a result of the exchange, approximately $69 million of convertible senior notes due in 2021, with an adjusted conversion price of approximately $255.35, remain outstanding.

Addressing the remaining portion of the convertible notes due 2021 is a top priority in addition to our focus on the Inbrija launch. More information about the terms and conditions of the 2021 and 2024 convertible notes is set forth in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report as well as in Financing Arrangements in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this report.
Sale of Chelsea, Massachusetts Manufacturing Operations
 In February 2021, we completed the sale of our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing operations to Catalent Pharma Solutions. Pursuant to the transaction, Catalent paid us $80 million in cash, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $74 million after transaction fees and expenses and settlement of customary post-closing adjustments. In connection with the sale of the manufacturing operations, we entered into a long-term, global manufacturing services agreement with a Catalent affiliate for the supply of Inbrija. As part of the transaction, Catalent hired substantially all of our prior employees at the Chelsea facility as well as certain of our other employees at our Waltham, Massachusetts facility. We intend to use the net proceeds received from the transaction for general corporate purposes, subject to compliance with the terms of the 2024 notes, which may include funding capital expenditures and the repayment of indebtedness. Also, we expect to save approximately $10 million in annual operating expenses related to the operation of the manufacturing facility. More information about the Catalent transaction is set forth below under Catalent Transaction. See Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information on the assets classified as held for sale as a result of the transaction.
Financial Management
 In January 2021, we announced a corporate restructuring to reduce costs and focus our resources on Inbrija, which is our key strategic priority for 2021. As part of the restructuring, we reduced headcount by approximately 16% through a reduction in force (excluding the employees that transferred to Catalent at the closing of the sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations). All of the reduction in personnel will take place in the first quarter of 2021. As a result, we expect to realize estimated annualized cost savings related to headcount reduction of approximately $6 million beginning in the second quarter of 2021. We estimate that we will incur approximately $3.2 million of pre-tax charges, substantially all of which will be cash expenditures, for severance and other employee separation-related costs in the first quarter of 2021.
 In January 2021, we entered into an At The Market (ATM) Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC as sales agent. Pursuant to the ATM agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to $15.25 million in an at-the-market offering, subject to a 3% sales commission payable to H.C. Wainwright. If we elect to use the ATM agreement, H.C. Wainwright would be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulations to sell shares in accordance with our instructions (including as to price, time or size limit or other parameters or conditions that we may impose). 
 On July 13, 2020, we received a U.S. income tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service of approximately $12.4 million plus interest of $0.3 million, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). Under the CARES Act, among other things, net operating losses arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, can be carried back to the preceding five years to apply against taxable income reported in such years. Pursuant to this provision of the CARES Act, the Company was eligible to carry back 2019 net operating losses to tax years 2017 and 2018, resulting in the refund.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash of approximately $102.9 million. Restricted cash includes $31.1 million in escrow related to the 6% semi-annual interest portion of the convertible senior secured notes due 2024, payable in cash or stock. As further described in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report as well as in Financing Arrangements in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this report, if we are permitted under the notes indenture and we elect to pay interest due in stock, the cash equivalent will be released from escrow. In December 2020, we issued 1,484,871 shares to the holders of the 2024 notes in satisfaction of approximately $6.2 million in interest due on December 1, 2020, and a corresponding amount was released from the escrow in late December 2020. 
 Nasdaq Listing Rules and Reverse Stock Split
 On January 19, 2021, we received a letter from The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC notifying us that we had regained compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), which requires that listed securities maintain a minimum closing bid price of at 
 2


least $1.00 per share (the “Minimum Bid Requirement”). We regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement based on the closing bid price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market between January 4, 2021 and January 15, 2021. We had previously been notified, on July 23, 2020, of our non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement.
 On December 31, 2020, we filed an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation which effected, as of 4:01 p.m. Eastern Time on December 31, 2020, a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of the shares of our outstanding common stock and proportionate reduction in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 370,000,000 to 61,666,666. Our Board of Directors approved the reverse stock split as part of plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. The reverse stock split had previously been authorized by our stockholders at a special meeting convened on July 31, 2020. 
 Our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Global Select Market commencing upon market open on January 4, 2021. The common stock continued to trade under the symbol “ACOR” after the reverse stock split became effective. The reverse stock split applied equally to all outstanding shares of the common stock and did not modify the rights or preferences of the common stock. The reverse stock split also resulted in a corresponding adjustment to outstanding equity awards as well as shares reserved for future issuance under our incentive compensation plans. 
 All figures in this report relating to shares of our common stock (such as share amounts, per share amounts, and conversion rates and prices), including in the financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements, have been retroactively restated to reflect the 1-for-6 reverse stock split of our common stock.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 Our business and financial condition have been impacted by, and are subject to risks resulting from, the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the healthcare industry. The duration of the pandemic is difficult to predict, and it is likely to have ongoing impacts as it continues. The travel restrictions, “shelter in place” orders, quarantine policies, and general concerns about the spread of COVID-19 have disrupted the delivery of healthcare to patients, for example making it more difficult for some patients to visit with their physician and obtain pharmaceutical prescriptions. Also, healthcare office staffing shortages may delay the administrative work, and particularly insurance-related documentation, needed to obtain reimbursement for prescriptions. We believe these factors contributed to volatility in new Inbrija prescriptions during 2020.
 The COVID-related policies, restrictions and concerns may disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. Also, our operations could be interrupted if we or our customers or suppliers lose the services of key employees or consultants who become ill from COVID-19. These types of disruptions could potentially affect any of our critical business functions, and thus harm our business, including for example our manufacturing, sales and marketing operations as well compliance and certain general and administrative functions. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. As the pandemic continues, it may result in a sustained economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and our ability to access capital on reasonable terms, or at all.
 Catalent Transaction
 In February 2021, we completed the sale of our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing operations to Catalent Pharma Solutions. Pursuant to the transaction, Catalent paid us $80 million in cash, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $74 million after transaction fees and expenses and settlement of customary post-closing adjustments. In connection with the sale of the manufacturing operations, we entered into a long-term, global manufacturing services agreement with a Catalent affiliate for the supply of Inbrija. As part of the transaction, Catalent hired substantially all of our prior employees at the Chelsea facility as well as certain of our other employees at our Waltham, Massachusetts facility. We intend to use the net proceeds received from the transaction for general corporate purposes, subject to compliance with the terms of the 2024 notes, which may include funding capital expenditures and the repayment of indebtedness. Also, we expect to save approximately $10 million in annual operating expenses related to the operation of the manufacturing facility.

Asset Purchase Agreement
 The Catalent transaction was completed pursuant to an asset purchase agreement that we entered into with Catalent in January 2021. Pursuant to the Catalent asset purchase agreement, upon completion of the sale of the manufacturing operations, Catalent assumed our existing lease to the Chelsea facility, acquired the manufacturing equipment and related manufacturing operations located at our Chelsea manufacturing facility, and acquired certain assets located at our Waltham, Massachusetts facility. Under the asset purchase agreement, both we and Catalent agreed to indemnify the other party for losses arising from certain breaches of the asset purchase agreement and other specified liabilities, subject to certain limitations. In connection with completion of the sale of the manufacturing operations, we and Catalent entered into certain additional ancillary agreements, including the Inbrija supply agreement, a transitional services agreement and certain other customary agreements.
Manufacturing Services Agreement
 The Catalent manufacturing services agreement provides that Catalent will manufacture Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), to our specifications, and we will purchase Inbrija exclusively from Catalent during the term of the manufacturing services agreement; provided that such exclusivity requirement will not apply to Inbrija intended for sale in China.
 The manufacturing services agreement, unless earlier terminated, will continue until December 31, 2030, and will be automatically extended for successive two-year periods unless either we or Catalent provides the other party with at least 18-months’ prior written notice of non-renewal. Either party may terminate the manufacturing services by written notice under certain circumstances, including material breach by the other party (subject to specified cure periods) or the insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the manufacturing services agreement upon certain specified regulatory events and for convenience upon 180 days’ prior written notice, subject to payment of a specified substantial termination fee.
 Under the manufacturing services agreement, we agreed to purchase from Catalent at least $16 million of Product in 2021 (pro-rated for a partial year) and $18 million of Product from 2022 through 2030 (and an additional amount in the last year in the case of such a proration), subject to reduction in certain cases. We will be obligated to provide Catalent with a rolling 24-month forecast of production requirements, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order by us. Catalent will be required to reserve sufficient capacity for the manufacture of a specified amount of Inbrija per year, with such capacity reservation to be reviewed on an annual basis.
 In addition, the manufacturing services agreement grants to Catalent a non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferrable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to certain of our intellectual property in order to enable the manufacture of Inbrija. Catalent has granted to us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, assignable and sublicensable license to certain of its intellectual property as reasonably necessary to allow us to commercialize Inbrija.
 The manufacturing services agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property created pursuant to the manufacturing services agreement, as well as provisions relating to ordering, payment and shipping terms, regulatory matters, reporting obligations, indemnity, confidentiality and other matters.
 Our Strategy
 Our long-term strategy is to grow as a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company and to become a leading neurology company dedicated to the identification, development and commercialization of therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. For 2021, our strategic priorities include:

* In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive royalties on Fampyra payable to us by Biogen, up to an agreed-upon threshold of royalties. Until this threshold is met, if ever, we will not receive Fampyra royalty revenue although we have retained the right to receive any potential future milestone payments from Biogen.
 
** In November 2017, we announced a royalty monetization with Lundbeck pursuant to which our Biotie subsidiary received a $13 million payment from Lundbeck in exchange for an amendment to its Selincro license eliminating Lundbeck’s future royalty and milestone obligations on sales of Selincro outside of the U.S. Selincro is not approved for use in the U.S. and is not under development for use in the U.S.
 Background on Neurological Conditions 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. Where our neurology programs may also show promise for disorders outside of the nervous system, we may elect to pursue these opportunistically as well. We are focused on developing and marketing therapeutics targeted to the conditions described below, although we have deferred investment in our research and development programs pending additional progress with the Inbrija commercial launch in the U.S. We believe there is significant unmet medical need for these conditions, which can severely impact the lives of those who suffer from them.
Parkinson’s Disease
 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain. These neurons are responsible for producing dopamine and that loss causes a range of symptoms including impaired movement, muscle stiffness and tremors. Approximately one million Americans and 1.2 million Europeans suffer from Parkinson’s. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment currently available for Parkinson’s disease. Current treatment strategies are focused on the management and reduction of the major symptoms of the disease and related disabilities. These 
 5


therapies either aim to supplement dopamine levels in the brain, mimic the effect of dopamine in the brain by stimulating dopamine receptors or prevent the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is oral carbidopa/levodopa. Approximately 70% of people with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. are treated with oral carbidopa/levodopa. Effective control of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is referred to as an ON state.
 As Parkinson’s disease progresses, people are likely to experience OFF periods, also known as OFF episodes, which are characterized by the return of Parkinson’s symptoms, which can occur despite underlying baseline therapy. Even optimized regimens of oral carbidopa/levodopa are associated with increasingly wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption into the bloodstream. This results in the unreliable control of symptoms, leading to motor complications including OFF periods. OFF periods can increase in frequency and severity during the course of the disease, and remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies. About half of people with Parkinson’s disease treated with levodopa therapy experience OFF periods within five years of initiating treatment. For the approximately 350,000 people in the U.S. and 420,000 in Europe who experience them, OFF periods are inadequately addressed by available therapies and are considered one of the greatest unmet medical needs facing people with Parkinson’s disease. OFF periods can be very disruptive to the lives of people with Parkinson’s disease, their families and caregivers. In a survey of 3,000 people with Parkinson’s conducted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, 64% of respondents reporting having at least two hours of OFF time per day.
 Multiple Sclerosis 
 Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic, usually progressive disease in which the immune system attacks and degrades the function of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. These nerve fibers consist of long, thin fibers, or axons, surrounded by a myelin sheath, which facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses, much as insulation facilitates conduction in an electrical wire. In MS, the myelin sheath is damaged by the body's own immune system, causing areas of myelin sheath loss, also known as demyelination. This damage, which can occur at multiple sites in the central nervous system, blocks or diminishes conduction of electrical impulses. Patients with MS may suffer impairments in a wide range of neurological functions. These impairments vary from individual to individual and over the course of time, depending on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and often include difficulty walking. Individuals vary in the severity of the impairments they suffer on a day-to-day basis, with impairments becoming better or worse depending on the activity of the disease on a given day.
 Approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) is the first and only inhaled levodopa, or L-dopa, for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson’s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg (administered as two capsules), which may be taken up to five times per day. Inbrija became commercially available in the U.S. on February 28, 2019. Currently, Inbrija is available in the U.S. without the need for a medical exception for approximately 96% of commercial health insurance plan and approximately 25% of Medicare plan lives. Net revenue for Inbrija was $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We project peak U.S. annual net revenue of Inbrija to be in the range of $300 to $500 million.
 In September 2019, we announced that the European Commission, or EC, approved our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for Inbrija. The approved dose is 66 mg (administered as two capsules) up to five times per day (per European Union, or EU, convention, this reflects emitted dose and is equivalent to the 84 mg labelled dose in the U.S.). Under the MAA, Inbrija is indicated in the EU for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. The MAA approved Inbrija for use in what were then the 27 countries of the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Following the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, Acorda was granted a grandfathered Marketing Authorization (MA) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK which is subject to certain administrative filings that are due by December

31, 2021. We are in discussions with potential partners regarding the distribution of Inbrija outside of the U.S., with potential partners in Europe and Japan. 
 Inbrija is marketed in the U.S. through our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure, which we are supplementing with sales representatives provided by a contract commercial organization. Inbrija is distributed in the U.S. primarily through: Alliance Rx Walgreens Prime, or Walgreens, a specialty pharmacy that delivers the medication to patients by mail; and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (an AmeriSource Bergen affiliate). During 2020, we transitioned from a network of several specialty pharmacies to Walgreens as the sole specialty pharmacy for U.S. sales of Inbrija, which we believe has potential benefits to patients and our business. Our neuro-specialty sales and marketing team includes our own sales representatives as well as established teams of Medical Science Liaisons, Regional Reimbursement Directors, and Market Access Account Directors who provide information to payers and physicians on our marketed products; and Market Development Managers who work collaboratively with field teams and corporate personnel to assist in the execution of the Company’s strategic initiatives. Our sales representatives (with the contracted representatives) are targeting approximately 5,000 healthcare providers, currently focusing on a priority list of approximately 2,000 physicians who are high volume prescribers of levodopa/carbidopa. Our Inbrija launch activities are focused on physician awareness and market access as well as patient awareness, education and training.
 We have established Prescription Support Services for Inbrija, which we sometimes refer to as the Inbrija hub. Prescription Support Services is designed to help patients navigate their insurance coverage and offer reimbursement support services, when appropriate. Services fall into one of these categories: insurance verification, to research patient insurance benefits and confirm insurance coverage; prior authorization support, to identify prior authorization requirements; and appeals support. For patients that may need assistance paying for their medication, Prescription Support Services offers several support options, including: a program that provides no cost medication to patients who meet specific program eligibility requirements; co-pay support, which may help commercially insured (non-government funded) patients lower their out-of-pocket costs; and a bridge program, for federally-insured patients who experience a delay in coverage determination. We have implemented a no-cost sample program, available at physician offices, to enable patients and their physicians to assess the value of Inbrija before the patient incurs out-of-pocket co-pay or co-insurance costs. In addition, we have implemented a free trial program, available through the Inbrija hub, for commercially insured patients who cannot access the free samples because of offices and institutions that have policies that prohibit samples.
 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain. These neurons are responsible for producing dopamine and that loss causes a range of symptoms including impaired movement, muscle stiffness and tremors. The standard baseline treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects. As Parkinson’s progresses, people are likely to experience OFF periods, which are characterized by the return of Parkinson’s symptoms that result from low levels of dopamine between doses of oral carbidopa/levodopa. OFF periods are often highly disruptive to people with Parkinson’s. Approximately one million people in the U.S. and 1.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s; it is estimated that approximately 40% of people with Parkinson’s in the U.S. experience OFF periods.
 Inbrija is for as needed use and utilizes our ARCUS platform for inhaled therapeutics. ARCUS is a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. The ARCUS platform allows systemic delivery of medication through inhalation, by transforming molecules into a light, porous dry powder. This allows delivery of substantially higher doses of medication than can be delivered via conventional dry powder technologies. We acquired the ARCUS technology platform as part of our 2014 acquisition of Civitas Therapeutics. We have worldwide rights to our ARCUS drug delivery technology, which is protected by extensive know-how and trade secrets and various U.S. and foreign patents, including patents that protect the Inbrija dry powder capsules beyond 2030. We have several patents listed in the Orange Book for Inbrija, including patents expiring between 2022 and 2032, and Inbrija is entitled to three years of new product exclusivity, through December 2021, as posted in the Orange book.
 Clinical Studies and Safety Profile
 FDA and European Commission approvals of Inbrija were based on a clinical program that included approximately 900 people with Parkinson’s on a carbidopa/levodopa regimen experiencing OFF periods. The Phase 3 pivotal trial for Inbrija – SPAN-PD – was a 12-week, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study evaluating the effectiveness of Inbrija in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s experiencing OFF periods. In January 2019, we announced that The Lancet Neurology published results from the SPAN-PD clinical trial.

The SPAN-PD trial met its primary endpoint, with patients showing a statistically significant improvement in motor function at the week 12 visit, as measured by a reduction in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III score for Inbrija 84 mg (n=114) compared to placebo (n=112) at 30 minutes post-dose (-9.83 points and -5.91 points respectively; p=0.009). Onset of action was seen as early as 10 minutes. Maintenance of effect continued to 60 minutes post-dose, which is the longest time point assessed in the trial. UPDRS III is a validated scale, which measures Parkinson’s disease motor impairment.
 The most common adverse reactions with Inbrija (at least 5% and greater than placebo) in the pivotal trial were cough (15% vs. 2%), upper respiratory tract infection (6% vs. 3%), nausea (5% vs. 3%) and discolored sputum (5% vs. 0%).
 Inbrija was also studied in a Phase 3 long-term, active-controlled, randomized, open-label study (N=398) assessing safety and tolerability over one year. This study showed the average reduction in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) from baseline was the same (-0.1 L) for the Inbrija and observational cohorts. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or other chronic respiratory disease within the last five years were excluded from this study.
 Inbrija is not to be used by patients who take or have taken a nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor such as phenelzine or tranylcypromine within the last two weeks.
 Additional Important Safety Information
 Before using Inbrija, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all their medical conditions, including:
  
• | asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or any chronic lung disease
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | daytime sleepiness from a sleep disorder or if they get drowsy/sleepy without warning or take a medicine that increases sleepiness such as sleep medicines, antidepressants, or antipsychotics
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | feel dizzy, nausea, sweaty, or faint when standing from sitting/lying down
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | history of abnormal movement (dyskinesia)
--+------------------------------------------


• | mental health problem such as hallucinations or psychosis
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | uncontrollable urges (for example, gambling, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, or binge eating)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | glaucoma
--+---------


• | pregnancy or plans to become pregnant. It is not known if Inbrija will harm an unborn baby.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | breastfeeding or plans to breastfeed. Levodopa (the medicine in Inbrija) can pass into breastmilk and it is unknown if it can harm the baby.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Patients should tell their healthcare provider if they take:
  
• | MAO-B inhibitors
--+-----------------


• | dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (including phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, metoclopramide), or isoniazid
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | iron salts or multivitamins that contain iron salts
--+----------------------------------------------------

 No more than 1 dose (2 capsules) should be taken for any OFF period. No more than 5 doses (10 capsules) of Inbrija should be taken in a day.

Inbrija is for oral inhalation only. Inbrija capsules are not to be swallowed or opened.
 Patients are not to drive, operate machinery, or do other activities until they know how Inbrija affects them. Sleepiness and falling asleep suddenly can happen as late as a year after treatment is started.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) can cause serious side effects including the following. Patients should tell their healthcare provider if they experience them:
  
• | falling asleep during normal daily activities (such as driving, doing physical tasks, using hazardous machinery, talking, or eating) and can be without warning. If patients become drowsy while using Inbrija, they should not drive or do activities where they need to be alert. Chances of falling asleep during normal activities increases if patients take medicines that cause sleepiness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion (symptoms including fever, confusion, stiff muscles, and changes in breathing and heartbeat) in patients who suddenly lower or change their dose or stop using Inbrija or carbidopa/levodopa medicines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | low blood pressure with or without dizziness, fainting, nausea, and sweating. Patients should get up slowly after sitting or lying down.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hallucinations and other psychosis – Inbrija may cause or worsen psychotic symptoms including hallucinations (seeing/hearing things that are not real); confusion, disorientation, or disorganized thinking; trouble sleeping; dreaming a lot; being overly suspicious or feeling people want to harm them; believing things that are not real, acting aggressive, and feeling agitated/restless.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unusual uncontrollable urges such as gambling, binge eating, shopping, and sexual urges has occurred in some people using medicines like Inbrija.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | uncontrolled, sudden body movements (dyskinesia) may be caused or worsened by Inbrija. Inbrija may need to be stopped or other Parkinson’s medicines may need to be changed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bronchospasm – people with asthma, COPD, or other lung diseases may wheeze or have difficulty breathing after inhaling Inbrija. If patients have these symptoms, they should stop taking Inbrija and call their healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased eye pressure in patients with glaucoma. Healthcare providers should monitor this.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in certain lab values including liver tests.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 The most common side effects of Inbrija include cough, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, and change in the color of saliva or spit.
 It is not known if Inbrija is safe or effective in children.
 Ampyra
 Ampyra (dalfampridine) is an oral drug approved by the FDA in January 2010 as a treatment to improve walking in adults with multiple sclerosis. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Ampyra demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of multiple sclerosis (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive). Ampyra can be used alone or with concurrent medications, including immunomodulatory drugs. The majority of patients in our two Phase 3 clinical trials for Ampyra (63%) were taking immunomodulatory drugs (interferons, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab). Ampyra is an extended release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), which had previously been referred to as fampridine. Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker. In animal studies, dalfampridine has been shown to increase conduction of nerve signals in demyelinated axons through blocking of potassium channels. The mechanism by which dalfampridine exerts its therapeutic effect has not been fully elucidated.

Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time. Net revenue for Ampyra was $98.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 License and Collaboration Agreement with Biogen
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen International GmbH, or Biogen, under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in June 2009. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Under our agreement with Biogen, we are entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of Fampyra and we are also entitled to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones. In October 2020, we received a $15 million milestone payment from Biogen based on ex-U.S. net sales exceeding $100 million over the four consecutive quarters ending with the third quarter of 2020. This payment was recorded as milestone revenue in the third quarter. We retained approximately $14 million of the milestone payment net of our payment obligations to another party. In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive these Fampyra royalties up to an agreed-upon threshold. Until this threshold is met, if ever, we will not receive Fampyra royalties although we retained the right to receive any potential future milestone payments, including the milestone payment described above. The HCRP transaction is accounted for as a liability, as described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Ampyra Patent Update
 There are no patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra. Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents.
 There are two European patents, EP 1732548 and EP 2377536, with claims directed to use of a sustained release dalfampridine composition (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union) to increase walking speed in a patient with multiple sclerosis. Both European patents are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Nullity actions have been filed in Germany against both of the German national patents derived from EP 1732548 and EP 2377536 by ratiopharm GmbH, a generic manufacturer affiliated with Teva. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021.
 We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
 Clinical Studies and Safety Profile
 Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Ampyra was based on data from a comprehensive development program assessing the safety and efficacy of Ampyra, including two Phase 3 trials that involved 540 people with MS. The primary measure of efficacy in our two Phase 3 MS trials was walking speed (in feet per second) as measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), using a responder analysis. A responder was defined as a patient who showed faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double-blind period than the maximum speed achieved in the five non-double-blind, no treatment visits (four before the double-blind period and one after). A significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily were responders compared to patients taking placebo, as measured by the T25FW (Trial 1: 34.8% vs. 8.3%; Trial 2: 42.9% vs. 9.3%). The increased response rate in the Ampyra group was observed across all four major types of MS. During the double-blind treatment period, a significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily had increases in walking speed of at least 10%, 20%, or 30% from baseline, compared to placebo. In both trials, the consistent improvements in walking speed were shown to be associated with improvements on a patient self-assessment of ambulatory disability, the 12 item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), for both drug and placebo treated patients. However, a drug vs. placebo difference was not established for that outcome measure.
 In October 2015, we presented 5-year post-marketing safety data for dalfampridine extended release tablets in MS at the 31st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. 
 10


The data presented continue to be consistent with those reported in double-blind clinical trials, with incidence of reported seizure remaining stable over time.
 The FDA’s approval letter included certain post-marketing study requirements and confirmed certain commitments made by us with respect to Ampyra, all of which we have now completed. The post-marketing requirements included additional animal toxicology studies to evaluate certain impurities, in-vitro receptor binding and abuse potential studies in animals, and an evaluation of clinical adverse events related to abuse potential. We completed these studies and timely submitted the results to the FDA. Also, we committed to the FDA that we would conduct a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate a 5 mg twice-daily dosing regimen of Ampyra, as well as a pharmacokinetic evaluation of a 7.5 mg dosage strength in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. We also committed to report all post-marketing seizure events on an expedited basis to the FDA. We completed the renal impairment study and timely submitted the results to the FDA, but the FDA may require additional studies. In August 2012, we announced results of the 5mg efficacy study. The study failed to confirm efficacy of the 5mg dose. We believe that this study, together with Ampyra registration studies, continue to show that 10mg twice daily is the appropriate, safe, and effective dose. The study results were provided to the FDA, which subsequently confirmed that we have satisfied this post-marketing requirement.
 In our two Phase 3 clinical studies of Ampyra in spinal cord injury, which were completed in 2004, the results did not reach statistical significance on their primary endpoints.
 ARCUS Product Development
 We have been exploring opportunities for other proprietary products in which inhaled delivery of medicine using our ARCUS drug delivery technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients. We believe there are potential opportunities with central nervous system, or CNS, as well as non-CNS, disorders.
 Our ARCUS development has been focused on a program for acute treatment of migraine. Existing oral therapies for migraine can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. We have been evaluating therapeutic candidates for their suitability to move forward with this program. Due to our three restructurings since 2017 and associated cost-cutting measures, we have deferred consideration of further investment into potential new ARCUS applications in migraine pending additional progress with the Inbrija commercial launch in the U.S.
 Should we decide in the future to make investments in any ARCUS development program, we would be reliant on Catalent Pharma Solutions for the manufacture of product for that program. Our global supply agreement with Catalent does not provide for the terms and conditions under which Catalent would supply any product or product candidate other than Inbrija. We would be unable to advance the development of any ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidate unless Catalent is willing to manufacture the candidate for us on commercially reasonable terms. Also, due to reductions in force, employee attrition and the 2021 sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations, we believe we lack certain personnel needed for, and would need to hire replacements before continuing with, this research and development work.
 In July 2015, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a grant to support the development of a formulation and delivery system for a dry powder version of lung surfactant, a treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, or nRDS. In collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we developed a formulation and delivery device based on our proprietary ARCUS drug delivery technology. nRDS is a condition affecting prematurely born infants in which their lungs are underdeveloped and thus lack a sufficient amount of lung surfactant. It can be fatal, or lead to severe, chronic health issues caused by a lack of oxygen getting to the baby’s brain and other organs. Delivering liquid surfactant to the lungs via intubation is the standard of care. We believe that our formulation and delivery system may present a more practical alternative for use in developing areas of the world, where intubation poses numerous problems. Based on achievement of pre-clinical proof of concept, the foundation expanded the funding to include pre-IND development, including an additional grant of approximately $2.08 million in 2020 to continue this work. This program is not aimed at developing a commercial product, but our work on this program could potentially generate information that is useful for adapting the ARCUS drug delivery technology to commercial pediatric uses. We expect all current grant-funded work to be completed in the first half of 2021. We are evaluating next steps for our continuing involvement in this program as it transitions past the grant-funding stage and in light of the sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations and other factors.

Other Research and Development Programs
 Our other research and development programs include rHIgM22 and cimaglermin alfa. rHIgM22 is a remyelinating antibody that is a potential therapeutic for multiple sclerosis. Data from a Phase 1 safety and tolerability trial showed that a single dose of rHIgM22 was not associated with any safety signals. The study was not powered to show efficacy and exploratory measures showed no difference between the treatment groups. Cimaglermin alfa is a member of the neuregulin growth factor family, and has been shown to promote recovery after neurological injury, as well as enhance heart function in animal models of heart failure. We initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial assessing three doses of cimaglermin alfa in people with heart failure, but discontinued enrollment and then received an FDA clinical hold based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury). The FDA clinical hold was lifted after we presented additional data on the hepatotoxicity, but we have not since restarted any clinical study of cimaglermin alfa. We are considering next steps for these programs, which could include potential partnering or out-licensing, but due to our three restructurings since 2017 and associated cost-cutting measures, we have deferred consideration of any further investment pending additional progress with the Inbrija commercial launch in the U.S.
Sales, Marketing and Market Access
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)
 Inbrija is marketed in the U.S. through our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure, which we are supplementing with sales representatives provided by a contract commercial organization. Inbrija is distributed in the U.S. primarily through:  Alliance Rx Walgreens Prime, or Walgreens, a specialty pharmacy that delivers the medication to patients by mail; and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (an AmeriSource Bergen affiliate). During 2020, we transitioned from a network of several specialty pharmacies to Walgreens as the sole specialty pharmacy for U.S. sales of Inbrija, which we believe has potential benefits to patients and our business. Our neuro-specialty sales and marketing team includes our own sales representatives as well as established teams of Medical Science Liaisons, Regional Reimbursement Directors, and Market Access Account Directors who provide information to payers and physicians on our marketed products; and Market Development Managers who work collaboratively with field teams and corporate personnel to assist in the execution of the Company’s strategic initiatives. Our sales representatives (with the contracted representatives) are targeting approximately 5,000 healthcare providers, currently focusing on a priority list of approximately 2,000 physicians who are high volume prescribers of levodopa/carbidopa. Our Inbrija launch activities are focused on physician awareness and market access as well as patient awareness, education and training.
 We have established Prescription Support Services for Inbrija, which we sometimes refer to as the Inbrija hub. Prescription Support Services is designed to help patients navigate their insurance coverage and offer reimbursement support services, when appropriate. Services fall into one of these categories: insurance verification, to research patient insurance benefits and confirm insurance coverage; prior authorization support, to identify prior authorization requirements; and appeals support. For patients that may need assistance paying for their medication, Prescription Support Services offers several support options, including: a program that provides no cost medication to patients who meet specific program eligibility requirements; co-pay support, which may help commercially insured (non-government funded) patients lower their out-of-pocket costs; and a bridge program, for federally-insured patients who experience a delay in coverage determination. We have implemented a no-cost sample program, available at physician offices, to enable patients and their physicians to assess the value of Inbrija before the patient incurs out-of-pocket co-pay or co-insurance costs. In addition, we have implemented a free trial program, available through the Inbrija hub, for commercially insured patients who cannot access the free samples because of offices and institutions that have policies that prohibit samples.
 Ampyra
 Ampyra is marketed in the U.S. through our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure, which we are supplementing with sales representatives provided by a contract commercial organization, and is distributed in the U.S. primarily through a network of specialty pharmacies, which deliver the medication to patients by mail. We have contracted with a third party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run Ampyra Patient Support Services, or APSS, a dedicated resource that coordinates the prescription process among healthcare providers, people with multiple sclerosis, and insurance carriers. We have a 60-day free trial program that provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost. We are evaluating the level of our continuing investment in certain Ampyra sales and marketing programs, including our free trial program and APSS, due to the introduction of generic competition and corresponding decline in Ampyra sales.

Material and Other Collaborations and License Agreements
 Alkermes (ARCUS products)
 On December 27, 2010, Civitas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Alkermes, Inc. pursuant to which Alkermes assigned, sold and transferred to Civitas certain of its rights in certain pulmonary delivery patents and patents applications, certain equipment and instruments relating to pulmonary drug delivery, copies of certain documents and reports relating to pulmonary delivery, certain pulmonary drug delivery inhalers and certain pulmonary drug delivery Investigational New Drug Applications, or INDs, filed with the FDA. Alkermes also granted to Civitas a non-exclusive sublicense to know-how for the purpose of development and commercialization of ARCUS products. Civitas is permitted to license and sublicense the pulmonary patents, patent applications and know-how, subject to certain restrictions, as necessary for our business. Without the prior written consent of Alkermes, Civitas is prohibited from assigning the intellectual property acquired from Alkermes, except to an affiliate or to a person that acquires all or substantially all of its business to which the agreement relates, whether by acquisition, sale, merger or otherwise.
 Civitas is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ARCUS products. Civitas is obligated to pay to Alkermes royalties for each licensed product. For licensed products sold by Civitas or an affiliate, Civitas will pay Alkermes a mid-single digit percentage royalty on net sales. For licensed products sold by a collaboration partner, Civitas will pay Alkermes the lower of either (1) a mid-single digit percentage royalty on collaboration partner net sales of licensed products in any given calendar year, or (2) a percentage in the low-to-mid-double digits of all collaboration partner revenue received in such calendar year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the collaboration partner royalty paid be less than a low-single digit percentage of collaboration partner net sales of the licensed product in any given calendar year. 
 Civitas has the right to terminate the Alkermes agreement at any time upon giving 90 days’ written notice. The Alkermes agreement may also be terminated by either party with respect to certain specified uncured breaches following notice and the expiration of a cure period.
 Subject to the termination provisions described above, the Alkermes agreement remains in effect until expiration of Civitas’ royalty obligations to Alkermes. Royalties are payable to Alkermes on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the patents acquired from Alkermes containing a valid claim covering a product in a particular country and (ii) 12 years and six months after the launch of a product in a country.
 Biogen (Fampyra)
 In 2009, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which we and Biogen have agreed to collaborate on the development and commercialization of products containing aminopyridines, including Ampyra, initially directed to the treatment of multiple sclerosis, or MS, (licensed products). Under the Collaboration Agreement, Ampyra is marketed by Biogen as Fampyra outside the U.S. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. 
 The Collaboration Agreement includes a sublicense of our rights under an existing license agreement with Alkermes (formerly Elan). We have also entered into a related Supply Agreement pursuant to which we supply Biogen with its requirements for the licensed products through our existing supply agreement with Alkermes. Biogen Inc., the parent of Biogen, has guaranteed the performance of Biogen's obligations under the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen, itself or through its affiliates, has the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the U.S., unless rights to a particular country terminate under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, while we retain the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in the U.S. Each party has the exclusive right to develop licensed products for its commercialization territory, although the parties may also decide to jointly carry out mutually agreed future development activities under a cost-sharing arrangement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we participate in overseeing the development and commercialization of Ampyra and other licensed products in markets outside the U.S. in part through our participation in joint committees with Biogen. If Biogen does not participate in the development of licensed products for certain indications or forms of administration, it may lose the right to develop and commercialize the licensed products for such indication or form of administration. Biogen may sublicense its rights to certain unaffiliated distributors. During the term of the Collaboration Agreement and for two years after the Collaboration Agreement terminates, neither party nor its affiliates may, other than pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, research, 
 13


develop, manufacture or commercialize any competing product, defined as one that contains aminopyridine or any other compound that acts at least in part through direct interaction with potassium channels to improve neurological function in MS, spinal cord injury or other demyelinating conditions, except that we may exploit the licensed products anywhere in the world following termination of the Collaboration Agreement.
 In consideration for the rights granted to Biogen under the Collaboration Agreement, we were entitled to a non-refundable upfront payment of $110.0 million as of June 30, 2009, which was received in July 2009. Also, in August 2011, we received a $25 million milestone payment from Biogen for approval of Fampyra in the EU. Under our separate license and supply agreements with Alkermes, in 2009 we paid Alkermes $7.7 million of the $110 million upfront Biogen payment and in 2011 we paid Alkermes $1.8 million of the $25 million Biogen milestone payment. We are entitled to receive additional payments from Biogen of up to $10 million based on the successful achievement of future regulatory milestones and up to $340 million based on the successful achievement of future sales milestones. On October 30, 2020, we received a $15 million milestone payment from Biogen based on Biogen’s ex-U.S. net sales of Fampyra exceeding $100 million over the four consecutive quarters ending with the third quarter of 2020. This payment was recorded as milestone revenue in the third quarter. We retained approximately $14 million of the milestone payment net of our payment obligations to another party.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are also entitled to receive double-digit percentage tiered royalties on net sales of licensed products by Biogen, its affiliates or certain distributors outside of the U.S. Such royalties for products combining a licensed compound with at least one other clinically active therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic ingredient are determined based on the contribution of the licensed compound to the overall sales or value of the combination product. Biogen may offset against the royalties payable to us a portion of certain royalties that it may need to pay to third parties. In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive these Fampyra royalties up to an agreed-upon threshold. Until this threshold is met, if ever, we will not receive Fampyra royalties although we have retained the right to receive any potential future milestone payments, described above.
 Biogen exclusively purchases all of Biogen's, its affiliates' and its sublicensees' requirements of the licensed products from us. The purchase price paid by Biogen for licensed products under the Collaboration Agreement and Supply Agreement reflects the prices owed to our suppliers under our supply arrangements with Alkermes or other suppliers. In addition, Biogen pays us, in consideration for its purchase and sale of the licensed products, any amounts due to Alkermes for ex-U.S. sales, including royalties owed under the terms of our existing agreements with Alkermes.
 The Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of Biogen's royalty payment obligations, which occurs, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, upon the latest of expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product, fifteen years following first commercial sale of such licensed product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity and the existence of certain levels of sales by competing products. The Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement will automatically terminate upon the termination of our license agreement with Alkermes in its entirety or with respect to all countries outside of the U.S. We cannot terminate our license agreement with Alkermes without Biogen's prior written consent under certain circumstances. Biogen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis at any time upon 180 days' prior written notice, subject to our right to accelerate such termination. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the agreement, which termination will be limited to a particular country or region under certain circumstances. However, if Biogen has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement due to our material uncured breach, Biogen may instead elect to keep the agreement in effect, but decrease the royalty rates they pay us by a specified percentage. We may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement if Biogen does not commercially launch a licensed product within a specified time period after receiving regulatory approval for such licensed product or otherwise fails to meet certain commercialization obligations. In addition, we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement under certain circumstances if (i) Biogen, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenge certain of our patents or (ii) there is a change in control of Biogen or its parent company or certain dispositions of assets by Biogen, its parent or its affiliated companies, followed by a change in the sales and marketing personnel responsible for the licensed products in Biogen's territory of more than a specified percentage within a certain period of time after such change in control or disposition. The Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the Supply Agreement. In addition, the Supply Agreement will terminate automatically upon termination of the Collaboration Agreement, and the Collaboration Agreement will terminate automatically if the Supply Agreement is terminated for any reason other than for a material breach that we are responsible for. To the extent permitted by law, each party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement if the other party is subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
 14


If the Supply Agreement is terminated by Biogen for an uncured material breach, we will waive our right for Alkermes to exclusively supply the licensed products to us solely to permit Biogen to negotiate terms with Alkermes for the supply of licensed products to Biogen. If the Supply Agreement is otherwise terminated, Biogen will not have any future obligations to purchase licensed products from us and we will not have any future obligations to supply Biogen with licensed products. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated, Biogen will assign to us all regulatory documentation and other information necessary or useful to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries and will grant us a license under Biogen's and its affiliates' relevant patent rights, know-how and trademarks to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries. Such assignment and license will be at no cost to us unless the Collaboration Agreement is terminated by Biogen for a material uncured breach that we are responsible for, in which case the parties will negotiate a payment to Biogen to reflect the net value of such assigned and licensed rights.
 Neither party may assign the agreements without the prior written consent of the other, except to an affiliate or, in certain cases, to a third party acquirer of the party.
 In connection with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen and Alkermes entered into a Consent Agreement with us. Under the Consent Agreement, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of rights to Biogen, and the three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under our agreements with Alkermes with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors; permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities; and, requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances.
 Alkermes (Ampyra)
 We have entered into agreements with Elan Corporation plc, including those described immediately below and elsewhere in this report. In September 2011, Alkermes plc acquired Elan’s Drug Technologies business and Elan transferred our agreements to Alkermes as part of that transaction. Throughout this report, references to “Alkermes” include Alkermes plc and also, as the context may require, Elan Corporation plc as the predecessor to Alkermes plc under our agreements.
 In September 2003, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Elan that replaced two prior license agreements for Ampyra in oral sustained release dosage form. Under this agreement, Elan granted us exclusive worldwide rights to Ampyra for all indications, including spinal cord injury, or SCI, multiple sclerosis, or MS, and all other indications. We agreed to pay Elan milestone payments of up to $15.0 million, of which we have reached and paid $5.0 million, and royalties based on net sales of products with dalfampridine as the active ingredient. We also agreed to pay Elan 7% of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to Ampyra or other aminopyridine products. As a result of our Collaboration Agreement with Biogen, described above, in 2009 we paid Elan $7.7 million of a $110 million upfront payment we received from Biogen, and in 2011 we paid Elan $1.8 million of a $25 million milestone payment we received from Biogen.
 Alkermes (now the licensor under this agreement due to its 2011 acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business) is also obligated under this agreement to supply us with our commercial requirements for Ampyra in the U.S., as well as to supply Biogen under the Supply Agreement and Consent Agreement with Fampyra for Biogen’s clinical trials and for Biogen’s commercial requirements.
 Alkermes may terminate our license in countries in which we have a license, if we fail to file for regulatory approvals within a commercially reasonable time after completion and receipt of positive data from all preclinical and clinical studies required for the related New Drug Application, or NDA, equivalent. We could also lose our rights under the license agreement if we fail to launch a product in such countries within 180 days of NDA or equivalent approval and receipt of other needed regulatory approvals, or if we fail to fulfill our payment obligations under the license agreement. If Alkermes terminates our license in any applicable country, Alkermes is entitled to license from us our patent rights and know-how relating to the product and to market the product in the applicable country, subject to royalty payments to us.
 15


We have the right to terminate the Alkermes license at any time upon 90 days’ written notice. In addition, the Alkermes license may be immediately terminated by either party following an incurable breach of any term or provision by the other party. The Alkermes license may also be terminated by either party following notice and the expiration of a cure period with respect to an uncured breach by either party.
 Subject to the termination provisions described above, the Alkermes license terminates on a country-by-country basis on the last to occur of fifteen years from the date of the agreement (2018), the expiration of the last to expire Alkermes patent or the existence of a threshold level of competition in that country.
 Other License Agreements
 In addition to the material license and collaboration agreements described above, we have entered into numerous other license agreements to support our research and development programs. These other license agreements include the following:

• | We have an exclusive, worldwide license from the Mayo Foundation for Education and Research, or Mayo Clinic, to specified patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property on certain antibodies relating to our research on the therapeutic use of these antibodies, specifically myelination and remyelination in multiple sclerosis, or MS, and spinal cord injury.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc) to certain patents, patent applications and know-how relating to cimaglermin alfa or fragments thereof and non-protein products developed through the use of material covered by a valid claim in the patents. The license to these patents and the right to sublicense these patents were granted to Paion by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.

Manufacturing and Supply
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)
 Chelsea Manufacturing Facility
 All commercial supply of Inbrija is currently manufactured at Catalent’s Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility, which was transferred to Catalent in February 2021 in connection with our sale to Catalent of our Chelsea manufacturing operations. In connection with the sale, we entered into a long-term, global manufacturing services (supply) agreement with a Catalent affiliate pursuant to which they have agreed to manufacture Inbrija for us at the Chelsea facility. Under the supply agreement, which is further described below under Catalent Manufacturing Services Agreement, Catalent is our exclusive Inbrija supplier other than for sale in China.
 Catalent may need expanded manufacturing capacity at the Chelsea facility to meet demand depending on the timing and extent of sales growth. In 2018, prior to the sale of the Chelsea manufacturing operations, we initiated a renovation and expansion of the Chelsea facility that increased the size of the facility from approximately 90,000 to approximately 95,000 square feet. The project added a new manufacturing production line for Inbrija that has greater capacity than the existing manufacturing line, and it has created additional warehousing space for manufactured product. Although the project was substantially completed in late 2019, the expansion does not yet have all of the approvals needed for use of the new production line for commercial manufacture, such as approvals from the FDA, Massachusetts state environmental permits, and approvals from other regulatory authorities. Also, manufacturing scale-up generally is subject to significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields, which is especially true for the manufacture of a product such as Inbrija which involves a highly specialized spray drying and capsule filling process. Lastly, the expanded Chelsea facility will have to continue to comply with cGMP requirements, as described above in these risk factors, as well as other applicable environmental, safety, and other governmental permitting requirements. 
 If Catalent is unable to complete the expansion of the facility in a timely manner or there is unexpected demand for commercial quantities of Inbrija, there could be a supply shortage that would harm our commercialization of Inbrija. If we need the expanded capacity but Catalent is delayed in or prevented from completing the expansion and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, we may need to seek another party to manufacturer additional Inbrija supply for us. As further discussed below, there can be no assurance that we could identify another third party that would be capable and willing to 
 16


manufacture for us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they could supply us with product in sufficient quantities on a timely basis to meet our needs. If we cannot obtain increased supply of Inbrija from expanded capacity at the Chelsea facility or engaging another third party manufacturer, we may not be able to meet demand for Inbrija and our ability to commercialize Inbrija could be harmed. Also, even if we do obtain Inbrija from another supplier, we may be unable to offset the costs of alternate supply against our minimum purchase commitments under the Catalent manufacturing services agreement, as further described below.
 Furthermore, if Catalent were to lose the use of the facility or equipment, the manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment would be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time and substantial additional funds. The facility may be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, or Catalent may lose the use of the facility due to manufacturing issues that arise, such as contamination or regulatory concerns following a regulatory inspection of the facility. Catalent may also unexpectedly experience manufacturing issues as the unintended result of activities occurring at the facility unrelated to Inbrija manufacture. In the event of a loss of the use of all or a portion of the facility or equipment for the reasons stated above or any other reason, Catalent would be unable to manufacture Inbrija until such time as the facility or equipment could be repaired or rebuilt or they are able to address other manufacturing issues at the facility. Any such interruptions in their ability to manufacture Inbrija would harm our business. Even if Catalent does not suffer a loss of the facility or equipment within the facility, manufacturing operations can experience intermittent interruptions due to the need for routine or unexpected maintenance, inspection and repairs of the facility or the equipment, and, depending on their frequency and duration, these intermittent interruptions could also harm our business.
 We do not currently have back-up manufacturing capability at another facility and there are only limited third party manufacturers that we believe would be capable of manufacturing Inbrija or other ARCUS inhaled therapeutic products or product candidates. If the need arises to obtain supply from another third party manufacturer, there can be no assurance that we could identify a third party that would be capable and willing to manufacture for us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they could supply us in sufficient quantities on a timely basis to meet our needs. Engaging a third party manufacturer to supply ARCUS products or product candidates would likely be a lengthy process due to the complexity and substantial regulation of the manufacturing processes involved. Also, engaging a third party would require the sharing of proprietary information, which increases the risk of unauthorized use or disclosure of that information and potential harm to our business for which we may not have an adequate remedy. If we are successful in engaging a third party manufacturer, they may not perform their obligations to us and/or they may be unable or unwilling to establish or increase production capacity commensurate with our needs. Also, third party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside of our control, including macro-economic conditions that may cause them to suffer liquidity or operational problems and that could interfere with their business operations.
 Catalent Manufacturing Services Agreement
 We sold our Chelsea manufacturing operations to Catalent Pharma Solutions in February 2021. In connection with the sale, we entered into a long-term, global manufacturing services (supply) agreement with a Catalent affiliate pursuant to which they have agreed to manufacture Inbrija for us at the Chelsea facility. The manufacturing services agreement provides that Catalent will manufacture Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), to our specifications, and we will purchase Inbrija exclusively from Catalent during the term of the manufacturing services agreement; provided that such exclusivity requirement will not apply to Inbrija intended for sale in China.
 The manufacturing services agreement, unless earlier terminated, will continue until December 31, 2030, and will be automatically extended for successive two-year periods unless either we or Catalent provides the other party with at least 18-months’ prior written notice of non-renewal. Either party may terminate the manufacturing services by written notice under certain circumstances, including material breach by the other party (subject to specified cure periods) or the insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the manufacturing services agreement upon certain specified regulatory events and for convenience upon 180 days’ prior written notice, subject to payment of a specified substantial termination fee.
 Under the manufacturing services agreement, we agreed to purchase from Catalent at least $16 million of Product in 2021 (pro-rated for a partial year) and $18 million of Product from 2022 through 2030 (and an additional amount in the last year in the case of such a proration), subject to reduction in certain cases. We are obligated to provide Catalent with a rolling 24-month forecast of production requirements, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order by us. Catalent is required to reserve sufficient capacity for the manufacture of a specified amount of Inbrija per year, with such capacity reservation to be reviewed on an annual basis.
 17


In addition, the manufacturing services agreement grants to Catalent a non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, non-transferrable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to certain of our intellectual property in order to enable the manufacture of Inbrija. Catalent has granted to us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, paid-up, royalty-free, assignable and sublicensable license to certain of its intellectual property as reasonably necessary to allow us to commercialize Inbrija.
 The manufacturing services agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property created pursuant to the manufacturing services agreement, as well as provisions relating to ordering, payment and shipping terms, regulatory matters, reporting obligations, indemnity, confidentiality and other matters.
 Currently, we are not investing in any research and development programs pending further progress with the Inbrija launch. However, should we decide in the future to make investments in any ARCUS development program, we would be reliant on Catalent for the manufacture of product for that program. The manufacturing services agreement does not provide for the terms and conditions under which Catalent would supply any product or product candidate other than Inbrija. We would be unable to advance the development of any ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidate unless Catalent is willing to manufacture the candidate for us on commercially reasonable terms.
 Supply of Inbrija Components
 Catalent, as our Inbrija supplier, is responsible for all Inbrija components other than the inhaler device and levodopa, or L-dopa, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Inbrija. We have relied, and we expect to continue relying, on single third-parties to supply the inhaler and levodopa. We do not control how Catalent sources the other Inbrija components. Also, we rely on a single third party to package Inbrija kits after they are manufactured. Any failure or delay by a third party manufacturer, packager or supplier may delay or impair our ability to meet demand for Inbrija and could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization of Inbrija or to complete any future clinical studies that may be needed. 
 Although in some cases we have contracts for these requirements, we cannot be certain that those contracts will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We do not have contracts with the supplier of the API used in the manufacture of Inbrija, which exposes us to the risk that they could discontinue supply at any time. Manufacturers, packagers or suppliers may choose not to conduct business with us at all, or may choose to discontinue doing business with us, for example if they determine that our particular business requirements would be unprofitable or otherwise not appropriate for their business. We do not control how Catalent sources the other components of Inbrija, and our business could similarly be exposed to risk if and to the extent they rely on single source suppliers or do not have supply contracts.
 Our proprietary Inbrija inhalers are manufactured using standard manufacturing processes and are shipped fully assembled to us. We own the molds and design history files for the inhalers. We currently source our proprietary Inbrija inhalers from a single third party plastic molding manufacturer for the Inbrija inhalers. Our reliance on a single third party for the manufacture of inhalers increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our inhalers or will not be able to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could harm our commercialization of Inbrija. If the inhaler supplier fails to provide sufficient inhaler supply, we would need enter into alternative arrangements with a different suppler. Transition to a new inhaler supplier would be a lengthy and complex process. Among other things, we would have to revalidate the molding and assembly processes pursuant to FDA requirements and we would have to ensure that inhalers manufactured by the new supplier adhere to other applicable regulatory requirements.
 All other raw materials used for Inbrija manufacture are standard in pharmaceutical production.
 Ampyra
 We are party to a September 2003 agreement with Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes’ 2011 acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business) for our clinical and commercial supply of Ampyra. Under that agreement, we are required to purchase at least 75% of our annual commercial requirements of Ampyra from Alkermes unless Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements. In addition, the agreement also obligates us to make compensatory payments if we do not purchase 100% of our requirements from Alkermes.
 As permitted by our agreement with Alkermes, we have designated Patheon, Inc. as a second manufacturing source of Ampyra. In connection with that designation, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Patheon, and Alkermes 
 18


assisted us in transferring manufacturing technology to Patheon. We and Alkermes have agreed that we may purchase up to 25% of our annual requirements from Patheon if we make compensatory payments to Alkermes. In addition, Patheon may supply us with Ampyra if Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements.
 Under a Consent Agreement among Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes’ acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business), Biogen and us, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of our rights under our agreements with Alkermes to Biogen. The three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under these agreements with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors, permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities, and requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances.
 We and Alkermes rely on a single third party manufacturer to supply dalfampridine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, in Ampyra, and also on a single supplier for a critical excipient used in the manufacture of Ampyra. We also rely on a single third party to package Ampyra. If these companies experience any disruption in their operations, our supply of Ampyra could be delayed or interrupted until the problem is solved or we locate another source of supply or another packager, which may not be available. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply or packaging arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable, if at all. Any new supplier or packager would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. Because of these and other factors, we could experience substantial delays before we are able to obtain qualified replacement products or services from any new supplier or packager.
 Also, under our supply agreement with Alkermes, we provide Alkermes with monthly written 18-month forecasts and with annual written five-year forecasts for our supply requirements of Ampyra. In each of the three months for Ampyra following the submission of our written 18-month forecast, we are obligated to purchase the quantity specified in the forecast, even if our actual requirements are greater or less. Given the introduction of generic competition to Ampyra in the market, it may be difficult to forecast the level of supply needed to satisfy our requirements in the future. 
Intellectual Property
 We have patent portfolios relating to: Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder); Ampyra/aminopyridines; the ARCUS drug delivery technology; cimaglermin alfa/neuregulins; and remyelinating antibodies/antibodies relating to nervous system disorders. These portfolios are composed of both our own and in-licensed patents and patent applications. Our intellectual property also includes copyrights, confidential and trade secret information as well as a portfolio of trademarks.
 The intellectual property relating to our programs is owned or licensed either directly by Acorda or indirectly through a subsidiary, including for example our Civitas Therapeutics, Inc. subsidiary. Throughout this report, we may refer to any and all such intellectual property, and the corresponding research and development programs as, “our” or “Acorda’s” programs.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) and ARCUS Development Programs 
 The intellectual property portfolio that we acquired with Civitas has over 100 issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to Inbrija and the ARCUS drug delivery technology. This includes over 13 issued U.S. patents relating to Inbrija directed to compositions of the drug product, the inhaler, the capsule for the drug product, methods of delivery of L-dopa, and manufacturing processes. We have several patents listed in the Orange Book for Inbrija, including patents expiring between 2022 and 2032, and Inbrija is entitled to three years of new product exclusivity, through December 21, 2021, as posted in the Orange Book. We have patents in Europe for Inbrija expiring between 2022 and 2033. One of our European patents, EP 3090773B, has been opposed by an unnamed party. Inbrija also has 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe.
 Ampyra/aminopyridines 
 There are no patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra. Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents.
 There are two European patents, EP 1732548 and EP 2377536, with claims directed to use of a sustained release dalfampridine composition (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union) to increase walking speed in a 
 19


patient with multiple sclerosis. Both European patents are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Nullity actions have been filed in Germany against both of the German national patents derived from EP 173548 and EP 2377536 by ratiopharm GmbH, a generic manufacturer affiliated with Teva. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021.
 We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
 Cimaglermin alfa/Neuregulins
 Our neuregulin portfolio includes granted and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to the use of neuregulins (e.g., GGF2) to treat peripheral nerve injury, non-acute central nervous system injuries and heart failure. We are also the exclusive licensee under a license agreement with Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals, plc), of patent rights related to specific uses of specific neuregulins.
 Remyelinating Antibodies/Antibodies Related to Nervous System Disorders
 Acorda is the exclusive licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to a series of remyelinating antibodies and their use discovered by scientists at the Mayo Clinic. This portfolio also includes granted and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to additional antibodies and their use. With regard to remyelinating antibodies, the portfolio includes granted and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications for use in combination with the additional antibodies in treating cerebral ischemia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Trademarks
 In addition to patents, our intellectual property portfolio includes registered trademarks, along with pending trademark applications. We own several registered trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. These registered trademarks include, in the U.S., the marks “Acorda Therapeutics,” our stylized Acorda Therapeutics logo, “Biotie Therapies,” “Ampyra,” “Inbrija,” and “ARCUS.” We also have trademark registrations for “Fampyra” and “Inbrija” and pending trademark applications therefore, in numerous foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our trademark portfolio includes several trademark registrations and pending trademark applications for potential product names and for disease awareness activities.
Competition
 The market for developing and marketing pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are engaged in research, development and/or marketing of therapeutics for various neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, human and other resources than we do. Furthermore, many of these companies have significantly more experience than we do in preclinical testing, human clinical trials, regulatory approval procedures and sales and marketing.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)/Parkinson’s Disease
 Inbrija competes against other therapies approved for intermittent, or as needed, use that aim to specifically address Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, is approved for the treatment of OFF periods, also known as OFF episodes. Apokyn was approved for this use in the U.S. in 2004 and in Europe in 1993. Also, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. has developed a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine branded as Kynmobi that is competitive with Inbrija. Sunovion received FDA approval for Kynmobi in May 2020 for the acute, intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, and Kymobi became available in the U.S. in September 2020.
 The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and the amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. Inbrija may face competition from therapies that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods. Approaches to achieve consistent levodopa plasma concentrations include new formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, such as extended-release and intestinal infusions, and therapies that prolong the effect of levodopa. Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Impax Laboratories) markets RYTARY, an extended-release formulation of oral carbidopa/levodopa, and extended release formulations of oral and patch carbidopa/levodopa are being 
 20


developed by others including Intec Pharma and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation. Also, Abbvie Inc. has developed a continuous administration of a gel-containing levodopa through a tube that is surgically implanted into the intestine. This therapy, known as Duopa, has been approved by the FDA and is approved in the EU.
 One or more of our competitors may utilize their expertise in pulmonary delivery of drugs to develop and obtain approval for pulmonary delivery products that may compete with Inbrija and any other of our other ARCUS drug delivery technology product candidates. These competitors may include smaller companies such as Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MannKind Corporation, Pulmatrix, Inc. and Vectura Group plc and larger companies such as Allergan, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc and Novartis AG, among others. If approved, our product candidates may face competition in the target commercial areas for these pulmonary delivery products. Also, we are aware that at least one company, Impel Neuropharma, is developing intranasally delivered levodopa therapies which, if approved, might compete with Inbrija.
 Ampyra/MS
 Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.
 Current disease management approaches to MS are classified either as relapse management, disease course management, or symptom management approaches. For relapse management, the majority of neurologists treat sudden and severe relapses with a four-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids. Many of these corticosteroids are available generically. For disease course management, there are a number of FDA-approved MS therapies that seek to modify the immune system. These treatments attempt to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS, though their precise mechanisms of action are not known. These products include Avonex, Tysabri, Plegridy and Tecfidera from Biogen, Betaseron from Bayer AG, Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Rebif from Merck Serono, Gilenya and Extavia from Novartis AG, Aubagio and Lemtrada from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Glatopa from Sandoz International GmbH (a Novartis AG company), Zinbryta from Biogen and AbbieVie, Rituxan from F. Hoffman-La Roche AG, and Zeposia from BristolMyersSquibb.
 Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including MS. Other companies also have products in clinical development, including products approved for other indications in MS, to address improvement of walking ability in people with MS. This potential product may compete with Ampyra in the future. Furthermore, several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell therapy approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with MS. These programs are in early stages of development and may compete in the future with Ampyra or some of our product candidates. In addition, in certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis, which is referred to as compounding. We are aware that at present compounded dalfampridine is used by some people with MS and it is possible that some people will want to continue to use compounded formulations even though Ampyra and generic versions of Ampyra are commercially available.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical testing, clinical development, manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, sale, promotion, import and export of our products and product candidates.
FDA Regulation of Drugs and Drug Product Approval
 In the U.S., Ampyra and our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as drugs but, as further discussed below, Inbrija is regulated as a combination product because it has both a drug and a device component. Drugs, biologics, and medical devices are regulated primarily under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA. These products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage of development may result in various adverse 
 21


consequences, including the FDA's and other health authorities' delay in approving or refusal to approve a product. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Similar civil or criminal penalties could be imposed by other government agencies or agencies of the states and localities in which our products are tested, manufactured, sold or distributed.
 The process required by the FDA under these laws before our drug and biological product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biologic, for each intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of whether each facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission and FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the case of a drug, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, containing preclinical and clinical data, proposed labeling, information to demonstrate that the product will be manufactured to appropriate standards, and other required information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its safety and potential efficacy. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND sponsor may initiate clinical trials 30 days after filing the IND application, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, charged with protecting the welfare of human subjects involved in research at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical trial before it commences at that center. The IRB(s) must continue to monitor the trial until its completion. Many studies also employ a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, with experts who are otherwise independent of the conduct of the study and are given access to the unblinded study data periodically during the study to determine whether the study should be halted. For example, a DSMB might halt a study if an unacceptable safety issue emerges, or if the data showing the effectiveness of the study drug would make it unethical to continue giving patients placebo. Study subjects must provide informed consent before their participation in the research study.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially administered into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to confirm the clinical efficacy from Phase 2 and to further test for safety in an expanded population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in affected patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target condition, these clinical trials may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these clinical trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1b clinical trials.
 Before proceeding with a Phase 3 trial, sponsors may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. SPAs help establish up front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of the design of a clinical trial, but the agreement does not guarantee FDA approval even if the SPA is followed. For example, a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug could be identified after the testing has begun. In addition, even if an SPA remains in place and the trial meets its endpoints with statistical significance, the FDA could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for the product candidate is not adequate to support approval, or only justifies approval for a narrow set of clinical uses, or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements or limitations.
 Federal law requires the submission of registry and results information for most clinical trials to a publicly available database at www.clinicaltrials.gov. These requirements generally do not apply to Phase 1 clinical trials.
 U.S. law requires that trials conducted to support approval for product marketing be "adequate and well controlled." This entails a number of requirements, including that there is a clear statement of objectives and methods in the protocol, the study design permits a valid comparison with a control (e.g., a placebo, another drug already approved for the studied condition, or a non-concurrent control such as historical data), and that the statistical methods used to analyze the data are adequate to assess the effects of the drug. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements.
 We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRBs or the DSMB may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold or terminate them at any point in this process if, among other reasons, they conclude that study subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 In the U.S., for most drugs and biologics, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval prior to marketing and commercial distribution of the product candidate. If the product candidate is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. If the product candidate, such as an antibody, is regulated as a biologic, a BLA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA or BLA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning safety and effectiveness (for a drug) and safety, purity and potency (for a biologic) of the compound from laboratory, animal and clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product stability, and proposed product labeling.
 Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA or BLA and must be registered with the FDA. The application will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process for the drug or biological product, and determines that the facility is in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. If the manufacturing facilities and processes fail to pass the FDA inspection, we will not receive approval to market these products, or approval will likely be delayed until the manufacturing issues are resolved. The FDA may also inspect clinical trial sites and/or the clinical sponsor for compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP. If the FDA determines that one or more of our clinical trials were not conducted in accordance with GCP, the agency may determine not to consider effectiveness data generated from such clinical trials in support of our applications for marketing approval.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing an NDA or BLA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees could be significant.
 Once an NDA or BLA is submitted for FDA approval, the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing if deemed complete, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs and BLAs: six months for priority applications and 10 months for regular applications, with two additional months added to each period for new molecular entities. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these 
 23


performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if favorable, often is not an actual approval but an “action letter” or “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. This additional work could include substantial additional clinical trials. The FDA's review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee.
 The FDA may deny an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If the FDA approves a product, it will limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, may require that contraindications or warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional post-approval studies or clinical trials be conducted as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or may otherwise limit the scope of any approval. Under a REMS, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on distribution and use of a marketed product, may require the distribution of medication guides to patients and/or healthcare professionals or patient communication plans, and may impose a timetable for submission of assessments of the effectiveness of a REMS. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically take several years or more and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time or permanently and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, labeling changes or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain and maintain, regulatory approvals for our products and product candidates would harm our business. Marketing our product candidates abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 Any products manufactured or distributed in the U.S. by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements relating to record-keeping, labeling, packaging, reporting of adverse experiences and other reporting, advertising and promotion, distribution, cGMPs, and import/export, as well as any other requirements imposed by the applicant’s NDA or BLA. The FDA's rules for advertising and promotion require, among other things, that our promotion be truthful, fairly balanced and adequately substantiated, and that our labeling bears adequate directions for all intended uses of the product. We must also submit appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. On its own initiative, the FDA may require changes to the labeling of an approved drug, require post-approval studies or clinical trials, or impose a REMS post-approval if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency believes impacts the drug’s safety profile. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Foreign drug manufacturers must comply with similar local requirements and may be subject to inspections by the FDA or local regulatory agencies. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with cGMPs and other regulatory requirements. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.
 In addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities related to the other regulatory requirements that apply to marketed drugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our review and reporting of adverse events, or related to compliance with the requirements of the PDMA concerning the handling of drug samples. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations on FDA Form 483. The observations may be more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the FDA's concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions.
 24


We and our product candidates are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where they are or will be marketed, or where we may have operations. For example, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Federal law and some states also impose requirements on manufacturers, distributors, and other trading partners that govern the introduction and movement of product through the supply chain, including requirements for the exchange of transaction documentation, development of systems capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain, and responding to requests from trading partners and government agencies. Any applicable federal, state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities.
 The FDA's policies may change and additional U.S. or foreign government laws and/or regulations may be enacted which could impose additional burdens or limitations on our ability to obtain approval of our product candidates or market our products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in government scrutiny or new regulations that could harm our business. For example, significant price increases in recent years by certain drug manufacturers have received considerable scrutiny from U.S. Congress, in some cases forcing those companies to dramatically reduce those prices. There continues to be political pressure at both the U.S. federal and state levels related to drug pricing and drug transparency that could result in legislative or administrative actions, such as the State of California’s passage of SB 17 in 2017, or at a minimum continued scrutiny. California SB 17, for example, put in place new state reporting and notification requirements for manufacturers related to drug pricing, which became effective January 1, 2018. In May 2018, the former Trump presidential administration issued "American Patients First," a multi-faceted blueprint to lower drug prices and subsequently took administrative steps to implement the blueprint, including through proposing sweeping demonstration projects aimed at putting downward pressure on drug prices. In addition, members of Congress have indicated an interest in legislative measures designed to lower drug costs. The new Biden administration has indicated that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, but we do not yet know what steps the administration will take or whether such steps will be successful. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 Generic Drugs, AB Ratings and Pharmacy Substitution
 Generic drugs are approved through an abbreviated regulatory process, which differs in important ways from the process followed for innovative products. For generic versions of drugs subject to an NDA, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, is filed with the FDA. The ANDA must seek approval of a product candidate that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use (labeling) as a so-called "reference listed drug" that has already been approved pursuant to a full NDA. Only limited exceptions exist to this ANDA sameness requirement, including certain limited variations approved by the FDA through a special suitability petition process. ANDA applicants are not required to submit clinical data to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Instead, the FDA relies on its findings of safety and effectiveness of the reference listed drug to approve the ANDA. As a result, the law requires the ANDA applicant submit only limited clinical data to demonstrate that the product covered by the ANDA is absorbed in the body at a rate and extent consistent with that of the reference listed drug. This is known as bioequivalence. In addition, the ANDA must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. It also must contain certifications with respect to all patents that are listed for the reference listed drug in the FDA’s publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” commonly known as the “Orange Book.”
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, drugs that are new chemicals entities, or NCEs, are eligible for a five-year data exclusivity period. During this period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA submitted by another company that relies on any of the data submitted by the innovator company. This exclusivity period also applies to “505(b)(2)” applications, which are hybrid applications that rely in-part on pioneer data and in-part on new clinical data submitted to account for differences between the 505(b)(2) product and the reference listed drug. ANDA applicants and 505(b)(2) applicants must certify to all patents listed in the Orange Book for the reference listed drug (i.e., the innovator NDA). An ANDA (or 505(b)(2) application) may be submitted to FDA after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of those listed patents. The statute also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA (or NDA supplement) that is not an NCE if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed essential to approval. During this period, the FDA will not approve an application filed by a third party for the protected conditions of use that relies on any of the data that was submitted by the innovator company. Neither exclusivity period blocks the approval of full applications (i.e., full NDAs) submitted to the FDA because full NDAs do not rely on a pioneer’s data.
 25


Special procedures apply when an ANDA contains one or more certifications stating that a listed patent is invalid or not infringed. This is known as a “Paragraph IV” certification. If the owner of the patent or the NDA for the reference listed drug brings a patent infringement suit within a specified time after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, an automatic stay bars FDA approval of the ANDA for 30 months, which period may be extended under certain circumstances. The length of the automatic stay depends on whether the FDA classifies the reference listed drug as an NCE, as follows:
  
• | If the FDA does not classify the reference listed drug as an NCE, then the automatic stay is for 30 months from the date that the manufacturer of the reference listed drug receives the patent certification described above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If the reference listed drug is classified by the FDA as an NCE, then the length of the automatic stay depends on when the ANDA is filed. No company can file an ANDA on a reference listed drug that the FDA has designated as an NCE until five years after the reference listed drug’s FDA approval, except that an ANDA may be submitted four years after the reference listed drug’s FDA approval if the ANDA contains a Paragraph IV patent certification. If an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is filed five or more years after FDA approval of the NCE, then the stay duration is 30 months. However, if an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is filed in between the fourth and fifth years after FDA approval of the NCE, the automatic 30 month stay is extended by a number of months equal to the number of months remaining in the fifth year after approval of the reference listed drug, providing a total of up to a 42 month stay.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the stay is either lifted or expires and the FDA approves the ANDA, the generic manufacturer may decide to begin selling its product even if patent litigation is pending. However, if the generic manufacturer launches before patent litigation is resolved, the launch is at the risk of the generic manufacturer being later held liable for patent infringement damages.
 Many states require or permit pharmacists to substitute generic equivalents for brand-name prescriptions unless the physician has prohibited substitution. Managed care organizations often urge physicians to prescribe drugs with generic equivalents, and to authorize substitution, as a means of controlling costs of prescriptions. They also may require lower copayments as an incentive to patients to ask for and accept generics.
 While the question of substitutability is one of state law, most states look to the FDA to determine whether a generic is substitutable. The FDA lists therapeutic equivalence ratings in the “Orange Book.” In general, a generic drug that is listed in the Orange Book as therapeutically equivalent to the branded product will be substitutable under state law and, conversely, a generic drug that is not so listed will not be substitutable. Drug products that the FDA considers to be therapeutically equivalent to other drug products receive one of various types of “A” ratings. For example, solid oral dosage form drug products that are considered therapeutically equivalent are generally rated “AB” in the Orange Book, while therapeutically equivalent solutions and powders for aerosolization generally receive an “AB” or an “AN” rating depending on how bioequivalence was demonstrated.
 To be considered therapeutically equivalent, a generic drug must first be a pharmaceutical equivalent of the branded drug. This means that the generic has the same active ingredient, dosage form, strength or concentration and route of administration as the branded drug. Tablets and capsules are currently considered different dosage forms that are pharmaceutical alternatives and therefore are not substitutable pharmaceutical equivalents. In addition to being pharmaceutical equivalents, therapeutic equivalents must be bioequivalent to their branded counterparts. Bioequivalence for this purpose is defined in the same manner as for ANDA approvals, and usually requires a showing of comparable rate and extent of absorption in a small human study.
 The process described above is not applicable to drugs where the pioneer product was approved pursuant to a BLA, rather than an NDA. A separate process exists for follow-on versions of such products and is discussed in the section entitled “Biosimilars,” below.
 Requirements Applicable to Medical Devices in the United States
 The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, effectiveness, storage, record keeping, marketing, import, export, and distribution of medical devices. The level of regulation applied by the FDA generally depends on the class into which the medical device falls: Class I, II, or III. Class I medical devices present the lowest risk, and Class III medical devices present the highest risk. In general, the higher class of device, the greater the degree of regulatory control. All devices, for example, are subject to “General Controls,” which include:
 26


 
• | Establishment registration by manufacturers, distributors, re-packagers, and re-labelers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Device listing with FDA;
--+-------------------------


• | Good manufacturing practices;
--+------------------------------


• | Labeling regulations; and
--+--------------------------


• | Reporting of adverse events.
--+-----------------------------

 Class II medical devices are subject to General Controls, but also Special Controls, including special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, additional post market surveillance, and specific FDA guidance. Most Class III medical devices are assessed individually through an extensive Premarket Review application, or PMA. As a result, although they are subject to General Controls, they generally are not subject to Special Controls. Instead, most Class III devices have additional requirements and conditions of use imposed on them through the individualized PMA review and approval process.
 Although we do not manufacture or market stand-alone medical devices, Inbrija relies on a device component (the inhaler) to deliver drug product to patients. In general, the FDA regulates that type of product as a “combination product.” The FDA assigns combination products for review by the drug or device center based on a determination of the product’s “primary mode of action.” If the FDA determines that the product achieves its therapeutic effect through drug component, as was the case with Inbrija, it will be assigned to the Center for Drugs (CDER) or the Center for Biologics (CBER) for review and approval. By contrast, if the FDA determines that the device component is the primary mode of action, then the product will be reviewed and approved by the center for devices (CDRH). CDER is the lead review division for Inbrija. We anticipate that to the extent that any of our other pipeline products are regulated as combination products, the FDA likely will find that the primary mode of action is through the drug component, and therefore the product will be reviewed by CDER. In that case, however, CDER/CBER will consult with CDRH on the drug component and we will still have to comply with certain requirements applicable to medical devices.
 Most Class I devices are exempt from the FDA premarket review or approval. With some exceptions, Class II devices may be marketed only if the FDA “clears” the medical device through the 510(k) process, which requires a company to show that the device is “substantially equivalent” to certain devices already on the market. Again with some exceptions, Class III devices are approved through a PMA, which generally requires an applicant to submit data from clinical trials that establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. Clinical data are sometimes required for a 510(k) application as well. Manufacturers conducting clinical trials with medical devices are subject to similar requirements as those conducting clinical trials with drugs or biologics. For example, a manufacturer must obtain an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to test a significant risk device in humans, must comply with GCPs, and must obtain IRB approval. Although Inbrija includes a medical device component (the inhaler), Inbrija is a combination product that was approved by CDER via an NDA and these medical device clearance/approval requirements are not applicable to Inbrija.
 The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for drugs and biologics. For example, medical devices are subject to detailed manufacturing standards under the FDA’s quality systems regulations, or QSRs, and specific rules regarding labeling and promotion. Medical device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their products with the FDA.
 States also impose regulatory requirements on medical device manufacturers and distributors, including registration and record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable federal and state medical device requirements could result in, among other things, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or clearance, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or other civil or criminal penalties.
 Biosimilars
 The Affordable Care Act amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize the FDA to approve “biosimilars” (follow-on versions of pioneer products approved pursuant to a BLA) via a separate, abbreviated pathway. Under this abbreviated pathway, the biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that its product is “highly similar” to the “reference product,” and that there are no “clinically meaningful differences” between the biosimilar and the reference product. Unlike ANDAs, 
 27


biosimilars are not, in general, automatically substitutable for the reference product at the pharmacy. Instead, the FDA must make a separate finding of “interchangeability.” To date, the trend in state law has been to permit or require substitution only of those biosimilars that have also been deemed by the FDA to be interchangeable.
 The Affordable Care Act also established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity against biosimilars for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the BLA-holders’ regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the reference product’s data in its approved BLA. In contrast to the provisions for NDAs, the biologics data exclusivity provisions do not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products, or otherwise create an “automatic stay” of FDA approval of a biosimilar. If our product candidates are approved as biologics, they may face significant competition from biosimilars in the future.
 Foreign Regulation and Product Approval
 Outside the U.S., our ability or the ability of one of our collaborators to market a product candidate is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement can vary widely from country to country. The foreign regulatory approval process involves risks very similar to those associated with FDA approval discussed above. 
 Within the European Union, or EU, it is possible to obtain marketing authorizations that enable an approved product to be marketed in the entire European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the EU member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. This can be through the “centralized procedure” which is mandatory for certain products, including biotechnology and advanced therapy medicinal products, orphan medicines and new active substances for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, or through the “mutual recognition” or “decentralized” procedure, which provides for the approval of a product by one or more member states based on an assessment of an application review performed by one or more other member states. The foreign regulatory approval process involves risks very similar to those associated with FDA approval discussed above.
 On September 19, 2019, the European Commission granted a marketing authorization to Inbrija, for the intermittent treatment of episodic motor fluctuations (OFF episodes) in adult patients with Parkinson’s disease treated with a levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor. This marketing authorization was granted through the centralized procedure and is therefore valid throughout the EEA. The marketing authorization is valid for five years and once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period thereafter. If a product approved under the centralized procedure is not marketed in at least one EU member state within three years of the grant of the marketing authorization, the marketing authorization lapses under the EU’s sunset rules.
 Products such as Inbrija that combine a drug and device co-packaged in a single presentation are regulated under the EU’s medicines rules and approved under a single marketing authorization. As part of the marketing authorization process, the applicant must demonstrate to EU regulators that the device component conforms with the essential legal requirements for medical devices under EU law and, accordingly, bears the CE-mark. Currently, the essential requirements are contained in the EU Medical Device (Directive 98/79/EC), or MDD. As of May 26, 2021, the Medical Device Directive will be repealed and replaced by the new EU Medical Device Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745), or MDR, and the essential requirements for medical devices set out therein will apply from that date, subject to a transitional period. The transitional period applies to medical devices whose certificates of conformity were issued by a notified body under the MDD after May 25, 2017. The transitional period permits devices to be placed on the market under such circumstances until the sooner of (i) the date of expiry of the certificate; or (ii) a long stop date of May 27, 2024. 
 In the EU, innovator products, approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package are usually entitled to a total of 10 years of regulatory exclusivity from the date of first approval. This means that for a period of eight years, EU authorities may not accept marketing authorization applications that rely on the safety and efficacy data contained in the marketing authorization dossier of the innovator product. At the end of that period, generic applicants may file and authorities may review such applications. The innovator product is protected by a further two years of market exclusivity before any generic product may launch, such that the innovator product benefits from total regulatory exclusivity period of 10 years. 
 Inbrija received its EU marketing authorization on the basis of a complete and independent data package and therefore benefits from the 10-year regulatory exclusivity period described above (i.e., eight years of data exclusivity plus two additional years of market exclusivity).
 28


The fact that a product benefits from regulatory exclusivity does not prevent competitors from obtaining a marketing authorization based on their own independently generated data. EU regulatory authorities have stated that they consider levodopa, which is the active substance contained in Inbrija, to be a “known active substance.” In principle, this means that generic competitors could – during Inbrija’s regulatory exclusivity period -- file and receive a marketing authorization referring, for example, to data from the dossiers of older, established products containing levodopa, supplemented with other data that the competitor generates itself (e.g., demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the inhaled dosage form).
 As the marketing authorization holder for Inbrija in the EU, we are required to comply with a number of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal products. In particular, a marketing authorization holder’s obligations include complying with the EU’s pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules. All marketing authorizations include a Risk Mitigation Plan, or RMP, describing the risk mitigation measures that a marketing authorization holder must put in place, including post-authorization obligations such as additional safety monitoring or the conduct of post-authorization safety studies. RMPs are intended to be updated throughout the lifetime of a medicine and marketing authorization holders are expected to submit updated RMPs as new information becomes available or at the request of EU regulatory authorities.
 Other regulatory requirements relate, for example, to the manufacturing of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for coordinating inspections conducted by member state competent authorities to verify compliance with various aspects of the EU’s medicines rules. In respect of inspecting manufacturing sites, in July 2019 the EU and U.S. implemented a mutual recognition agreement, or MRA, under which EU and U.S. regulators will now rely on each other’s inspections for manufacturing sites for human medicines in their respective territories.
 Non-compliance with EU requirements, particularly regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, can also result in the marketing authorization holder becoming subject to significant financial penalties. Inspections may be routine or triggered by issues arising during the assessment of the dossier or by other information, such as previous inspection experience. Inspections usually are requested during the initial review of a marketing authorization application, but could arise post-authorization. Regulatory authorities in the EU may suspend, revoke or vary a marketing authorization of a medicinal product if they consider that the product is harmful, lacks therapeutic efficacy, its risk-benefit balance is not favorable, its qualitative and quantitative composition is not as declared or for certain other reasons.
 A marketing authorization holder may not delegate its ultimate legal responsibility for complying with its legal requirements nor any liability for failing to do so. However, the marketing authorization holder may delegate the performance of certain tasks to third parties, provided this is appropriately documented and managed. It is also possible to transfer a marketing authorization to a third party.
 The EU’s medicines rules do not require the launch of a product in a particular member state. However, once a medicinal product is launched in a member state, the marketing authorization holder is under a legal obligation to take steps to ensure it meets demand for the product in that country. The EU’s medicines rules also contain so-called sunset clauses, which provide that a marketing authorization will cease to be valid if the product in question is not placed on the market in at least one jurisdiction in the EEA within three years of the grant of the marketing authorization.
 As in the U.S., EU law and the regulatory systems in EU member states tightly regulate the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. Unlike in the U.S., EU law prohibits the advertising of prescription-only medicinal products (such as Inbrija) directly to patients or the general public. Advertising to healthcare professionals is permitted, provided certain conditions are met. Certain activities fall outside the scope of EU medicines advertising rules, such as direct responses to requests for information and the dissemination of factual, informative non-promotional announcements and reference material. All advertising for a medicine must be consistent with the product’s approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, factual, accurate, balanced and non-misleading. Advertisements to healthcare professionals must adhere to certain specific requirements. For example, the provision of inducements to healthcare professionals designed to promote the prescription, supply, sale or consumption of medicinal products is not permitted, and some member states have expanded this prohibition to cover inducements to healthcare organizations. The promotion of a medicine pre-approval is prohibited as is the promotion of off-label use and promotion that is inconsistent with the product’s SmPC. While EU law provides a framework for medicines advertising rules, national laws, guidance and regulatory codes (or self-regulatory codes) can lead to differences in approach at the national level.
 29


Other Regulations
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products, as well as medical devices, are potentially subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and state and local governments. Controlled substances that are scheduled by the DEA are subject to additional regulatory requirements including, among other things, special security and handling requirements, and potential restrictions on distribution, sales, marketing. Sales, marketing, scientific/educational grant programs and other Acorda interactions with healthcare professionals, must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act and the False Claims Act, and may be affected by the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and/or the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. For products to be covered by Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services on behalf of the states and must regularly submit certain pricing information to CMS. Under the VHCA, we are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, or DOD, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, discounted prices must also be offered for certain DOD purchases for its TRICARE retail pharmacy program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Under the Sunshine Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to federal reporting requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Reports submitted under these requirements are placed on a public database. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS annually. Beginning with reports submitted in 2022 (for calendar year 2021), the Sunshine Act will also apply to payments to physician assistants and advance practice nurses. Similarly, the ACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to annually report to FDA samples of prescription drugs requested by and distributed to healthcare providers. The law does not state whether these sample disclosures will be made publicly available, and the FDA has not provided any additional guidance as to how the data will be used.
 Our research and development and manufacturing activities are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including, among other matters, those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous substances; the exposure of persons to hazardous substances; the release of pollutants into the air and bodies of water; and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Our research and development and manufacturing activities and the activities of our third party manufacturers involve the use of hazardous substances, and the risk of injury, contamination or noncompliance with the applicable environmental, health and safety requirements cannot be eliminated. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Although compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent legal or regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs to us.
 Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
 In many of markets where we or a collaborator markets or may potentially market one of our approved products, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls, by law, and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms.
 In the U.S., there has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years. Although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the U.S., federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to certain public healthcare programs, such as Medicaid, in order for the drugs to 
 30


be eligible for reimbursement under those programs. Various states have adopted further mechanisms under Medicaid and other programs that seek to control drug prices, including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers. Managed care has also become a potent force in the marketplace that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products. Recent heightened scrutiny of the prices of several drug products have led to numerous other proposals, at both the federal and state level, to address perceived issues related to drug pricing and drug transparency. Several other states have adopted or are considering adopting laws that require pharmaceutical companies to provide notice prior to raising pricing and other information related to price increases. In May 2018, the former Trump presidential administration issued "American Patients First," a multi-faceted blueprint to lower drug prices and subsequently took administrative steps to implement the blueprint, including through proposing sweeping demonstration projects aimed at putting downward pressure on drug prices. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule through the CMS Innovation Center whereby Medicare Part B reimbursement for “certain high-cost prescriptions drugs” would be no more than most-favored-nation price (i.e., the lowest price) after adjustments, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. In addition, members of the U.S. Congress have indicated an interest in legislative measures designed to lower drug costs. The new Biden administration has indicted that lowering prescription drug prices is a priority, but we do not yet know what steps the administration will take or whether such steps will be successful. 
 Under the reimbursement methodology set forth in the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, physicians are reimbursed for drugs they administer to Medicare beneficiaries based on a product's "average sales price," or ASP. This ASP-based reimbursement methodology has generally led to lower reimbursement levels. The MMA also established the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, which is provided primarily through private entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The ACA, as amended, requires drug manufacturers to provide a 70% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.”
 The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 resulted in changes to the way average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price are reported to the government and the formula for calculating required Medicaid rebates. The ACA increased the minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs to 23.1% and requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay states rebates on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, the ACA increased the additional Medicaid rebate on “line extensions” (such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, revised the definition of AMP by changing the classes of purchasers included in the calculation, and expanded the entities eligible for discounts under a statutory program available to entities identified under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act.
 The ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer’s market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs. The ACA also contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing the way that healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, increased funding for comparative effectiveness research for use in the healthcare industry, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement, that will affect existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs.
 In December 2017, portions of the ACA dealing with the individual mandate insurance requirement were effectively repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and other aspects of the ACA may be altered or repealed by future legislation. In December 2018, a U.S. federal district court judge in Texas found the ACA’s individual mandate to be unconstitutional and therefore the entire law to be invalid. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the ruling regarding the individual mandate, but remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis of the question of severability and whether portions of the law remain invalid. The case is currently under consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court and a decision is expected by Summer 2021. Public and private healthcare payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private healthcare payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA and/or appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which

uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. There is extensive regulation of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement through health systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The grant of a marketing authorization in many jurisdictions does not necessarily guarantee that a product will be reimbursed in a particular jurisdiction. The approach taken varies by jurisdiction and in most cases a separate reimbursement approval is required. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement based on the results of health economic assessments. Others control the price of pharmaceutical products through reference pricing approaches where the reimbursement price is determined by the price in other jurisdictions. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
