ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
We are a retailer and distributor of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products typically found in retail pharmacies in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”). Prior to acquiring Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”) in August 2011 (see “Our Corporate History and Structure - HJ Group” below), we were primarily a retail pharmacy operator. We currently have one hundred and nine (109 store locations under the store brand “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” in Hangzhou city. We acquired four single drugstores in fiscal 2021. After the acquisition, we liquidated them and then opened four new stores with the four licenses of local government medical insurance reimbursement program.  During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company sold its Lin’An Jiuzhou Pharmacy Co., Ltd (“Lin’An Jiuzhou”), which runs ten stores in Linan City, to local investors for a total proceeds of $129,586. On the other side, we have been concentrating on new stores within Hangzhou metropolitan area and opened eleven stores in the fiscal year 2021. Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, we experienced a decline in the number of customer visits during the first three months of calendar 2020 due to the implementation of the lockdown policy in China. However, as China has been able to control the spread of COVID-19, the negative impacts have become limited.
 
We currently operate in four business segments in China: (1) retail drugstores, (2) online pharmacy, (3) wholesale business selling products similar to those we carry in our pharmacies, and (4) farming and selling herbs used for traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”). All of the above business are performed in China with no other international sales.
 
Our stores provide customers with a wide variety of pharmaceutical products, including prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, nutritional supplements, TCM, personal and family care products, and medical devices, as well as convenience products, including consumable, seasonal, and promotional items. Additionally, we have doctors licensed in both western medicine and TCM on site for consultation, examination and treatment of common ailments at scheduled hours. Four (4) stores have adjacent medical clinics offering urgent care (to provide treatment for minor ailments such as sprains, minor lacerations, and dizziness that can be treated on an outpatient basis), TCM (including acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and cupping) and minor outpatient surgical treatments (such as suturing). Our stores vary in size, but presently average close to 200 square meters per store. We attempt to tailor each store’s product offerings, physician access, and operating hours to suit the community where the store is located.
 
We operate our pharmacies (including the medical clinics) through the following companies in China that we control through contractual arrangements (refer to “Contractual Arrangements with HJ Group and the Key Personnel” below in this report regarding the details of contractual arrangements:
 

● | Hangzhou Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy Chain Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Pharmacy”), which we control contractually, operates our “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hangzhou Jiuzhou Clinic of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine (General Partnership) (“Jiuzhou Clinic”), which we control contractually, operates one (1) of our three (3) medical clinics; and

● | Hangzhou Jiuzhou Medical & Public Health Service Co., Ltd. (“Jiuzhou Service”), which we control contractually, operates our other medical clinics. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also offer OTC drugs and nutritional supplements for sale through a website (www.dada360.com) operated by Jiuzhou Pharmacy. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, retail revenue, including pharmacies, medical clinics accounted for approximately 57.2% of our total revenue, while online pharmacy revenue accounted for 16.8% of our total revenue.
 
Since August 2011, we have operated a wholesale business through Zhejiang Jiuxin Medicine Co., Ltd. (“Jiuxin Medicine”), distributing third-party pharmaceutical products (similar to those carried by our pharmacies) primarily to trading companies throughout China. Jiuxin Medicine is wholly owned by Jiuzhou Pharmacy. For the fiscal year March 31, 2021, wholesale revenue accounted for approximately 26.0% of our total revenue.

We also have an herb farming business cultivating and wholesaling herbs used for TCM. This business is conducted through Hangzhou Qianhong Agriculture Development Co., Ltd. (“Qianhong Agriculture”), a wholly-owned subsidiary. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we generated no revenue from our herb farming business.

Our Business
 
Pharmacies
 
As of March 31, 2021, we currently have one hundred and nine (109) pharmacies throughout Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang and neighborhood cities. Pharmacy sales accounted for approximately 77.2% of our retail revenue, and 57.2% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. We offer primarily third-party products at our pharmacies, including:

● | Approximately 1,232 prescription drugs (226 of which require a physician’s prescription and the remainder requiring customer personal information registration only), sales of which accounted for approximately 35.7% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately 1,480 OTC drugs, sales of which accounted for approximately 40.1% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately 294 nutritional supplements, including a variety of healthcare supplements, vitamin, mineral and dietary products, sales of which accounted for approximately 9.0% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | TCM, including drinkable herbal remedies and pre-packaged herbal mixtures for making soup, sales of which accounted for approximately 6.0% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sundry products (i.e., personal care products such as skin care, hair care and beauty products, convenience products such as soft drinks, packaged snacks, and other consumable, cleaning agents, stationeries, and seasonal and promotional items tailored to local consumer demand for convenience and quality), sales of which accounted for approximately 1.8% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medical devices (i.e., family planning and birth control products, early pregnancy test products, portable electronic diagnostic apparatus, rehabilitation equipment, and surgical tools such as hemostats, needle forceps and surgical scissors), sales of which accounted for approximately 7.4% of our retail revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31,2021. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We favor retail locations in well-established residential communities with relatively concentrated consumer purchasing power or are located in close proximity to local hospitals, and evaluate potential store sites to assess consumer traffic, visibility and convenience. Depending on its size, each drugstore has between two (2) to twenty-five (25) pharmacists on staff, all of whom are properly licensed. We only accept prescriptions from licensed health care providers, and verify the validity, accuracy, and completeness of all prescriptions. We also ask all prescription customers to disclose their drug allergies, current medical conditions, and current medications. Most pharmacies also maintain a TCM counter staffed by licensed herbalists.
 
After opening, a location without SHI coverage may take up to one year to achieve our projected revenue goals for that particular location. Various factors influence individual store revenue including, but not limited to: location, nearby competition, local population demographics, square footage, and government insurance coverage.
 
All of our one hundred and nine (109) of our drugstores are located in Hangzhou city.
 
To enhance our customers’ experience, we have licensed physicians available at several of our “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” locations for consultation, examination and treatment of common ailments at scheduled hours. In addition, our Daguan, Wenhua, Xiasha and Yueming stores have adjoining medical clinics that provide urgent care (for conditions such as sprains, minor lacerations, and dizziness), TCM treatments (including acupuncture, therapeutic massage, moxibustion, and cupping), and minor outpatient surgical treatments (such as suturing).
 
To ensure quality and personal attention for patients, we employ only licensed doctors and certified nurses and technicians. Patient treatment at our four (4) Jiuzhou Clinics and Jiuzhou Service, follow nationally established clinical practice guidelines from China’s Ministry of Health. We currently have sixty-four (64) physicians and fifty-three (53) clinic staff. In-store consultations and examinations by our physicians are provided free-of-charge to ensure that customers are being prescribed and taking the appropriate medication for their ailments, and to afford customers convenience.

We view our medical services as more consumer-driven than other health care specialties, because consumers requiring the types of medical services that we provide often seek treatment on their own accord. We have developed our medical services to respond to the public need for convenient access to medical consultations and/or care and the significant savings that we can provide as compared to a more traditional medical setting such as a hospital. Many of our patients often need immediate access to medical services, do not have a regular physician, or may lack suitable alternatives. Patient flow is derived from the physical presence of our drugstores, not from pre-existing doctor-patient relationships or referrals from other healthcare providers.
 
We generate limited revenue directly from our clinics. However, our clinic brings patients into our stores, where they then purchase medical products.
 
Online Sales
 
Since May 2010, we have been retailing OTC drugs and nutritional supplements on the Internet at www.dada360.com. Before November 2015, our subsidiary Quannuo Technology operated and maintained the website pursuant to the Internet Pharmaceutical Transaction Service Qualification Certificate issued by the National Medical Products Administration (the “NMPA”) of Zhejiang Province, which allows us to engage in online retail pharmaceutical sales throughout China. As we sold all our equity interests in Quannuo Technology in November 2015, we have transferred our online pharmacy operation function to Jiuzhou Pharmacy. We have established payment methods with banks and online intermediaries such as Alipay, and are cooperating with business-to-consumer online vendors such as Taobao. By using Taobao’s platform in addition to our own website as mentioned above, we can be exposed to a wider range of customers.
 
Online sales accounted for approximately 16.8% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Online sales accounted for approximately 11.6% of our total revenue, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
 
Wholesale
 
Since acquiring Jiuxin Medicine in August 2011, we have been distributing third-party products primarily to drug distributors throughout China, including:
 

● | Approximately 1,352 prescription drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 79.5% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to approximately 1,455 prescription drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 83.7% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately 1,572 OTC drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 18.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to approximately 1,662 OTC drugs, the sales of which accounted for approximately 14.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately 270 nutritional supplements, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.4% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to approximately 350 nutritional supplements, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.7% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sundry products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to Sundry products, the sales of which accounted for approximately 0.1% of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medical devices, the sales of which accounted for approximately 1.2% and 0.3%, of our wholesale revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wholesale revenue increased primarily as a result of our ability to resell certain products, which our retail stores made large orders on, to other vendors. As our retail drugstores achieved large quantity sales of certain brand name merchandise, we were able to negotiate for lower purchase prices than the market level on such merchandise. As a result, certain vendors who were unable to obtain better prices than ours, will turn to us for such merchandise, leading the wholesale volume to grow. On the other side, we have been trying to act as a local agent for well-known health products in Zhejiang Province. For example, we kept a strategic cooperation agreement with Dong’a Gelatin (DEEJ) and act as its local sale agent in Zhejiang Province. Until we can establish a new customer base and secure the status to serve as provincial or national exclusive sale agent for certain popular drugs, we do not expect our wholesale business to increase significantly in the immediate future.
 
Herb Farming
 
From 2010 to the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we had been cultivating and harvested ten (10) types of herbs, such as fructusrubi (used in TCM to promote blood circulation), white atractylodes rhizome (used in TCM to treat physical and mental fatigue), atractylodesmacrocephala (used in TCM to control sweating), ginkgo seeds (used in TCM to treat asthma), and ginkgo trees used for TCM on approximately forty eight (48) acres of leased land in Lin’an, approximately thirty (30) miles from Hangzhou.
 
We planted ginkgo trees during the year ended March 31, 2013. A ginkgo tree may have a growth period of up to twenty years before it is mature enough to harvest. Typically, the longer the plant grows, the more valuable it becomes. We plan to continue cultivating the trees in order to maximize their market value in the future. We may continue growing trees and cultivating other herbs in the future.
 
Herb farming revenue accounted for no revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021.
 
Our Customers
 
Retail Customers
 
For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, our pharmacies collectively served an average of 15,509 customers per day. We periodically conduct qualitative customer surveys to help us build a stronger understanding of our market position and our customers’ purchasing habits.
 
Pharmacy customers pay by cash, debit or credit cards, mobile devices or medical insurance cards under Hangzhou and Zhejiang’s medical insurance programs. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 18% of our pharmacy revenue came from cash sales, 44% from Hangzhou’s medical insurance cards (where most of our pharmacies are located), and 38% from debit and credit cards, Zhejiang’s medical insurance cards, Alipay and other charge cards.
 
We maintain strict cash control procedures at our pharmacies. Our integrated information management system records the details of each sale, which we control from our headquarters. Depending on each location’s sales activities, cash may be deposited daily or several times per week in designated bank accounts.
 
For sales made to eligible participants in the national medical insurance program, we generally obtain payments from the relevant government social security bureaus on a monthly basis. See “Relevant PRC Regulations - Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program.” According to relevant regulations, a drugstore usually needs to operate for at least one (1) year before it can apply to be licensed to accept Hangzhou’s medical insurance cards. As of the date of this report, ninety six (96) of our one hundred and nine (109) “Jiuzhou Grand Pharmacy” stores are licensed to accept medical insurance cards. Those of our stores that accept medical insurance cards are designated as such by clear signage on their storefront windows.
 
Online Sales Customers
 
Our online customers consist primarily of consumers between the ages of 20 and 40. While our website is accessible throughout China, approximately thirty percent (30%) of our online sales during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, were from Zhejiang and neighboring Jiangsu and Shanghai.
