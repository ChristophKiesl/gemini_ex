Our mission is to “enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere,” and our global structure is designed to help individuals and organizations achieve sustained superior performance through changes in human behavior. From the foundational work of Dr. Stephen R. Covey in leadership and personal effectiveness, and Hyrum W. Smith in productivity and time management, we have developed deep expertise that extends to helping organizations and individuals achieve desired results through lasting behavioral change. We believe that our clients are able to utilize our content and offerings to create cultures which include high-performing, collaborative individuals, led by effective, trust building leaders who execute with excellence and deliver measurably improved results for all of their key stakeholders.

Franklin Covey Services and Offerings

We operate globally with one common brand and a business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service. To achieve this high level of service we have sales and support associates in various locations around the United States and Canada, and operate wholly owned subsidiaries in Australia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. In foreign locations where we do not have a directly owned office, we may contract with independent licensee partners who deliver our content and provide services in 150 other countries and territories around the world.

Our mission is to enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere, and we believe that we are experts at solving certain pervasive, intractable problems, each of which requires a change in human behavior. We seek to consistently deliver world-class content with the broadest and deepest distribution capabilities through the most flexible content delivery modalities. We believe these characteristics distinguish us from our competitors as follows:

1.World Class Content – Our content is based on timeless principles of human effectiveness and is designed to help people change both their mindset and behavior. When our content is applied consistently in an organization, we believe the culture of that organization will change to enable the organization to get results and achieve its own great purposes.

2.Breadth and Scalability of Delivery Options – We have a wide range of content delivery options, from digital to live, including: The All Access Pass and Leader in Me membership, other intellectual property licensing arrangements, live on-line presentations, on-site training, training led through certified facilitators, blended learning, and organization-wide transformational processes, including consulting and coaching services.

3.Global Capability – We not only operate domestically with sales personnel in the United States and Canada, but we also deliver content through our directly owned international offices and independently owned international licensees who deliver our content in countries not covered by a directly owned office. This capability allows us to deliver content to a wide range of customers, from large multinational corporations to smaller local entities.

Our content and offerings are designed to transform organizations by building leaders, teams, and cultures that get results. We believe our content changes behavior, both individually and collectively, in ways that have a dramatic impact on an organization to help solve its most pressing problems and achieve breakthrough results. Further information about our content and services can be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com. However, the information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute any part of this Annual Report.

Business Development

Our business is currently structured around two divisions, the Enterprise Division and the Education Division. The Enterprise Division consists of our Direct Office and International Licensee segments and is focused on selling our offerings to corporations, governments, not-for-profits, and other related organizations. Franklin Covey offerings delivered through the Enterprise Division are designed to help organizations and individuals achieve their own great purposes. Our Education Division is centered around the principles found in the Leader in Me and is dedicated to helping educational institutions build cultures that will produce great results, including increased student performance, improved school culture, and increased parental and teacher involvement.

During 2016, we introduced the All Access Pass (the All Access Pass or AAP), which we believe is a ground-breaking subscription service that allows our clients unlimited access to our content through a digital portal. We believe the AAP is a revolutionary and innovative way to deliver our content to clients of various sizes, including large, multinational organizations, in a flexible and cost-effective manner. Clients may utilize complete offerings such as The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity, or use individual concepts from any of our well-known offerings to create a custom solution to fit their organizational or individual training needs. Since the introduction of the All Access Pass, we have invested in additional implementation specialists to provide our clients with the direction necessary to 

 


create meaningful impact journeys using our tools and content. An impact journey is a customized plan to utilize the content and offerings on the AAP to achieve a client’s specific goals and to provide them with the keys to obtain maximum value from the pass. We have also translated All Access Pass materials into numerous additional languages, which allows the AAP to be used effectively by multinational entities and provides for greater international sales opportunities. The AAP is primarily sold through our Enterprise Division.

In our Education Division, we have launched the Leader in Me membership, which provides access to the Leader in Me online service, and authorizes use of Franklin Covey’s proprietary intellectual property. The Leader in Me online service provides access to digital versions of student leadership guides, leadership lessons, illustrated leadership stories, and a variety of other resources to enable an educational institution to effectively implement and utilize the Leader in Me program. We believe that the tools and resources available through the Leader in Me membership will provide measurable results that are designed to develop student leadership, improve school culture, and increase academic proficiency.

We believe that continued investments in personnel, content, and technological innovation are key to subscription service renewals and the future growth of our offerings.

In addition to the internal development of our offerings, we have sought to grow our sales through acquisitions of businesses and content licenses, and opening new international offices. Over previous years, these activities have included the following:

Acquisition of Strive Talent, Inc. – In April 2021 we purchased Strive Talent, Inc. (Strive), a San Francisco-based technology company which has developed and markets an innovative learning deployment platform. The Strive platform is expected to enable the seamless integration and deployment of our content, services, technology, and metrics to deliver behavioral impact at scale, primarily through the Company’s All Access Pass subscription. We are excited to roll out the new capabilities of the Strive platform in fiscal 2022 and believe the platform will provide significant additional value to our clients and appeal to potential new clients.

License of “Multipliers” Leadership Content – During late fiscal 2019, we obtained a license to develop and sell leadership offerings based on the bestselling book Multipliers by Liz Wiseman. We launched the new programs based on Multipliers content in August 2020. The initial term of this license will expire on August 31, 2029.

Our Associates

We have approximately 1,000 associates worldwide, who are mostly full-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. None of our associates are represented by a union or collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a material labor interruption due to labor disagreements. For more information regarding our associates refer to the Human Capital Resources disclosures found later in this section.
Our Industry and Clients

According to the Training magazine 2021 Training Industry Survey, the total size of the U.S. training industry is expected to increase 12 percent over 2020 and is estimated to be $92.3 billion. The training industry is highly fragmented and includes a wide variety of training and service providers of varying sizes. We believe our competitive advantages in this industry stem from our fully integrated principle-centered training offerings, our wide variety of delivery options, and various implementation tools to help organizations and individuals measurably improve their effectiveness.

We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of organizations of assorted sizes that offer services comparable with ours. Based upon our annual sales, we believe that we are a significant competitor in the performance skills and education market. Other significant comparative companies that compete with our Enterprise Division include: LinkedIn Learning, Development Dimension International, GP Strategies Corp., SkillSoft, Coursera, Udemy Business, Harvard Business Publishing, Cornerstone, Workboard, and Korn Ferry, 

 


among others. Our Education Division competes with entities such as: Character Counts, Responsive Classroom, 7 Mindsets, Second Step, and K12.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the industry in which we compete include the following:

Quality of offerings, services, and solutions
Skills and capabilities of people
Innovative training and consulting services combined with effective products
Ability to add value to client operations
Reputation and client references
Pricing
Global reach and scale
Branding and name recognition in our marketplace

Given the relative ease of entry into the training market, the number of our competitors could increase, many of whom may imitate existing methods of distribution, or could offer similar content and programs at lower prices. However, we believe that we have several areas of competitive differentiation in our industry. We believe that our competitive advantages include: (1) the quality of our content; (2) the breadth of our delivery options, including the AAP and Leader in Me membership; (3) our global reach, which allows truly multinational clients to scale our content uniformly across the globe; and (4) the significant impact which our offerings can have on our clients’ organization and results.

We have a relatively broad base of clients, which includes thousands of organizational, governmental, educational, and individual clients in both the United States and in other countries that are served through our directly owned operations. We have thousands of additional organizational clients throughout the world which are served through our global licensee partner network, and we believe that our content, in all its forms, delivers results that encourage strong client loyalty. Our clients are in a broad array of industries and we are not dependent on a single client or industry group. During the periods presented in this report, none of our clients were responsible for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues.

Our Intellectual Property

Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary content, methodologies, and other intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, copyrights, and confidentiality agreements. We claim rights for over 650 trademarks in the United States and foreign countries, and we have obtained registration in the United States and numerous foreign countries for many of our trademarks including FranklinCovey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, The 4 Disciplines of Execution, and The 7 Habits. We consider our trademarks and other proprietary rights to be important and material to our business.

We claim nearly 230 registered copyrights, and own sole or joint copyrights on our books, manuals, text and other printed information provided in our training programs, and other electronic media products, including audio and video media. We may license, rather than sell, facilitator workbooks and other seminar and training materials in order to protect our intellectual property rights therein. We place trademark and copyright notices on our instructional, marketing, and advertising materials. In order to maintain the proprietary nature of our product information, we enter into written confidentiality agreements with certain executives, product developers, sales professionals, training consultants, other employees, and licensees.

Our Products and Sustainability

We offer training materials and related accessories in either digital or paper formats. Our printed training materials are primarily comprised of paper, which we believe is a renewable and sustainable resource. We purchase our training materials and related products from various vendors and suppliers located both domestically and internationally, and we are not dependent upon any one vendor for the production of our training and related materials as the raw materials for 

 


these products are readily available. Our training materials are primarily warehoused and distributed from an independent warehouse facility located in Des Moines, Iowa.

Seasonality

Our fourth quarter of each fiscal year typically has higher sales and operating income than other fiscal quarters primarily due to increased revenues in our Education Division (when school administrators and faculty have professional development days) and to increased sales that typically occur during that quarter from year-end incentive programs. Overall, training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training, which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and certain vacation periods.
Human Capital Resources

Culture and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) at Franklin Covey

Our mission is to enable greatness in people and organizations everywhere. To fulfill that mission and successfully implement our strategy, we must attract, develop, and retain highly qualified associates for each role in the organization. We currently have approximately 1,000 associates around the world, who are dedicated to providing the best service possible for our clients. Our goal is to have every associate feel they are a valued member of a winning team doing meaningful work in an environment of trust. To accomplish this goal, we are focused on attracting, developing, and retaining talent while looking through the lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion in each area. 

In January 2021, we established the new position of Director of Learning, Development, and Inclusion. This position is responsible for the internal learning and development our associates in ways that align with our strategic plans for growth. In addition, we established the Franklin Covey Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council, which is comprised of approximately 35 associates from across our organization who are tasked with monitoring and implementing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at all levels within the Company. Franklin Covey also sponsors an increasing number of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are groups of employees who come together based on a shared interest in a specific dimension of diversity. Our global ERG network spans varying dimensions of diversity and is open to all associates. These ERGs are a cornerstone of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. We believe our ERGs represent and support our diverse workforce, facilitate networking and connections with peers, and create a culture of inclusion and engagement within the organization.

We believe the diverse and global makeup of our workforce allows us to successfully serve a variety of clients with different needs on a worldwide basis.

Attracting Talent

We have historically attracted “mission driven” people who care deeply about making a difference in the world. Our recruiting and hiring efforts cast a wide net when looking for candidates by partnering with many groups and agencies, including alumni organizations, multiple diversity job boards, diversity career fairs, the Utah Governor’s Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities and Business Relations, and ElevatHER – an organization designed to promote women in leadership. We established a new Manager of Diversity Partnerships position during fiscal 2021 to better evaluate our relationships with organizations that supply and impact our talent pool and to engage in targeted outreach to further diversify our recruiting network. Furthermore, our job descriptions contain clearly outlined skills and experience necessary for success in each role. We believe these descriptions are essential to effectively interview candidates for identifiable skillsets and not just “personality fits.” Through these efforts, from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021, 67 percent of our new hires were women. Currently, over 66 percent of our employee population are women.

We also remain steadfast in our commitment to recruiting and developing Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) associates. From June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021, 37 percent of our new hires were BIPOC associates. In an effort to increase the population of BIPOC associates, we have expanded our recruitment efforts. We hope to increase 

 


the number of BIPOC applicants to ensure we are hiring the most qualified people while increasing our diversity. We are also actively engaged in ensuring that our associate promotions are fair and equitable.

Developing Talent

We believe that creating an environment which encourages life-long learning and development is essential for us to maintain a high level of service and to achieve our goal to have every associate feel they are a valued member of a winning team doing meaningful work in an environment of trust. Franklin Covey is one of the premier training and consulting organizations in the world, and we develop and deliver various offerings, including leadership and individual effectiveness, to clients around the globe. We provide these same offerings to our associates. Our associates have unlimited access to our content and training through the All Access Pass, where they are able to experience the same high-quality solutions available to our clients. During associates’ first year, we encourage them to participate in our foundational offering, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, which is the cultural operating system for our organization. During fiscal 2021, we delivered our new Unconscious Bias training to our associates. This program is designed to strengthen organizations by promoting the inclusion of various viewpoints from the natural talents and abilities of its people regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, religion, or other differences.

In the event an associate is struggling with reaching their goals or producing the results required of the role, a thoughtful and thorough performance plan is created and implemented by the associate’s manager and our Chief People Officer. The intent of the performance plan is to help the associate recalibrate and bring performance up to expectations. Through this transparent coaching process, struggling associates are able to learn how to improve their performance and become engaged, successful contributors in their role. We believe this process strengthens our associate base while reducing the cost of finding and training new associates.

Through our ongoing associate development efforts, from June 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021, over 79 percent of our promotions awarded were to women and more than 11 percent of promotions were awarded to BIPOC associates. As of June 1, 2021, 47 percent of all Vice Presidents within Franklin Covey are women.

Retaining Talent

The war for talent is real, and talented people are always in high demand. During the period of June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021, our associate turnover rate in the United States and Canada was 12 percent, which we believe is reasonable for our industry and the make-up of our workforce.

To retain our associates, we believe it is critical to continually focus on making sure our associates are highly engaged and feel valued. We address these retention efforts in a number of ways, including training our leaders in our solution entitled, The 6 Critical Practices for Leading a Team. Our employee retention practices include holding consistent, effective one-on-one interviews, where leaders regularly take time to connect with their associates, and to understand what is working well for them and what is not. Based on these interviews, leaders are encouraged to “clear the path” of those things which may be holding the associate back. We are also focused on creating a culture of feedback, where feedback for both leaders and associates is a normal and helpful part of how work gets done. We believe that open dialogue and feedback is so important that in 2021 we established Contribution Conversations, a formal program consisting of one-on-one conversations where associates are provided the opportunity to express how their talents and interests can best serve themselves and the organization. Contribution Conversations align to our core value to focus on the whole person and allow our associates to find their voice. We believe these efforts are key to creating an atmosphere of continuous improvement.

Our compensation plans are audited periodically to confirm ongoing pay equity. We provide a generous personal time off benefit as well as a flexible and inclusive holiday schedule, reflecting the diversity of our workforce and the celebration of various cultural and religious affiliations. We also offer 100 percent salary continuance for up to 12 weeks in a rolling 12-month period, for qualifying medical leaves, and provide many other employee minded benefits.





Our focus on human capital has been a hallmark of Franklin Covey for decades, understanding that people truly are a company’s most valuable asset, and that culture is an organization’s ultimate competitive advantage. In 2017, our Organization and Compensation Committee determined to make Talent Stewardship a standing agenda item at committee meetings, and we recently included diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts as an additional standing agenda item. The Organization and Compensation Committee is actively involved in helping to determine best practices and implement new and innovative ways to help us continually improve in attracting, developing, and retaining top talent for Franklin Covey.

Our Response to COVID-19

Franklin Covey cares about the health and safety of its associates. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly and effectively transitioned more than 90 percent of our associates to remote work and worked diligently to adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health professional guidance to ensure that we implemented best practices to protect the safety of colleagues while continuing to serve clients, partners, and other stakeholders. We believe these actions have been effective during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
