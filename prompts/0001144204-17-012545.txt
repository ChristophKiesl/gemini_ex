Overview
 
We are a late-stage clinical company focused on developing therapeutics designed to preserve the microbiome to protect and restore the health of patients. Our lead candidates poised for Phase 3 development are: (1) SYN-010 which is intended to reduce the impact of methane-producing organisms in the gut microbiome to treat an underlying cause of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C), and (2) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to protect the gut microbiome from the effects of certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics for the prevention of C. difficile infection (CDI), antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We are also developing preclinical stage monoclonal antibody therapies for the prevention and treatment of pertussis, and novel discovery stage biotherapeutics for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU).

All of our programs are supported by our growing intellectual property portfolio. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. In total, we hold approximately 140 U.S. and foreign patents and have over 55 U.S. and foreign patents pending.
 
Our Microbiome-Focused Pipeline
 
Our IBS-C and CDI/AAD programs are focused on protecting the healthy function of the gut microbiome, or gut flora, which is home to billions of microbial species and composed of a natural balance of both “good” beneficial species and potentially “bad” pathogenic species. When the natural balance or normal function of these microbial species is disrupted, a person’s health can be compromised.
SYN-010 — Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)
 
SYN-010 is our proprietary, modified-release formulation of lovastatin lactone that is intended to reduce methane production by certain microorganisms ( M. smithii ) in the gut while minimizing disruption to the microbiome. Methane produced by M. smithii is an underlying cause of pain, bloating and constipation associated with IBS-C, and published reports have associated higher intestinal methane production with increased constipation severity in IBS-C patients. SYN-010 is intended to act primarily in the intestinal lumen while avoiding systemic absorption, thereby targeting the major cause of IBS-C, not just the patient’s symptoms.

In December 2013, through our subsidiary Synthetic Biomics, Inc. (SYN Biomics), we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) and acquired the rights to develop products for therapeutic and prophylactic treatments of acute and chronic diseases, including the development of SYN-010 to target IBS-C. We licensed from CSMC a portfolio of intellectual property comprised of several U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications for various fields of use, including IBS-C, obesity and diabetes. An investigational team led by Mark Pimentel, M.D. at CSMC discovered that these products may reduce the production of methane gas by certain GI microorganisms.
 
We believe SYN-010 may reduce the impact of methane producing organisms on IBS-C.
 
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
 
IBS is a functional GI disorder characterized by gas, abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhea or constipation, or alternating episodes of both. The illness affects both men and women; however, two-thirds of diagnosed sufferers are women. The onset of IBS can begin anytime from adolescence to adulthood. Four bowel patterns may be seen with IBS including: IBS-C (constipation predominant), IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-M (mixed diarrhea and constipation) and IBS-U (unsubtyped). According to GlobalData’s IBS — Global Drug Forecast and Market Analysis to 2023 (December 2014 ) stringent disease diagnosis criteria to ensure market relevance and a population most likely to receive a diagnosis and prescription drug treatment, the prevalence of IBS in adults in the United States, Europe and Japan was expected to be 41.1 million in 2016, and it has been reported that up to 20 percent of all IBS patients have IBS-C Extensive studies conducted by Dr. Pimentel and collaborators have shown that overproduction of methane gas is directly associated with bloating, pain and constipation in IBS-C patients. Investigators at CSMC have discovered that inhibiting intestinal methane production may reverse constipation associated with IBS-C, and may be beneficial in treating other major diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
Limitations of Current Treatments and Market Opportunity
 
Currently, the FDA approved therapies for the treatment of IBS-C and other treatments include prescription and over-the-counter laxatives, which provide patients with temporary symptomatic relief and often cause diarrhea, but do not treat the underlying cause of pain, bloating and constipation associated with IBS-C. According to GlobalData, IBS — Global Drug Forecast and Market Analysis to 2023 (December 2014), the estimated global sales for IBS therapeutics for 2016 was $669.3 million, and global sales are expected to be greater than $1.5 billion in 2023.
Overview of our 2 Phase 2 Clinical Trials
 
In 2015 and 2016, we reported supportive data from our two SYN-010 Phase 2 trials, the first study was comprised of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study comparing SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg dose strengths to placebo (Study 1), followed by an open-label study in which eligible patients who completed Study 1 received SYN-010 42 mg for an additional 8 weeks (Study 2). The two Phase 2 SYN-010 clinical trials evaluated the change from baseline (Day 1 of Study 1) in breath methane, stool frequency and abdominal pain and bloating at the end of weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12 (Study 2 – Day 84) in patients diagnosed with IBS-C and with breath methane levels greater than 10 parts per million (ppm) at screening.
First Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results (4 Week Placebo-Controlled Acute Study)
 
In December 2015, we reported supportive topline results from our first Phase 2 placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of SYN-010, including lowered breath methane and improved stool frequency in patients with IBS-C. This first Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in June 2015 and enrolled 63 patients who were randomized using a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups, including two different SYN-010 dose groups (21 mg and 42 mg) and a placebo group. Patients received single oral doses of SYN-010 or a placebo each day for 28 days. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the change from baseline in the area under the curve (AUC) of breath methane, as determined by a lactulose breath test, in methane-positive patients with IBS-C after seven days of treatment with one of two dose levels of SYN-010 as compared with a placebo. The trial’s secondary endpoints included improvement in the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week, and improvement in abdominal pain and bloating per standard scales required per FDA guidance. There were no serious adverse events observed.
 
In the first Phase 2 clinical trial of SYN-010, plasma trough levels of lovastatin species were low and variable, such that ≥50% of patients had undetectable plasma levels of each lovastatin analyte at days 7 and 28. In the few patients with detectable trough levels at day 28, concentrations of both lovastatin lactone and lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid were significantly lower than those reported in published studies of commercial lovastatin formulations. Modest reductions from baseline in mean cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides were observed after 7 days of SYN-010 treatment; however, changes were not different between SYN-010 and Placebo at Day 28 and were not evident after 12 weeks (Day 84). No significant changes in mean ALT or creatine kinase were observed in these patients. Changes in cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides did not correlate with SYN-010 dose, or with changes in body weight, changes in breath methane, or plasma trough levels of either lovastatin lactone or lovastatin β-hydroxyacid.

Second Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results (8 Week Open-Label Extension Study)
 
In January 2016, we reported supportive topline data from our second Phase 2 clinical trial of SYN-010, which was initiated in October 2015. As the patients completed the first Phase 2 clinical trial, they were eligible to immediately rollover into the second Phase 2 clinical trial (multi-center, open-label) of SYN-010 that evaluated the sustainability of the effect of one dose strength of SYN-010 (42 mg) on breath methane production in 54 breath methane-positive patients with IBS-C, as well as key clinical outcomes, including frequency of CSBM, abdominal pain and bloating.
 
Patients in the second Phase 2 clinical trial reported compliance with the daily SYN-010 dosing regimen such that all patients in the second Phase 2 clinical trial received a minimum of 8 weeks treatment with SYN-010 42 mg. Patients who completed the second Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in methane production (p=0.002) from the beginning of the first Phase 2 clinical trial (Baseline, Day 1, prior to any drug administration in the randomized study) to the end of the second Phase 2 clinical trial (12 weeks, Day 84), thus meeting the clinical trial's primary endpoint. Topline data from the second Phase 2 clinical trial also showed improvements in secondary efficacy endpoints, including: (1) a statistically significant reduction in the mean IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS; p<0.0001), which includes abdominal pain, bloating, stool frequency and quality of life scores, for all patients from the first Phase 2 clinical trial baseline to the end of the second Phase 2 clinical trial, and (2) an increase in the percentage of patients identified as Monthly Responders, an FDA-defined composite measure incorporating improvements in CSBMs and abdominal pain.
 
Daily doses of SYN-010 were well-tolerated by IBS-C patients over the combined 12 weeks of the Phase 2a clinical trials (at least 8 weeks of SYN-010 42 mg). No serious adverse events were observed and there were no incidences of drug-related diarrhea.
 
DDW 2016 Presentation
 
In May 2016, we presented detailed data from two Phase 2 clinical trials of two dose strengths of SYN-010 at DDW2016.
 
Clinical data from the 57 patients who completed Study 1 and the 54 patients who completed Study 2 showed clinically meaningful improvements in measurable endpoints, including:
 

· | Data from Study 1 demonstrating that three times as many patients in the placebo group took rescue medication compared to patients on either the 21 mg or 42 mg dose strength of SYN-010. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Data from all patients who participated in both Study 1 and Study 2 and who were administered the 42 mg dose strength of SYN-010 for at least eight weeks demonstrated an inverse correlation (p=0.0259) between breath methane AUC and complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM). A similar inverse correlation (p=0.0028) was observed between breath methane AUC and spontaneous bowel movements (SBM). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Data demonstrating the 42 mg dose strength of SYN-010 had a similar overall drug response rate to comparable FDA approved and clinical stage therapies for the treatment of IBS-C with a significantly lower rate of diarrhea in study participants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Data demonstrating clear improvements in abdominal pain, bloating and quality of life measures (IBS-SSS) in participants who were administered SYN-010. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Pharmacokinetic Study
 
In May 2016, we reported results from a separate completed randomized, open-label clinical study of healthy volunteers which evaluated the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the active ingredient of SYN-010. The PK data in healthy volunteers supported the modified-release profile of SYN-010, which is designed to avoid drug release in the stomach and deliver the antimethanogenic drug form, lovastatin lactone, into the lower small intestine and colon while reducing systemic exposure to the cholesterol-lowering lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid metabolite. Lovastatin lactone concentrations in stool samples from these healthy volunteers were equivalent to concentrations that caused 90% inhibition of methane production by stool samples from IBS-C patients in vitro. Consistent with the Phase 2a studies in IBS-C patients, data reported from this study demonstrated that the administration of SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg did not result in adverse changes to the lipid profiles of study participants.

Phase 3 Planning
 
On July 20, 2016, we participated in an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. Following a review of data from the two Phase 2 clinical trials of SYN-010 conducted by us, a collaborative and positive discussion ensued with the FDA to determine the optimal pathway to advance SYN-010 into Phase 3 development. On January 18, 2017, and in accordance with guidance from the FDA, we confirmed our plan to conduct a Phase 2b/3 adaptive design study for our first pivotal trial of SYN-010 which we plan to initiate during 2017.
 
In accordance with collaborative discussions with the FDA, key components of the SYN-010 Phase 2b/3 adaptive pivotal trial will include:
 

· | A 12-week, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive design clinical trial 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A study population of approximately 840 adult subjects diagnosed with IBS-C 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Evaluation of efficacy and safety of two dose strengths of SYN-010 (21 mg and 42 mg) compared to placebo 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Conducted in approximately 150 clinical sites in North America 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Study subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, receiving either 21 mg of SYN-010, 42 mg of SYN-010, or placebo 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enrollment will be open to all IBS-C patients; breath-methane will be measured at baseline to ensure a comparable ratio of high-to-low breath methane IBS-C patients in each treatment arm 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | An interim futility analysis may be conducted when approximately 50% of patients in each dosing arm have completed treatment 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Consistent with FDA written guidance, the primary objective for this study is to determine the efficacy of SYN-010, measured as an improvement from baseline in the percentage of overall weekly responders1 during the 12-week treatment period for SYN-010 21 mg and 42 mg daily doses compared to placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints for both dose strengths of SYN-010 will measure changes from baseline in abdominal pain, bloating, bowel movement frequency and stool consistency. Exploratory outcomes include adequate relief and quality of life measures using the well-validated EQ-5D-5L and PAC-SYM patient questionnaires.
 
Anticipated Regulatory Strategy
 
We believe that we will be able to utilize the regulatory approval pathway provided in Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) for SYN-010. A New Drug Application (NDA) submitted under Section 505(b)(2), referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, contains full safety and efficacy reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. We believe we can rely in part on the FDA’s previous findings of safety for Mevacor (lovastatin) in published clinical data. We expect to rely on published clinical trials using Mevacor to provide support of efficacy.
Intellectual Property
 
The SYN-010 intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 70 issued U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 20 U.S. and foreign patents pending.
 
SYN-004 (ribaxamase) — Prevention of C. difficile infections (CDI) and antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD)
 
SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is an oral prophylactic therapy designed to degrade certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics within the GI tract and maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI, AAD and emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay in hospital infection management and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics.
 

1 An overall 12-week responder is defined as a subject with a weekly response in at least 50% of the weeks of treatment (6 of 12 weeks). Weekly Responder is defined as a patient who experiences a decrease in weekly average score for worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours of at least 30% compared with Study 1 Baseline and a stool frequency increase of 1 or more CSBM per week compared with Study 1 Baseline.

In November 2012, we acquired a series of oral beta-lactamase enzymes (P1A, P2A and P3A) and related assets targeting the prevention of CDI, the leading healthcare-associated infection that generally occurs secondary to treatment with IV antibiotics from Prev ABR LLC. The acquired assets include a pre-Investigation New Drug (IND) package for P3A (which we now refer to as ribaxamase, formerly SYN-004), Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data for P1A, manufacturing processes and data, and a portfolio of issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents intended to support an IND and Biologics License Application (BLA) with the FDA. Utilizing this portfolio of assets, we developed a proprietary, second generation oral beta-lactamase enzyme product candidate that we call ribaxamase.
 
Compared to the first generation oral enzyme candidate of P1A, we believe that the second generation candidate, SYN-004 (ribaxamase), will have activity against a broader spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics, including both penicillins and certain cephalosporins. Due to the structural similarities between P1A and SYN-004 (ribaxamase), and based on previous discussions with the FDA, certain preclinical data collected on P1A was used in support of an IND application for our new product candidate, SYN-004 (ribaxamase). P1A was evaluated in four Phase 1 and one Phase 2 clinical trials conducted in Europe. In total, 112 patients and 143 healthy normal subjects participated in these studies.
 
Beta-lactamase enzymes have the ability to degrade beta-lactam antibiotics that may be excreted into the Gastro Intestinal tract (GI tract). P1A (the first generation candidate) showed acceptable safety and tolerability in a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, data from two Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrated that P1A had the ability to preserve GI microflora in hospitalized patients treated with IV ampicillin or the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam.
 
C. difficile
 
C. difficile is the leading type of hospital acquired infection and is frequently associated with IV beta-lactam antibiotic treatment. According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leffler DA et al. N Engl J Med 2015; 372: 1539-1548), CDIs more than quadruple the cost of hospitalizations, increasing annual expenditures by approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. CDI is a rising global hospital acquired infection (HAI) problem in which the toxins produced by C. difficile bacteria result in AAD, and in the most serious cases, pseudomembranous colitis (severe inflammation of the lower GI tract) that can lead to death. The CDC identified C. difficile as an “urgent public health threat,” particularly given its resistance to many drugs used to treat other infections. CDI is a major unintended risk associated with the prophylactic or therapeutic use of IV antibiotics, which may alter the natural balance of microflora that normally protect the GI tract, leading to C. difficile overgrowth and infection. Other risk factors for CDI include hospitalization, prolonged length of stay (estimated at 4-7 days), underlying illness, and immune-compromising conditions including the administration of chemotherapy and advanced age. In addition, approximately 25% of patients who have been diagnosed with CDI experience a recurrence of CDI within one to three months.
 
Limitations of Current Treatments and Market Opportunity
 
CDI is a widespread and often drug resistant infectious disease. According to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leffler DA et al. N Engl J Med 2015; 372:1539-1548), it is estimated that 453,000 patients are infected with C. difficile annually in the U.S., and it has been reported that approximately 29,000 patients die due to a CDI each year. CDI has surpassed methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as the most frequent hospital acquired infection. Controlling the spread of CDI has proven challenging, as the C. difficile spores are easily transferred to patients via normal contact with healthcare personnel and with inanimate objects. There is currently no vaccine or approved product for the prevention of CDI.
 
According to IMS Health Incorporated, each year 24 million unique patients are administered some form of IV antibiotic in the U.S. which may contribute to the onset of CDI*. Additional data that we requisitioned suggests SYN-004’s (ribaxamase’s) significant target market is represented by the 117 million average days SYN-004 (ribaxamase) could be administered with target IV beta-lactam antibiotics to the 16.7 million hospitalized patients each year, which at a price point of $100 per day indicates a potential market size of approximately $12.0 billion. This estimate is based upon data that we requisitioned and derived from the following report: Arlington Medical Resources (AMR), a Decision Resources Group Company, 2014 Audits of Acute Care Hospital Antibiotic Utilization. Currently there are no approved treatments designed to protect the gut microbiome from the damaging effects of IV antibiotics. We believe SYN-004’s ability to degrade certain beta-lactam antibiotics will be consistent with, or more effective than results previously demonstrated by PIA, SYN-004’s predecessor, in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies conducted by IPSAT. In previously reported clinical studies, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) demonstrated greater efficacy in degrading certain cephalosporins (ceftriaxone) compared to its predecessor, PIA. The worldwide market for SYN-004 (ribaxamase) could represent a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us.

Phase 1a and 1b Clinical Trial Pharmacokinetic Data
 
In March 2015, we reported supportive pharmacokinetic data from our Phase 1a and 1b clinical trials, which suggests that SYN-004 (ribaxamase) may have no effect on the IV antibiotic in the bloodstream, allowing the antibiotic to fight the primary infection. In February 2015, we reported supportive topline results from our Phase 1b clinical trial of escalating doses of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase), with no safety or tolerability issues reported at dose levels and dose regimens both meeting and exceeding those expected to be studied in upcoming clinical trials. The Phase 1a (40 participants) and 1b (24 participants) clinical trials of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) were initiated in December 2014.
First Phase 2a Clinical Trial Topline Results
 
In December 2015, we reported supportive topline results from our Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), including data from ten ileostomized participants that demonstrated SYN-004 (ribaxamase) successfully degraded residual IV ceftriaxone in the chyme (digestive fluid in the small intestine) without affecting the intended level of ceftriaxone in the bloodstream. This Phase 2a clinical trial was initiated in March 2015 to evaluate the GI antibiotic-degrading effects and the safety of SYN-004 (ribaxamase).
Second Phase 2a Clinical Trial Topline Results
 
In June 2015, we initiated a second Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to evaluate the GI antibiotic-degrading ability and the safety of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), in the presence of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI), esomeprazole, in healthy participants with functioning ileostomies.
 
In May 2016, we reported supportive topline results from our second Phase 2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), including data demonstrating the 150 mg dose of SYN-004 (ribaxamase), both alone and in the presence of the proton pump inhibiter (PPI), esomeprazole, degraded residual IV ceftriaxone to levels that were low or not detectable in the intestinal chyme (digestive fluid in the small intestine) of 14 healthy participants with functioning ileostomies. In addition, ceftriaxone plasma concentrations in study participants were very similar in the presence or absence of an oral PPI, suggesting limited drug-drug interactions with esomeprazole. The 150 mg dose strength of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) was well tolerated by all participants in this clinical trial.
 
Additional Studies
 
Data from an additional study conducted in humanized pigs demonstrated that when administered with ceftriaxone, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) prevented ceftriaxone-remediated changes in the pig fecal microflora, protecting the microbiome from antibiotic-mediated damage when compared to pigs who only received ceftriaxone.
CDC’s Broad Agency Announcement
 
On October 6, 2016, we announced the award of a government contract by the CDC’s Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 2016-N-17812. The contract amount is up to $521,014. The award will support research conducted during our ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical study of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and the CDCs’ efforts to assess how selective pressure from IV antibiotics may lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the gut microbiome. The funding will also support research to evaluate SYN-004’s (ribaxamase's) ability to reduce selective pressure associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in the gut microbiomes of patients enrolled in our Phase 2b clinical trial. We will examine DNA isolated from longitudinal samples obtained during the clinical trial and look for changes to the patient's gut resistome, specifically examining for alterations in the presence and/or abundance of antibiotic resistance genes.
Phase 2b Clinical Trial Design & Topline Results / Phase 3 Planning
 
In September 2015, we initiated a randomized placebo-controlled Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial intended to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to prevent CDI, C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and AAD in patients hospitalized for a lower respiratory tract infection and receiving IV ceftriaxone. A planned interim analysis was triggered and conducted following the enrollment of approximately 80% of the planned patients who also completed the follow-up period outlined in the study protocol.  In September 2016, and following a closed session with the independent Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) in which we remained blinded to the study data, a recommendation was given by the IAC to continue the study per protocol without modification, indicating that the study was adequately powered and should continue as planned. No safety issues were identified by the IAC during the interim analysis. Based upon the recommendation by the IAC, we completed enrollment in this trial in September 2016 with 413 patients exceeding the desired sample size of 372 patients. Analysis of an exploratory endpoint from this trial designed to evaluate the ability of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) to limit disruption of the gut microbiome diversity, also known as dysbiosis, is ongoing.

On January 5, 2017, we announced positive topline data from our Phase 2b clinical trial demonstrating SYN-004 (ribaxamase) achieved its primary endpoint of significantly reducing CDI. Preliminary analysis of the data indicated seven confirmed cases of CDI in the placebo group compared to two cases in the ribaxamase treatment group. Patients receiving ribaxamase achieved a 71.4% relative risk reduction (p-value=0.045) in CDI rates compared to patients receiving placebo. Adverse events reported during this trial were comparable between treatment and placebo arms.
 
Preliminary analysis of the data demonstrated a significant reduction in new colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) for patients receiving ribaxamase compared to placebo (p-value=0.0002). With agreement from the FDA, the study included a secondary endpoint to assess ribaxamase’s capacity to decrease the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea from all causes. Preliminary analysis of the data suggested a trend towards such a reduction (p-value=0.13), which was due, for the most part, to the reduction of CDI.
 
We are in the process of further analyzing data from this clinical trial and expect to share additional results from additional exploratory endpoints as they become available later this year, including results focused on ribaxamase’s ability to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the gut microbiome.
 
In 2017, we also plan to enter into strategic discussions with the CDC, hold an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, and expect to initiate Phase 3 trial(s) towards the first half of 2018 or later.
 
SYN-007 — Prevention of CDI and AAD
 
Preclinical work is ongoing to determine the ability of SYN-007 to degrade oral beta-lactam antibiotics and protect the gut microbiome. SYN-007 comprises a reformulated version of SYN-004 for use with oral beta-lactam antibiotics versus IV beta-lactam antibiotics.


SYN-006 — Prevention of CDI and AAD
 
The development of SYN-006 is in the discovery stage. SYN-006 is intended to be an oral prophylactic therapy designed to degrade IV carbapenem antibiotics (a third class of beta-lactam antibiotics) within the GI tract and maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome for the prevention of CDI and AAD. While SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is intended to degrade penicillin and certain cephalosporins in the GI tract, the SYN-006 discovery program has the potential to expand the activity to a broader spectrum of IV beta-lactam antibiotics in the GI tract to include carbapenem antibiotics.
 
C. difficile: Intellectual Property
 
The SYN-004 (ribaxamase) intellectual property portfolio includes approximately 60 issued U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 35 U.S. and foreign patents pending.
 
Research Programs
 
Infectious disease outbreaks are increasing while intervention options are declining due to widespread multidrug-resistant bacteria, increasing numbers of immuno-compromised patients (e.g., the elderly and cancer patients) and the isolation of new pathogens.

SYN-005 — Pertussis (Whooping Cough)
 
Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) is a gram-negative bacterium that infects the upper respiratory tract, causing uncontrollable and violent coughing. Antibiotic treatment does not have a major effect on the course of pertussis. While such treatment can eliminate the B. pertussis bacteria from the respiratory tract, it does not neutralize the pertussis toxin. Infants with pertussis often require hospitalization in pediatric intensive care units, frequently requiring mechanical ventilation. The incidence of pertussis is increasing due to the declining effectiveness of the acellular vaccine introduced in the 1990s, exposure of unvaccinated and under-vaccinated individuals including infants who are not yet fully vaccinated and exposure of individuals whose immunity has diminished over time.
 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 50 million cases of whooping cough, and it is estimated that B. pertussis infection causes up to 300,000 deaths each year worldwide, primarily among unvaccinated infants.
 
Intrexon Collaboration and The University of Texas at Austin Agreement
 
In August 2012, we entered into a worldwide exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon through which we intend to develop monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies for the treatment of certain infectious diseases not adequately addressed by existing therapies. In December 2012, we initiated mAb development for the prevention and treatment of pertussis focusing on toxin neutralization. Unlike antibiotics, we are developing a mAb therapy to target and neutralize the pertussis toxin as a prophylaxis for high-risk newborns and in order to reduce the mortality rate in infected infants.
 
To further the development of this potential therapy for pertussis, we entered into an agreement with UT Austin to license the rights to certain research and pending patents related to pertussis antibodies. These research efforts are being conducted at the Cockrell School of Engineering in the laboratory of Associate Professor, Jennifer A. Maynard, Ph.D., the Laurence E. McMakin, Jr. Centennial Faculty Fellow in the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering. Dr. Maynard brings to the project her expertise in defining the key neutralizing epitopes of pertussis toxin to optimize the potential efficacy of antibody therapeutics.


Preclinical Development

Working with our collaborator, Intrexon, and our academic collaborator, UT Austin, we have established a humanized mAb product candidate, SYN-005, designed to neutralize pertussis toxin, a major cause of pertussis-mediated infant morbidity and mortality. The two humanized mAbs, hu1B7 and hu11E6, bound tightly to the toxin and potently neutralized the toxin. In addition, the antibodies, individually or in combination, were highly efficacious in a murine model of pertussis in which they completely mitigated elevations of the white blood cell count that is characteristic of the illness.
 
In April 2014, and again in September 2014, we received positive preclinical research findings of SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis in three non-human primate studies (n = 19). In the latter two pertussis studies in particular, SYN-005 rapidly stopped the rise in white blood cell count that is characteristic of the disease and accelerated its return to baseline.
 
In September 2014, we received U.S. Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for SYN-005 for the treatment of pertussis.
 
In April 2015, preclinical efficacy data that support advancing SYN-005 toward clinical trials were presented in two poster presentations at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases meeting (ECCMID) 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The data suggest that SYN-005 has therapeutic potential to diminish morbidity, long-term complications and mortality from pertussis in critically ill infants. In addition, the data support a prophylactic approach for use in newborns that has the potential to save thousands of lives annually, particularly in the developing world where the unmet need is greatest.
 
In October 2015, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a grant to UT Austin to generate preclinical proof-of-concept data in the neonatal non-human primate model to test the hypothesis that antibody administration at birth may have a role in the prevention of pertussis.
 
In December 2015, the non-human primate prophylaxis study was initiated by UT Austin to evaluate the potential of our monoclonal antibody, 1B7, for the prevention of pertussis. This preclinical study is expected to provide support for the potential clinical application of 1B7.

Intellectual Property
 
We have three issued U.S. patents and ten patents pending on compositions and uses of SYN-005 and other pertussis mAbs from UT Austin.
 
SYN-200 — Treatment of Phenylketonuria (PKU)
 
PKU is a genetic disease that begins at birth characterized by a deficiency in the liver enzyme that breaks down the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), a building block of proteins normally obtained through the foods we eat. As a result, Phe accumulates in the body, becoming toxic and leading to serious health consequences, including profound mental retardation, brain damage, mental illness, behavioral problems, seizures, tremors, limited cognitive ability and hyperactivity. If left untreated, the most severe form of PKU leads to permanent cognitive damage. PKU affects more than 14,000 people in the U.S. and 50,000 people in developed nations globally. There is no existing cure for PKU, requiring patients to maintain a life-long treatment program and a carefully controlled diet.
Intrexon Collaboration
 
In August 2015, we initiated the SYN-200 discovery program for development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for the treatment of patients with PKU pursuant to an exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon. We intend to utilize Intrexon’s  ActoBiotics platform to provide a proprietary method of delivering therapeutic protein to the GI tract through food-grade microbes. This program is in the discovery stage.
SYN-020 — Oral Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase
 
SYN-020 is in the preclinical development stage. SYN-020 is being developed as a modified-release oral dosage form of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP). Published preclinical and clinical studies on IAP indicate that an oral IAP product may have efficacy in a broad range of significant therapeutic indications including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, microbial dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome. We have identified cell systems in which IAP can be expressed are generating manufacturing cell lines and processes, and are initiating preclinical animal modeling for multiple novel indications.
Intellectual Property
 
All of our programs are supported by growing patent estates that we either own or exclusively license. Each potential product has issued patents that provide protection. In total, we have approximately 140 U.S. and foreign patents and over 55 U.S. and foreign patents pending. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 8,894,994, which has claims to compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of beta-lactamases, including ribaxamase, carries a patent term to at least 2031. Further, U.S. Patent 9,301,995 and 9,301,996, which, will expire in 2031, cover various uses of beta-lactamases, including ribaxamase, in protecting the microbiome, and allowed U.S. Patent No.s 9,290,754, 9,376,673, 9,404,103 and 9,464,280, which, will expire in 2035, covers further beta-lactamase compositions of matter related to ribaxamase. Also, U.S. Patent No. 9,192,618, which expires in approximately 2023, includes claims that cover use of statins, including SYN-010, for the treatment of IBS-C. U.S. Patent No. 9,289,418, which expires in approximately 2033, includes claims that cover the use of a variety of compounds, including the active agent of SYN-010, to treat constipation in certain screened patients. Pending applications PCT /US2015/045140 and US 14/826,115, cover SYN-010 formulations and, if issued (after nationalization), are expected to have a term to at least 2035.
 
Our goal is to (i) obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods, and other proprietary technologies, ii) preserve our trade secrets, and (iii) operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, worldwide. We seek, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection for product candidates, proprietary information, and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents.
 
Our Collaborations
 
PKU Collaboration with Intrexon Corporation
 
On August 10, 2015, we expanded our relationship with Intrexon and entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (the “PKU ECC”) arrangement in which we intend to use Intrexon’s technology relating to the development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics (a “Collaboration Product”) for the treatment of patients with PKU. On September 2, 2015, in accordance with the terms of the Intrexon Stock Issuance Agreement that we entered into in connection with the Channel Agreement, we paid Intrexon a technology access fee by the issuance of 937,500 shares of common stock, having a value equal to $3 million as of August 7, 2015.

In addition, upon the achievement of certain milestones, we agreed to pay Intrexon milestone payments of up to $27 million for each product developed as follows: (i) $2 million upon first dosing of a patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial upon commencement of an IND, payable in stock or cash at our option; (ii) a payment 30 days after achievement of the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product in the United States or approval of a New Drug Application and/or Biologics License Application for a Collaboration Product by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and (iii) a payment 30 days after achievement of the first commercial sale of a Collaboration Product in a nation subject to the authority of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or approval of a Marketing Authorization Application for a Collaboration Product by the EMA. We will pay Intrexon royalties on annual net sales of Collaboration Products, calculated on a product-by-product basis, equal to a percentage of net sales (ranging from mid-single digits on the first $100 million of net sales to mid-teen digits on net sales in excess of $750 million). We have likewise agreed to pay Intrexon a percentage of quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement. Pursuant to the Second Amendment to Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a “resale” registration statement to register the shares issued under the Intrexon Stock Issuance Agreement, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 15, 2015.
 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center License Agreement
 
On December 5, 2013, through our majority owned subsidiary, SYN Biomics, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement (the “CSMC License Agreement”) for the right to develop, manufacture, use, and sell products for the human and veterinary therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for acute and chronic diseases. An investigational team lead by Dr. Mark Pimentel at CSMC has discovered that these products are intended to target certain pathogenic GI microorganisms that are perceived as an underlying cause of diseases such as IBS-C, obesity and type 2 diabetes. The portfolio of intellectual property licensed to SYN Biomics under the CSMC License Agreement included nine issued U.S. patents, 30 issued patents in various European countries, three issued Australian patents, one Canadian patent and one issued Japanese patent as well as several pending U.S. and international patent applications for most fields of use and modalities (subject to certain agreed-upon exceptions. On December 5, 2013, we also entered into an option agreement regarding IBS with CSMC, which expired unexercised on December 31, 2014.
 
Under the terms of the CSMC License Agreement we issued 334,911 unregistered shares of our common stock to CSMC, as payment of an initial license fee and patent reimbursement fees of $150,000 and $220,000, respectively. The parties also entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with respect to such stock issuance and other issuances of unregistered shares of our common stock that may be issued to CSMC in lieu of cash, including license fees, milestone payments, expense reimbursements and option fees under the CSMC License Agreement. Commencing on the second anniversary of the CSMC License Agreement, SYN Biomics began paying an annual maintenance fee, which payment shall be creditable against annual royalty payments owed under the CSMC License Agreement. In addition to royalty payments which are a percentage of Net Sales (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement) of Licensed Products (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement) and Licensed Technology products (as defined in the CSMC License Agreement), SYN Biomics is obligated to pay CMSC a percentage of any non-royalty sublicense revenues, as well as additional consideration upon the achievement of the following milestones (the first two of which are payable in cash or unregistered shares of our stock at our option): (i) successful Phase 1 trial completion of the first Licensed Product or first Licensed Technology Product; (ii) successful Phase 2 trial completion of the first Licensed Product or first Licensed Technology Product; (iii) initiation of Phase 3 dosing for each additional indication of a Licensed Product or Licensed Technology Product; (iv) successful Phase 3 trial completion for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; (v) the FDA’s acceptance of a New Drug Application for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; (vi) regulatory approval for each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product; and (vii) the first commercial sale of each Licensed Product and each Licensed Technology Product. The stock issuances are subject to prior approval of the NYSE MKT, LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company paid Cedars-Sinai Medical Center $350,000 for milestone payments related this license agreement. There were no milestone payments made during year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Prior to the execution of the CSMC License Agreement, SYN Biomics issued shares of common stock of SYN Biomics to each of CSMC and Dr. Mark Pimentel (the primary inventor of the intellectual property), representing 11.5% and 8.5%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of SYN Biomics (the “SYN Biomics Shares”). The Stock Purchase Agreements for the SYN Biomics Shares provide for certain anti-dilution protection until such time as an aggregate of $3.0 million in proceeds from equity financings are received by SYN Biomics as well as a right, under certain circumstances in the event that the SYN Biomics Shares are not then freely tradeable, and subject to NYSE MKT, LLC approval, as of the 18 and 36 month anniversary date of the effective date of the Stock Purchase Agreements, for each of CSMC and the Dr. Pimentel to exchange up to 50% of their SYN Biomics Shares for unregistered shares of our common stock, with the rate of exchange based upon the relative contribution of the valuation of SYN Biomics to the public market valuation of us at the time of each exchange. The Stock Purchase Agreements also provide for tag-along rights in the event of the sale by us of our shares of SYN Biomics.
 
On August 29, 2015, we, SYN Biomics and Dr. Pimentel entered into the Pimentel Amendment to the Pimentel Stock Purchase Agreement entered into dated December 3, 2013, which accelerated the date upon which Dr. Pimentel can exchange his shares of common stock in SYN Biomics for shares of the our common stock. On August 29, 2015, Dr. Pimentel notified us of his intent to exchange all of the shares of common stock in SYN Biomics owned by him for 1,350,000 shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the Pimentel Stock Purchase Agreement, as amended and the exchange was effectuated on August 31, 2015. We filed a “resale” registration statement to register 200,000 of shares issued to Dr. Pimentel, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 15, 2015.

The CSMC License Agreement terminates: (i) automatically if SYN Biomics enters into a liquidating bankruptcy or other specified bankruptcy event or if the performance of any term, covenant, condition or provision of the CSMC License Agreement will jeopardize the licensure of CMSC, its participation in certain reimbursement programs, its full accreditation by the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or any similar state organizations, its tax exempt status or is deemed illegal; (ii) upon 30 days’ notice from CMSC if SYN Biomics fails to make a payment or use commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights; (iii) upon 60 days’ notice from CMSC if SYN Biomics fails to cure any breach or default of any material obligations under the CSMC License Agreement; or (iv) upon 90 days’ notice from SYN Biomics if CMCS fails to cure any breach or default of any material obligations under the CSMC License Agreement. SYN Biomics also has the right to terminate the License Agreement without cause upon 6 months’ notice to CSMC; however, upon such termination, SYN Biomics is obligated to pay a termination fee with the amount of such fee reduced: (i) if such termination occurs after an IND submission to the FDA but prior to completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial, (ii) reduced further if such termination occurs after completion of Phase 2 clinical trial but prior to completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial; and (iii) reduced to zero if such termination occurs after completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial.
 
The University of Texas at Austin License Agreement and Sponsored Research Agreement
 
On December 19, 2012, we entered into a Patent License Agreement (the “Texas License Agreement”) with The University of Texas at Austin (the “University”) for the exclusive license of the right to use, develop, manufacture, market and commercialize certain research and patents related to pertussis antibodies developed in the lab of Dr. Jennifer A. Maynard, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering. In accordance with the terms of the Texas License Agreement we made the following payments to the University: a payment of past patent expenses, an annual payment of $50,000 per year commencing on the effective date through December 31, 2014 and a $25,000 payment on December 31, 2015. The Texas License Agreement also provides that the University is entitled to milestone payments of $50,000 upon commencement of Phase 1 Clinical Trials, $100,000 upon commencement of Phase 3 Clinical Trials, $250,000 upon NDA submission in the United States, $100,000 upon European Medicines Agency approval and $100,000 upon regulatory approval in an Asian country. In addition, the University is entitled to a running royalty upon Net Product Sales and Net Service Sales (as defined in the Texas License Agreement). The License Agreement terminates upon the expiration of the patent rights (as defined in the Texas License Agreement); provided, however that the Texas License Agreement is subject to early termination by us in our discretion and by the University for a breach of the Texas License Agreement by us.
 
In connection with the Texas License Agreement, we also entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (the “Sponsored Research Agreement”) with the University pursuant to which the University will perform certain research work related to pertussis under the direction of Dr. Jennifer Maynard. All inventions conceived during such research shall be subject to the Texas License Agreement and we will obtain certain rights to patents and technology developed during the course of such research. We paid the University a fixed fee for the first year of $303,287 and the second and third years of $316,438 and $328,758, respectively. The Sponsored Research Agreement was amended on October 22, 2015, to extend its termination date to January 15, 2017 and again on September 2, 2016 to extend the agreement until January 15, 2018; provided, however, the Sponsored Research Agreement is subject to early termination upon the written agreement of the parties, a default in the material obligations under the Sponsored Research Agreement which remain uncured for sixty days after receipt of notice, automatically upon our bankruptcy or insolvency and by us in our sole discretion at any time after the one year anniversary of the date of execution thereof upon no less than 90 days’ notice. Upon a termination after December 31, 2014 or due to a breach by the University, we shall only be responsible for all reasonable expenses that do not exceed the fixed annual amount and that are incurred by the University prior to the termination date for services performed prior to the termination date.
 
We have an issued U.S. patent and patents pending on compositions and uses of SYN-005 that are co-owned UT and ourselves or licensed to us, and we have an issued U.S. patent and patent applications on other pertussis mAbs licensed from UT.
 
Oral Enzyme for C. difficile Program Acquisition Agreement
 
On November 8, 2012, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Prev Agreement”) with Prev ABR LLC (“Prev”), and subsequently closed the transaction on November 28, 2012. Pursuant to the Prev Agreement we acquired the C. difficile program assets of Prev, including pre-IND package for P3A (SYN-004), Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical data for P1A, manufacturing processes and data, and a portfolio of issued and pending U.S. and international patents intended to support an IND and BLA with the FDA. Pursuant to the Prev Agreement, we paid Prev an initial cash payment of $100,000 upon execution of the Prev Agreement and at closing paid an additional cash payment of $135,000 and issued 625,000 unregistered shares of our common stock to Prev. In addition, upon the achievement of the milestones set forth below, Prev may be entitled to receive additional consideration payable 50% in cash and 50% in our stock, subject to Prev’s option to receive the entire payment in shares of our stock: (i) upon commencement of an IND; (ii) upon commencement of a Phase 1 clinical trial; (iii) upon commencement of a Phase 2 clinical trial; (iv) upon commencement of a Phase 3 clinical trial; (v) upon Biologic License Application (BLA) filing in the U.S. and for territories outside of the U.S. (as defined in the Prev Agreement); and (vi) upon BLA approval in the U.S. and upon approval in territories outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, the first three milestones have been met, and at Prev’s option, Prev elected to receive 655,321 shares of the Company’s common stock. The future stock issuances are subject to prior approval of the NYSE MKT, LLC. No royalties are payable to Prev under the Prev Agreement.

Infectious Disease Collaboration with Intrexon Corporation
 
On August 6, 2012, we expanded our relationship with Intrexon and entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration (“ECC”) with Intrexon (the “Infectious Disease ECC”) that governs a “channel collaboration” arrangement in which we intend to use Intrexon’s technology relating to the identification, design and production of human antibodies and DNA vectors for the development and commercialization of a series of monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of pertussis (the “Field’) . Such license is exclusive with respect to any clinical development, selling, offering for sale or other commercialization of our products within the Field (“Synthetic Products”), and otherwise is non-exclusive. We may not sublicense the rights described without Intrexon’s written consent. Under the Infectious Disease ECC, and subject to certain exceptions, we are responsible for, among other things, the performance of the Program including the development, commercialization and manufacturing of products.
 
Subject to certain expense allocations and other offsets provided in the Infectious Disease ECC, we will pay Intrexon royalties on annual net sales of the Synthetic Products, calculated on a Synthetic Product-by-Synthetic Product basis. We have likewise agreed to pay Intrexon a percentage of quarterly revenue obtained from a sublicensor in the event of a sublicensing arrangement.
 
We may voluntarily terminate the Infectious Disease ECC upon 90 days written notice to Intrexon. Intrexon may also terminate the Infectious Disease ECC if we elect not to pursue the development of a Program identified by Intrexon that is a “Superior Therapy” as defined in the Infectious Disease ECC upon 60 days’ notice unless we remedy the circumstances giving rise to the termination during such notice period. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ notice if the other party commits a material breach of the Infectious Disease ECC, subject to certain cure periods.
 
Upon termination of the Infectious Disease ECC, we may continue to develop and commercialize any Synthetic Product that, at the time of termination satisfies one of the following:
 

· | is being commercialized by us; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | has received regulatory approval; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | is a subject of an application for regulatory approval that is pending before the applicable regulatory authority;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | is a subject of at least a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial if such termination is by Intrexon due to a material breach by us of the Infectious Disease ECC or by us upon 60 days’ notice after the first 18 months. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our obligation to pay the royalties described above with respect to these “retained” products will survive termination of the Infectious Disease ECC.
 
On October 16, 2012, we issued 3,552,210 shares of our Common Stock as consideration in connection with the Infectious Disease ECC and the related Stock Issuance Agreement with Intrexon that we entered into on August 6, 2012 (the “Second Stock Issuance Agreement”).
 
We also agreed upon the filing of an IND application with the FDA for a Synthetic Product, or alternatively the filing of the first equivalent regulatory filing with a foreign regulatory agency (both as applicable, the “IND Milestone Event”), to pay Intrexon either (i) $2.0 million in cash, or (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock (the “IND Milestone Shares”) having a fair market value equaling $2.0 million where such fair market value is determined using published market data of the share price for Common Stock at the close of market on the business day immediately preceding the date of public announcement of attainment of the IND Milestone Event.
 
Upon the first to occur of either first commercial sale of a Synthetic Product in a country or the granting of the regulatory approval of that Synthetic Product (both as applicable, the “Approval Milestone Event”), we agreed to pay to Intrexon either (i) $3.0 million in cash, or (ii) that number of shares of Common Stock (the “Approval Milestone Shares”) having a fair market value equaling $3.0 million where such fair market value is determined using published market data of the share price for Common Stock at the close of market on the business day immediately preceding the date of public announcement of attainment of the Approval Milestone Event.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Second Stock Issuance Agreement, and pursuant to the First Amendment to Registration Rights Agreement executed and delivered by the parties at the closing, we filed a “resale” registration statement registering the resale of certain of the shares issued under the Second Stock Issuance Agreement.
 
McLean Hospital Exclusive License Agreement and Meda AB Sublicense Agreement
 
In 2005, as amended in 2007 and 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the McLean Hospital, a Harvard University teaching hospital, relating to U.S. Patent No. 6,610,324 and its foreign equivalents, entitled “Flupirtine in the treatment of fibromyalgia and related conditions.” Effective May 6, 2010, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with Meda AB of Sweden. Pursuant to this agreement, Meda has been granted an exclusive sublicense to all of our patents covering the use of oral flupirtine for fibromyalgia. These patents have been issued in the U.S. and are pending in Canada and Japan. Meda AB informed us that due to the decision of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to limit the use of flupirtine for long-term pill and systemic use, it has postponed its planned fibromyalgia clinical trials in the U.S.

The Regents of University of California License Agreement
 
On February 1, 2016, our subsidiary, Putney Drug, Inc. provided written notice to the Regents that we were terminating our (i) License Agreement and (ii) (collectively, the “CTA”). Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Putney Drug, had licensed from the Regents certain U.S. patents for multiple sclerosis therapy related to our drug candidate Trimesta and Trimesta-combination therapies. Based upon the independent third party analysis of the investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial that evaluated Trimesta as a treatment for RRMS in women, it was determined that the License Agreement and the CTA should be terminated. In accordance with the termination provisions of the License Agreement and the CTA, the terminations were effective May 2, 2016.
Manufacturing
 
Our product candidates are biologics and small molecules that can be readily synthesized by processes that we have developed. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical quantities. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and in most cases only one third-party, to manufacture critical raw materials, drug substance and final drug product for our research, preclinical development and clinical trial activities. Commercial quantities of any drugs we seek to develop will have to be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with the FDA and other regulations, and we plan to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of products we successfully develop.
Research and Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $29.1 million, $32.9 million and $14.5 million, respectively, in research and development expenses.
 
Government Regulation
 
In the U.S., the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, including primarily the FDA. Our proposed activities may also be regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our proposed products may be manufactured, distributed and sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of prescription drugs, such as those that we intend to distribute. FDA regulations require us and our suppliers to meet relevant cGMP regulations for the preparation, packing, labeling, and storage of all drugs.
 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulation, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, submitting periodic reports, drug sampling and distribution requirements, manufacturing or labeling changes, record-keeping requirements, and compliance with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for GMP compliance, imposing procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with these regulations could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, suspension of production or injunctions, seizures, or civil or criminal sanctions. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future subcontractors will be able to comply with these regulations.
 
The FDA regulates prescription drug labeling and promotion activities. The FDA actively enforces regulations prohibiting the marketing of products for unapproved uses. The FDA permits the promotion of drugs for unapproved uses in certain circumstances, subject to stringent requirements. We and our product candidates are subject to a variety of state laws and regulations which may hinder our ability to market our products. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval by foreign regulatory authorities must be obtained prior to commencing clinical trials, and sales and marketing efforts in those countries. These approval procedures vary in complexity from country to country, and the processes may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations now or in the future.
 
The FDA, comparable foreign regulators and state and local pharmacy regulators impose substantial requirements upon clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These and other entities regulate research and development and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our products. The drug approval process required by the FDA under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act generally involves:
 

· | preclinical laboratory and animal tests; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission of an IND, prior to commencing human clinical trials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy for intended use; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Certain preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring them to be replicated. In some cases, long-term preclinical studies are conducted concurrently with clinical studies.
 
We will submit the preclinical test results, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before we begin human clinical trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after filing, unless the FDA raises questions about conduct of the trials outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold, in which case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve the matters before clinical trials can begin. It is possible that our submission may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials must be supervised by qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations, which include informed consent requirements. Each study must be approved and monitored by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) which are periodically informed of the study’s progress, adverse events and changes in research. Annual updates are submitted to the FDA and more frequently if certain serious adverse events occur.
 
Human clinical trials of drug candidates typically have three sequential phases that may overlap:
 
Phase 1:  The drug is initially tested in healthy human subjects or patients for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion.
 
Phase 2:  The drug is studied in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, determine efficacy for specific diseases and establish dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 
Phase 3:  When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range is effective with an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety, are undertaken in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed sites.
 
We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or the IND sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that subjects or patients are exposed to unacceptable health risk. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we also must prepare, within 60 days of an End of Phase 2 meeting, a pediatric study plan or request for waiver or deferral of pediatric studies in the indication under development. Concurrent with these trials and studies, we also develop chemistry and physical characteristics data and finalize a manufacturing process in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must conform to consistency and quality standards, and we must develop methods for testing the quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Appropriate packaging is selected and tested, and chemistry stability studies are conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life. Results of the foregoing are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA (or BLA in case of biologic products) for marketing and commercial shipment approval. The FDA reviews each NDA or BLA submitted and may request additional information. A sixty day period after the sponsor’s submission of an NDA or BLA is used by the FDA to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, in which case the application is accepted for filing.
 
Once the FDA accepts the NDA or BLA for filing, it begins its in-depth review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with our interpretation of the data submitted or identify new concerns. The process may be significantly extended by requests for new information or clarification of information already submitted. As part of this review, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians. Manufacturing establishments often are inspected prior to NDA or BLA approval to assure compliance with GMPs and with manufacturing commitments made in the application.
 
Submission of an NDA or BLA with clinical data requires payment of a substantial fee. In return, the FDA assigns a goal for review and decision on the application, in which the FDA may approve or deny the NDA or BLA, or issue a complete response letter outlining information needed to support approval, including a potential need for additional clinical data. Even if these data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the NDA or BLA does not satisfy approval criteria. If the FDA approves the NDA or BLA, the product becomes available for marketing. Product approval may be withdrawn if regulatory compliance is not maintained or safety problems occur. The FDA may require post-marketing studies, also known as Phase 4 studies, as a condition of approval, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized. The agency has the power to require changes in labeling or prohibit further marketing based on the results of post-marketing surveillance.
 
Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. We cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will approve any of our products on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications or uses.

Even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain regulatory approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
The FDA’s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our potential products. Increased attention to the containment of health care costs worldwide could result in new government regulations materially adverse to our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
 
NDAs for most new drug products generally are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy for the active moiety, or published literature, where such studies were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. We believe that we will be able to utilize the regulatory approval pathway provided in Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA for SYN-010.
 
Orphan Drug Act
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted anti-kickback statues and false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to the delivery of or payments for healthcare benefits, items or services. HIPAA and its implementing regulations also established uniform federal standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.

Because of the breadth of these and other laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Competitive Environment
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multi-national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies developing both generic and proprietary therapies to treat serious diseases. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, human, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the therapeutic areas we are currently pursuing. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for the prevention and treatment of C. difficile infection include: Actelion Pharmaceutical Ltd., Merck & Co. Inc., Merus B.V., Pfizer Inc., and Sanofi S.A. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for IBS-C include: Actavis plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Companies that currently sell or are developing proprietary products for pertussis include: GlaxoSmithKline plc, MitsubishiTanabe Pharma Corporation and Sanofi S.A. Companies that sell or are developing products for the treatment of PKU include: BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Codexis, Inc. and Synlogic, Inc.
 
Academic research centers, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being developed by us. In addition, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us.
