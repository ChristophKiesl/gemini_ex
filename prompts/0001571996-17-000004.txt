ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Fiscal 2017 Significant Developments
On September 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition by merger of EMC Corporation ("EMC"). To finance the EMC merger transaction, we issued $45.9 billion in new debt and $4.4 billion of privately placed common stock. See Note 3, Note 5, and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding the EMC merger transaction and the related financing transactions.
Subsequently in Fiscal 2017, we closed our divestitures of Dell Services, Dell Software Group, and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Division.  We received total cash consideration of approximately $7.0 billion from the divestitures and recorded a gain on sale, net of tax, of approximately $1.9 billion.  For additional information regarding our divestitures, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
With proceeds from the divestitures and cash on hand, we repaid a total of approximately $7.0 billion principal amount of debt incurred in connection with the EMC merger transaction. These repayments primarily consisted of our repayment of approximately $2.2 billion principal amount of our Asset Sale Bridge Facility, approximately $3.1 billion principal amount of our Term Loan A-1 Facility, and approximately $1.6 billion principal amount of our Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 8 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.
 Also noteworthy during Fiscal 2017, SecureWorks Corp. ("SecureWorks"), a subsidiary of Dell Technologies, completed a registered underwritten initial public offering ("IPO") of its Class A common stock on April 27, 2016. SecureWorks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks. SecureWorks' solutions leverage proprietary technologies, processes and extensive expertise in the information security industry. Dell Technologies Inc. held approximately 87.5% of the outstanding equity interest in SecureWorks as of February 3, 2017.

Our next-generation solutions which enable digital transformation include software-defined data centers, all flash arrays, hybrid cloud, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure, cloud-native application development tools, mobile, and security solutions. In addition, our extended warranty and delivery offerings, and software and peripherals, which are closely tied to the sale of our hardware products, are important value differentiators that we are able to offer our customers. 
We believe the combined strength of Dell and EMC will benefit our customers through complementary product portfolios, sales teams, and research and development strategies. During this period of transition and integration, we remain focused on supporting our customers with leading solutions, products, and services. We will continue our focus on building superior customer relationships through our direct model and our network of channel partners, which includes value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers. We also will continue investing in strategic solutions and enhancing our go-to-market sales and marketing capabilities as we seek to create a leading global technology company poised for long-term sustainable growth and innovation. 
Products and Services
We design, develop, manufacture, market, sell, and support a wide range of products and services. We are organized into the following business units, which are our reportable segments: Client Solutions Group; Infrastructure Solutions Group; and VMware. 

• | Client Solutions Group (CSG) — Offerings by CSG (formerly referred to as Client Solutions) include branded hardware, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets, and branded peripherals, such as monitors, printers, and projectors, as well as third-party software, and peripherals. Our computing devices are designed with our commercial and consumer customers' needs in mind, and we seek to optimize performance, reliability, manageability, design, and security. In addition to our traditional personal computer ("PC") business, we also have a portfolio of thin client offerings that is well-positioned to benefit from the growth trends in cloud computing. CSG hardware and services also provide the architecture to enable the Internet of Things and connected ecosystems to securely and efficiently capture massive amounts of data for analytics and actionable insights for commercial customers. CSG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 

Approximately 50% of CSG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and in Asia Pacific and Japan ("APJ"). 

• | Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) — EMC's Information Storage segment and our existing Enterprise Solutions Group were combined in Fiscal 2017 to create the Infrastructure Solutions Group, or ISG. ISG enables the digital transformation of our enterprise customers through our trusted cloud and big data solutions, which are built upon a modern data center infrastructure. The comprehensive portfolio of advanced storage solutions includes traditional storage solutions as well as next-generation storage solutions (including all flash arrays, scale-out file, object platforms, and software-defined solutions). The server portfolio includes high-performance rack, blade, tower, and hyperscale servers. The networking portfolio helps our business customers transform and modernize their infrastructure, mobilize and enrich end-user experiences, and accelerate business applications and processes. Strengths in core server and storage solutions enables us to offer leading converged and hyper-converged solutions, which allow our customers to accelerate their IT transformation by acquiring scalable integrated IT solutions instead of building and assembling their own IT platforms. Similar to CSG, ISG also offers attached software, peripherals, and services, including support and deployment, configuration, and extended warranty services. 

ISG includes Virtustream product and service offerings. Virtustream's cloud software and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions enable customers to migrate, run, and manage mission-critical applications in cloud-based IT environments, and represent a key element of our strategy to help customers support their applications in a variety of cloud native environments.
Approximately 50% of ISG revenue is generated by sales to customers in the Americas, with the remaining portion derived from sales to customers in EMEA and APJ.

• | VMware — The VMware reportable segment ("VMware") reflects the operations of VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW) within Dell Technologies. See Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report for further details on the differences between VMware reportable segment results and VMware, Inc. results. 

VMware is a leader in virtualization and cloud infrastructure solutions, which enable organizations to manage IT resources across complex multi-cloud, multi-device environments. VMware has expanded beyond its core business of compute virtualization to offer a broad portfolio of virtualization technologies across three main product groups: software-defined data center; hybrid cloud computing; and end-user computing. VMware's software-defined data center includes the fundamental compute layer for the data center (vSphere); storage and availability to offer cost-effective holistic data storage and protection options (vSAN); network and security (VMware NSX); and management and automation (vRealize) products. VMware currently enables its customers to utilize off-premises vSphere-based hybrid cloud computing capacity through two offerings: VMware vCloud Air Network and vCloud Air. vCloud Air is a public cloud operated by VMware that includes infrastructure and disaster recovery. VMware vCloud Air Network is a global ecosystem of over 4,300 cloud providers such as IBM, OVH, and Rackspace that provide VMware-based cloud services. In addition, through a strategic alliance with Amazon Web Services ("AWS"), VMware plans to release an integrated hybrid offering, VMware Cloud on AWS, during Fiscal 2018. VMware Cloud on AWS will enable customers to run applications across vSphere-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. VMware's end-user computing offerings (such as AirWatch mobile solutions and Horizon application and desktop virtualization solutions) enable IT organizations to efficiently deliver more secure access to applications, data, and devices for their end users by leveraging VMware's software-defined data center solutions to extend the value of virtualization from data centers to devices.
Approximately 50% of VMware revenue is generated by sales to customers in the United States. 
Our other businesses, described below, consist of product and service offerings of RSA, SecureWorks, Pivotal, and Boomi, Inc. ("Boomi"). These businesses are not classified as reportable segments, either individually or collectively, as the results of the businesses are not material to our overall results and the businesses do not meet the criteria for reportable segments.

• | RSA provides essential cybersecurity solutions engineered to enable organizations to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks, confirm and manage identities, and, ultimately, help reduce IP theft, fraud, and cybercrime.


• | SecureWorks (NASDAQ: SCWX) is a leading global provider of intelligence-driven information security solutions singularly focused on protecting its clients from cyber attacks.


• | Pivotal is a leading provider of application and data infrastructure software, agile development services, and data science consulting. Pivotal's cloud-native platform enables leading companies to transform their operations with an approach that is focused on building software, rather than buying it. 


• | Boomi specializes in cloud-based integration, connecting information between existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to ensure business processes are optimized, data is accurate, and workflow is reliable.

See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information about our other businesses.

Research and Development
We focus on developing scalable technology solutions that incorporate highly desirable features and capabilities at competitive prices. We employ a collaborative approach to product design and development in which our engineers, with direct customer input, design innovative solutions and work with a global network of technology companies to architect new system designs, influence the direction of future development, and integrate new technologies into our products. We manage our research and development ("R&D") spending by targeting those innovations and products that we believe are most valuable to our customers and by relying on the capabilities of our strategic relationships. Through this collaborative, customer-focused approach, we strive to deliver new and relevant products to the market quickly and efficiently. Additionally, from time to time, we make strategic investments in publicly-traded and privately-held companies that develop software, hardware, and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies.
A significant portion of our R&D activities are associated with VMware, which has assembled an experienced group of developers with system level, systems management, desktop, mobile devices, security, application development, collaborative applications, networking, storage, and open source software expertise. VMware also has strong ties to leading academic institutions around the world, and invests in joint research with those institutions. Product development efforts are prioritized through a combination of engineering-driven innovation and customer- and market-driven feedback. 
As of February 3, 2017, we operated 14 global research and development centers, including the Dell Silicon Valley Research and Development Center. Our total R&D expenses were $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion, and $0.9 billion for Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2016, and Fiscal 2015, respectively. These investments reflect our commitment to R&D activities that ultimately support our mission: to help our customers build their digital future and to transform IT.
Manufacturing and Materials
We own manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Malaysia, China, Brazil, India, Poland, and Ireland. See "Item 2 — Properties" for information about our manufacturing and distribution facilities. 
We also utilize contract manufacturers throughout the world to manufacture or assemble our products under the Dell Technologies brand as part of our strategy to enhance our variable cost structure and to achieve our goals of generating cost efficiencies, delivering products faster, better serving our customers, and building a world-class supply chain. 
Our manufacturing process consists of assembly, software installation, functional testing, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Testing and quality control are also applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies, and systems obtained from third-party suppliers. 
Our quality management system is maintained through the testing of components, sub-assemblies, and systems at various stages in the manufacturing process. Quality control procedures also include a burn-in period for completed units after assembly, ongoing production reliability audits, failure tracking for early identification of production and component problems, and information from customers obtained through services and support programs. This system is certified to the ISO 9001 International Standard that includes most of our global sites that design, manufacture, and service our products. 
Our order fulfillment, manufacturing, and test facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Ireland are certified to the ISO 14001 International Standard for environmental management systems and also have achieved OHSAS 18001 certification, an international standard for facilities with world-class safety and health management systems. These internationally-recognized endorsements of ongoing quality and environmental management are among the highest levels of certifications available. We also have implemented Lean Six Sigma methodologies to ensure that the quality of our designs, manufacturing, test processes, and supplier relationships are continually improved. 
We maintain a robust Supplier Code of Conduct, actively manage recycling processes for our returned products, and are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Smartway Transport Partner.
We purchase materials, supplies, product components, and products from a large number of qualified suppliers. In some cases, where multiple sources of supply are not available, we rely on single-source or a limited number of sources of supply if we believe it is advantageous to do so because of performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. We believe that any disruption that may occur because of our dependence on single- or limited-source vendors would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See "Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risk Factors Relating to Our Business — Reliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, 
8

could harm Dell Technologies' business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost" for information about the risks associated with Dell Technologies' use of single- or limited-source suppliers.
Geographic Operations
Our global corporate headquarters is located in Round Rock, Texas. We have operations and conduct business in many countries located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and other geographic regions. To increase our global presence, we continue to focus on emerging markets outside of the United States, Western Europe, Canada, and Japan. We continue to view these geographical markets, which include the vast majority of the world's population, as a long-term growth opportunity. Accordingly, we pursue the development of technology solutions that meet the needs of these markets. Our expansion in emerging markets creates additional complexity in coordinating the design, development, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and support of our product and services offerings. For information about the percentages of revenue we generated from our operations outside of the United States, see Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Competition 
We operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. We face ongoing product and price competition in all areas of our business, including from both branded and generic competitors. We compete based on our ability to offer customers competitive, scalable, and integrated solutions that provide the most current and desired product and services features at a competitive price. We closely monitor market pricing and solution trends, including the effect of foreign exchange rate movements, in an effort to provide the best value for our customers. We believe that our strong relationships with our customers and channel partners allow us to respond quickly to changing customer needs, and other macroeconomic factors.
VMware competes with large and small vendors in different segments of the cloud computing, end-user computing, and virtualization industries, and expects that new entrants will continue to enter these industries and develop technologies that, if commercialized, may compete with VMware's products and services.
Sales and Marketing
We sell products and services directly to customers and through other sales distribution channels, such as retailers, third-party solutions providers, system integrators, and third-party resellers. During Fiscal 2017, our other sales distribution channels contributed approximately 50% of our net revenue. Our customers include large global and national corporate businesses, public institutions that include government, education, healthcare organizations, and law enforcement agencies, small and medium-sized businesses, and consumers. Our sales efforts are organized around the evolving needs of our customers, and our marketing initiatives reflect this focus. We believe that our unified global sales and marketing team creates a sales organization that is more customer-focused, collaborative, and innovative. Our go-to-market strategy includes a direct business model, as well as channel distribution. Our direct business model emphasizes direct communication with customers, thereby allowing us to refine our products and marketing programs for specific customers groups, and we continue to rely on this strategy. In addition to its direct business model, we rely on a network of channel partners to sell our products and services, enabling us to efficiently serve a greater number of customers.
Designed in collaboration with partners and drawing from the best aspects of the former Dell and EMC partner programs, the Dell EMC Partner Program was launched in February 2017. The Dell EMC Partner Program will provide expanded business opportunity for partners and reaffirms Dell EMC's strong commitment to selling products and services through sales distribution channels. The strength of our program is based on a broad product portfolio, along with a program that rewards partners who are trained to effectively position, sell, and service Dell EMC products and go-to-market innovations. 
We market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers through various advertising media. To react quickly to our customers' needs, we track our Net Promoter Score, a customer loyalty metric that is widely used across various industries. Increasingly, we also engage with customers through our social media communities on www.delltechnologies.com and in external social media channels.
For large business and institutional customers, we maintain a field sales force throughout the world. Dedicated account teams, which include technical sales specialists, form long-term relationships to provide our largest customers with a single source of assistance, develop tailored solutions for these customers, positioning the capabilities of Dell Technologies, and provide us with customer feedback. For these customers, we offer several programs designed to provide single points of contact and 
9

accountability with dedicated account managers, special pricing, and consistent service and support programs. We also maintain specific sales and marketing programs targeting federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as healthcare and educational customers.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
As of February 3, 2017, we held a worldwide portfolio of 13,289 patents and had an additional 8,657 patent applications pending. Of those amounts, 1,605 patents and 2,426 patent applications pending were owned by VMware. We also hold licenses to use numerous third-party patents. To replace expiring patents, we obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development activities. The inventions claimed in our patents and patent applications cover aspects of our current and possible future computer system products, manufacturing processes, and related technologies. Our product, business method, and manufacturing process patents may establish barriers to entry in many product lines. Although we use our patented inventions and also license them to others, we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. We have entered into a variety of intellectual property licensing and cross-licensing agreements and software licensing agreements with other companies. We anticipate that our worldwide patent portfolio will be of value in negotiating intellectual property rights with others in the industry. 
We have obtained U.S. federal trademark registration for the Dell word mark and logo mark and the VMware word and logo mark.  We have pending applications to register the Dell EMC word and logo marks. As of February 3, 2017, we owned registrations for 335 of our other trademarks in the United States and had pending applications for registration of 61 other trademarks. We believe that the DELL, Dell EMC, and VMware word marks and logo marks in the United States are material to our operations. As of February 3, 2017, we also had applied for, or obtained registration of, the DELL word mark and several other marks in approximately 183 other countries.
From time to time, other companies and individuals assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to technologies or marks that are alleged to be relevant to the technology industry or our business. We evaluate each claim relating to our products and, if appropriate, seek a license to use the protected technology. The licensing agreements generally do not require the licensor to assist us in duplicating the licensor's patented technology, nor do the agreements protect us from trade secret, copyright, or other violations by us or our suppliers in developing or selling the licensed products.
Unless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are owned by us. We disclaim proprietary interest in the marks and names of others. Net Promoter Score is a trademark of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc., and Fred Reichheld. 
Government Regulation and Sustainability
Government Regulation — Our business is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal and state governmental agencies and other governmental agencies. Such regulation includes the activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission; the anti-trust regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the European Union; the consumer protection laws and financial services regulation of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various state governmental agencies; the export regulatory activities of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of the Treasury; the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the U.S. Department of Transportation; the health information privacy and security requirements of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and the environmental, employment and labor, and other regulatory activities of a variety of governmental authorities in each of the countries in which we conduct business. We were not assessed any material environmental fines, nor did we have any material environmental remediation or other environmental costs, during Fiscal 2017.
Our Philosophy on Sustainability: Building a Legacy of Good — One of the core tenets of Dell Technologies is the belief that technology should drive human progress. Our newly combined company draws on the strengths of the legacy Dell and EMC organizations, and we remain committed to putting our technology and expertise to work where it can do the most good for people and our planet.
This commitment is intimately tied to our business goals of driving growth, helping mitigate risk, and ensuring business opportunities by building our brand. Based on the idea that we all win when we create shared value, we created the Legacy of Good plan to build on the strengths throughout our value chain to create social, environmental, and economic value by uniting our purpose with our business objectives. The plan features 21 bold goals for the year 2020 across the material areas of our business, ultimately setting the agenda for building a better future where everyone can reach their full potential while sharing in and supporting the common good. 
10

As we work towards a consolidated sustainability approach for our newly combined company, we have identified the following key areas of focus:
Creating Net Positive Outcomes — Creating net positive outcomes means putting back more into society, the environment, and the global economy than we take out. In particular, we focus on helping customers harness the power of technology to deliver better social and environmental outcomes. 
Energy Efficiency — We have set a goal to reduce the energy intensity of our entire product portfolio by 80% by 2020. 
Technology Take-back, Reuse, and Recycling — We begin thinking about recycling at the design phase, asking our product engineers to work with recyclers to understand how to make products easy to repair or disassemble for recycling. When our products reach the end of their life cycles, we make it easy for customers to recycle their obsolete electronic equipment. 
Circular Economy and Design for the Environment — Recycling, reuse, and closed-loop manufacturing form the bedrock of the circular economy, ensuring that materials already in circulation stay in the economy instead of exiting as waste. Within our own operations, we look at how materials can be used, or reused, in ways that extend their value. 
Reducing Our Footprint, Caring for Our Planet — We are focused on reducing the impact of our operations on the environment, and our teams examine practices and processes in our own facilities to identify opportunities for greater efficiency. Many of our locations purchase some or all of their electricity from renewable sources and many of our manufacturing facilities are approaching zero waste to landfill. 
Social and Environmental Responsibility ("SER") in the Supply Chain — We are committed to responsible business practices and hold ourselves and our suppliers to a high standard of excellence. We work in partnership with our suppliers to reduce risks that could lead to harm of workers, production suspensions, factory shut-downs, or environmental damage. All of our suppliers must agree to our global supplier principles and accept the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition Code of Conduct. Additionally, we are committed to a conflict-free mineral supply chain. 
Youth Learning — Technology skills are critical to continued innovation and can have a profound effect on our businesses, communities, and sustainability. We have a strong commitment to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math ("STEM") and other youth learning activities, providing funding, volunteer time, and technology to underserved populations. 
Partnering with TGen on Technology for Good — Together with TGen (the Translational Genomics Research Institute), we are changing the paradigm in the treatment of childhood cancers. We developed the Genomic Data Analysis Platform — a complete high-performance computing infrastructure solution uniquely designed to meet the needs of genomic data collection and analysis. This powerful, efficient technology has reduced the time it takes to analyze the 90 billion data points of sequenced genomes from weeks to approximately eight hours.
A sustainability report for Dell Technologies is expected to be available in June 2017. The Dell Inc. 2016 Corporate Social Responsibility Report is available at www.dell.com/crreport. EMC's latest Sustainability Report, "Redefine the Future," is available at www.emc.com/corporate/sustainability/sustainability-reports.htm. 
Product Backlog
We believe that product backlog is not a meaningful indicator of net revenue that can be expected for any period. Our business model generally gives us flexibility to manage product backlog at any point in time by expediting shipping or prioritizing customer orders toward products that have shorter lead times, thereby reducing product backlog and increasing current period revenue. Moreover, product backlog at any point in time may not result in the generation of any predictable amount of net revenue in any subsequent period, as unfilled orders can generally be canceled at any time by the customer.
11

Employees
At the end of Fiscal 2017, we had approximately 138,000 total full-time employees, approximately 20,000 of which were employees of VMware. In comparison, we had approximately 102,000 total full-time employees at the end of Fiscal 2016. The significant increase in the number of full-time employees was due to our acquisition of EMC, the effect of which was partially offset by employee reductions resulting from our divestitures. At the end of Fiscal 2017, approximately 40% of our full-time employees were located in the United States and approximately 60% were located in other countries.
Corporate Information 
We are a holding company that conducts our operations through subsidiaries.
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 31, 2013 under the name of Denali Holding Inc. in connection with Dell's going private transaction, which was completed in October 2013. We changed our name to Dell Technologies Inc. on August 25, 2016. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is One Dell Way, Round Rock, Texas 78682.

The contents of our website are not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K.
DHI Group and Class V Group
Dell Technologies has two groups of common stock, denoted as the DHI Group Common Stock and the Class V Common Stock. The DHI Group Common Stock consists of four classes of common stock, referred to as Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock, and Class D Common Stock. The DHI Group generally refers to the direct and indirect interest of Dell Technologies in all of Dell Technologies' business, assets, properties, liabilities, and preferred stock other than those attributable to the Class V Group, as well as its retained interest in the Class V Group equal to approximately 38% of Dell Technologies' economic interest in the Class V Group as of February 3, 2017. The Class V Common Stock is intended to track the economic performance of approximately 62% of Dell Technologies' economic interest in the Class V Group as of such date. As of February 3, 2017, the Class V Group consisted of approximately 338 million shares of Class A common stock of VMware held by Dell Technologies. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report and Exhibit 99.1 filed with this report for more information regarding the allocation of earnings from Dell Technologies' interest in VMware between the DHI Group and the Class V Common Stock.
