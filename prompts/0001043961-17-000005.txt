Item 1. | Our Business

Transgenomic, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company” or “Transgenomic”) is a biotechnology company advancing personalized medicine for the detection and treatment of cancer and integrated diseases through our proprietary molecular technologies and clinical and research services. A key goal is to bring our Multiplexed ICE COLD-PCR (“MX-ICP”) product to the clinical market through strategic partnerships and licensing agreements, enabling the use of blood and other bodily fluids for more effective and patient-friendly diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cancer.
MX-ICP is technology proprietary to Transgenomic. It is a reagent that improves the ability to detect genetic mutations by 100 - 400 fold over existing technologies. This technology has been validated internally on all currently available sequencing platforms, including Sanger, Next Gen Sequencing and Digital PCR. By enhancing the level of detection of genetic mutations and suppressing the normal, or wild-type DNA, several benefits are provided. It is generally understood that most current technologies are unable to consistently identify mutations that occur in less than approximately 5% of a sample. However, many mutations found at much lower levels, even as low as 0.01%, are known to be clinically relevant and can have significant consequences to a patient: both in terms of how they will respond to a given drug or treatment and how a given tumor is likely to change over time. More importantly, in our view, is the ability to significantly improve the level of detection while using blood, saliva and even urine as a source for DNA, rather than depending on painful, expensive and potentially dangerous tumor biopsies. We believe that this is an important advancement in patient care with respect to cancer detection, treatment and monitoring and can result in significant cost savings for the healthcare system by replacing invasive procedures with the simple collection of blood or other bodily fluids. By broadening the types of samples that can be used for testing and allowing all sequencing platforms to provide improved identification of low level mutations, MX-ICP has the potential to make testing more readily available, more

patient friendly, enable genetic monitoring of disease progression, effectively guide treatment protocols, and reduce the overall cost of diagnosis and monitoring while significantly improving patient outcomes. 
Our laboratory in Omaha, Nebraska is focused on providing genetic analytical services related to oncology and pharmacogenomics research services supporting Phase II and Phase III clinical trials conducted by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our laboratory employs a variety of genomic testing service technologies, including our proprietary MX-ICP technology. ICE COLD-PCR is a proprietary ultra-high sensitivity platform technology with breakthrough potential to enable wide adoption of personalized, precision medicine in cancer and other diseases. It can be run in any laboratory that contains standard PCR systems. MX-ICP enables detection of multiple known and unknown mutations from virtually any sample type, including tissue biopsies, blood, urine, saliva, cell-free DNA (“cfDNA”) and circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”) at levels greater than 1,000-fold higher than standard DNA sequencing techniques. It is easy to implement and use within existing workflows. Our laboratory in Omaha is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) as a high complexity laboratory and is accredited by the College of American Pathologists. 
Our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows for all periods presented reflect our former Genetic Assays and Platforms activities and Patient Testing business as discontinued operations (See Note 3 - “Discontinued Operations”).
Merger and Related Transactions
Merger Agreement
On October 12, 2016, Transgenomic, New Haven Labs Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Transgenomic (“Merger Sub” and, together with Transgenomic, the “Transgenomic Parties”), and Precipio Diagnostics, LLC (“Precipio”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended by the Merger Agreement Amendment (as defined below) the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which Precipio will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Transgenomic (the “Merger”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. On February 2, 2017, Transgenomic, Merger Sub and Precipio entered into a First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement Amendment”) which provided for, among other things, the revision of the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement, the waiver and removal of certain closing conditions and the authorization of certain actions taken by each of Transgenomic and Precipio since the date the Merger Agreement. The parties expect the Merger to close in the second quarter of 2017.
Upon the effectiveness of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), (i) the outstanding common units of Precipio will be converted into the right to receive approximately 160.6 million shares of common stock of New Precipio (“New Precipio common stock”), together with cash in lieu of fractional units, which will result in Precipio common unit holders owning approximately 52% of the issued and outstanding shares of New Precipio common stock on a fully diluted basis, taking into account the issuance of shares of convertible preferred stock of New Precipio (“New Precipio preferred stock”) in the Merger and the private placement as discussed below (the “fully diluted New Precipio common stock”) and (ii) the outstanding preferred units of Precipio will be converted into the right to receive approximately 24.1 million shares of New Precipio preferred stock with an aggregate face amount equal to $3 million (based upon the purchase price of the new preferred stock of New Precipio in the new preferred stock financing), which will result in the Precipio preferred unit holders owning approximately 8% of the fully diluted New Precipio common stock.
The board of managers of Precipio and the boards of directors of Transgenomic and Merger Sub, and Transgenomic, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, have each approved the Merger Agreement and the board of managers of Precipio and the board of directors of Transgenomic have each recommended that their respective equity holders approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Transgenomic will hold a special meeting of its stockholders to approve the issuance of shares of Transgenomic common stock pursuant to the Merger, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rules, as well as certain other matters (the “Special Meeting”).
The Merger Agreement contains various representations, warranties and covenants of the Transgenomic Parties and Precipio, including, among others, covenants (i) by each of Precipio and Transgenomic to operate its business in the ordinary course, (ii) by each of Precipio and Transgenomic not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Merger, (iii) by Precipio to have its members approve the Merger and (iv) by Transgenomic to hold the Special Meeting.
Under the Merger Agreement, Precipio and Transgenomic are subject to customary “no shop” provisions that limit their respective abilities to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties or to provide confidential information to third parties, subject to a “fiduciary out” provision that allows Precipio and Transgenomic to provide information and participate in 
5

discussions with respect to certain unsolicited written proposals and to terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement (a “Superior Proposal”).
Completion of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including, among others: (i) approval of the holders of a majority of Transgenomic’s shares of outstanding common stock, (ii) approval of the requisite amount of the members of Precipio, (iii) approval of an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of Transgenomic contemplating the New Preferred Stock Financing (described below) and changing the name of Transgenomic to Precipio, Inc. or such other name as determined by Precipio, (iv) obtaining certain third party consents, (v) the absence of any judgment, injunction, order or decree prohibiting or enjoining the completion of the Merger, (vi) consummation of the New Preferred Stock Financing, (vii) approval of listing of New Precipio common stock on Nasdaq, (viii) the conversion of all outstanding membership interests of Precipio into common units or preferred units which will be converted into New Precipio common stock or New Precipio preferred stock as Merger consideration, as applicable, (ix) increase in the size of the Transgenomic board by two members and the appointment of designees in accordance with the Merger Agreement and (x) the lock-up of certain Transgenomic stockholders and Precipio members.
Upon completion of the merger, New Precipio will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to maintain the listing and continued trading of its shares on Nasdaq. These initial listing requirements are more difficult to achieve than the continued listing requirements. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Transgenomic agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Transgenomic common stock being issued in the merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq at or prior to the effective time of the merger. Based on information currently available to Transgenomic, Transgenomic anticipates that its stock will be unable to meet the $4.00 (or, to the extent applicable, $3.00) minimum bid price initial listing requirement at the closing of the merger unless it effects a reverse stock split. On October 31, 2016, the stockholders of Transgenomic authorized the Transgenomic Board to effect a reverse stock split of the shares of Transgenomic common stock at a ratio of between one-for-ten to one-for-thirty. In addition, often times a reverse stock split will not result in a trading price for the affected common stock that is proportional to the ratio of the split.
In addition, the obligation of the parties to complete the Merger is subject to certain other conditions, including (i) subject to the standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) compliance of each party with its covenants in all material respects and (iii) no material adverse effect of either party.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Transgenomic Parties and Precipio. Either may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not completed on or before the date that is six months following the date of the Merger Agreement. In the Merger Agreement Amendment, this date was extended to June 30, 2017. Moreover, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement if the other party changes its recommendation to its security holders to approve the Merger and the related transactions or enter into an agreement with a third party regarding a Superior Proposal.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated by Precipio or Transgenomic pursuant to (i) the Transgenomic board failing to recommend that Transgenomic’s stockholders vote to approve the issuance of New Precipio common stock in connection with the merger; (ii) Transgenomic failing to include in this proxy statement a recommendation by the Transgenomic board to vote in favor of the each of the proposals in this proxy statement; (iii) the Transgenomic board failing to make, withholding, withdrawing, amending, changing, qualifying or publicly proposing to withhold, withdraw, amend, change or qualify in a manner adverse to Precipio, its recommendation that the stockholders of Transgenomic vote in favor and adopt each of the proposals in this proxy statement, knowingly making any public statement inconsistent with such recommendation, failing to recommend against acceptance of any alternate acquisition proposal within ten business days after the public announcement of any such alternate acquisition proposal, approving, adopting, recommending or proposing publicly to approve, adopt or recommend any alternate acquisition proposal, or making any public statement inconsistent with its recommendation; (iv) Transgenomic entering into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract relating to any alternate acquisition proposal or (v) Transgenomic entering into a definitive agreement to effect an alternate acquisition proposal, then Transgenomic shall pay to Precipio, by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three business days after termination of the Merger Agreement, a nonrefundable fee in an amount equal to $256,500.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated by Transgenomic or Precipio pursuant to (i) Precipio’s board of managers failing to recommend that its members vote or act by written consent to approve the merger; (ii) Precipio’s board of managers failing to make, withholding, withdrawing, amending, changing, qualifying or publicly proposing to withhold, withdraw, amend, change or qualify in a manner adverse to Transgenomic, its recommendation that the members of Precipio vote in favor of each of the merger, the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transaction contemplated therein, knowingly making any public statement inconsistent with such recommendation, failing to recommend against acceptance of any alternate acquisition proposal within ten business days after the public announcement of any such alternate acquisition proposal, approving, adopting, recommending or proposing publicly to approve, adopt or recommend any alternate acquisition proposal, or making any public statement inconsistent with its recommendation; (iii) Precipio entering into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract relating to any alternate acquisition proposal; or (iv) Precipio entering into a definitive agreement to effect an alternate acquisition 
6

proposal, Precipio shall pay to Transgenomic, by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three business days after termination of the Merger Agreement, a nonrefundable fee in an amount equal to $256,500.
In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Transgenomic and members and warrant holders of Precipio (collectively, the “Supporting Members”), entered into a voting agreement (the “Precipio Voting Agreement”) pursuant to which the Supporting Members agreed to, among other things, (i) authorize and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) vote against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Collectively, the shares held by the Supporting Members represent approximately 71% of Precipio’s issued and outstanding membership interests.
Precipio and certain Transgenomic stockholders (the “Supporting Stockholders”) also entered into a voting agreement (the “Transgenomic Voting Agreement”) pursuant to which the Supporting Stockholders agreed to, among other things, (i) authorize and approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) vote against any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Collectively, the shares held by the Supporting Stockholders represent approximately 31.84% of Transgenomic’s voting stock.
The Merger Agreement also provides that the combined company will enter into employment agreements with certain employees of Precipio at the Effective Time and that the officers of the combined company will be agreed to by the parties prior to the Effective Time.
Conversion of Secured Debt
In connection with the Merger, at the Effective Time, in addition to the New Precipio preferred stock to be issued to holders of preferred units of Precipio, New Precipio also will issue shares of New Precipio preferred stock and New Precipio common stock to holders of certain secured indebtedness of Transgenomic, whereby such holders will receive in exchange for such indebtedness, approximately 24.1 million shares of New Precipio Preferred Shares in an amount equal to $3.0 million, which represents approximately 8% of the fully diluted New Precipio common stock, and approximately 10.4 million shares of New Precipio common stock, which represents approximately 3% of the fully diluted New Precipio common stock.
Private Placement
In addition and as a condition to the Merger and conversion of secured debt, New Precipio also will issue shares of New Precipio preferred stock and New Precipio common stock in a related private placement, whereby New Precipio will issue for cash up to approximately 56.2 million shares of New Precipio preferred stock for $7.0 million to investors in a private placement, which represents approximately 18% of the fully diluted New Precipio common stock.
The New Precipio preferred stock issued in the Merger, the conversion of secured debt and the private placement will be issued based on a $25 million pre-money equity valuation of New Precipio and will represent, in the aggregate, approximately 34% of the fully diluted New Precipio common stock.
The New Precipio preferred stock to be issued in the Merger and the private placement will be new designations of preferred shares effectuated by a Certificate of Designation amending Transgenomic’s Certificate of Incorporation. The cash proceeds received from the private placement will be used to finance the Merger, for working capital and growth capital to expand into new markets. 
The shares of New Precipio preferred stock may be convertible into New Precipio common stock any time at an applicable conversion price. Certain material corporate events also will require the consent of a supermajority of holders of the New Precipio preferred stock. In the event of New Precipio’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the New Precipio preferred stock will be entitled to receive assets or surplus funds of New Precipio in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 1.5 times the original purchase price of the New Precipio preferred stock, plus an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends and dividend equivalents and (ii) the amount that would be payable on the New Precipio preferred stock if it were converted into New Precipio common stock (the “Liquidation Preference”). This Liquidation Preference also would be due in the event of a future merger or sale of New Precipio, unless a supermajority of holders of New Precipio preferred stock elect otherwise. The New Precipio preferred stock will be entitled to an annual 8% cumulative payment in lieu of interest or dividends, payable in-kind for the first two years and in cash or in-kind thereafter, at the option of the holder. The New Precipio preferred stock also will be entitled to share on any dividends paid on the New Precipio common stock.
In connection with the private placement, New Precipio will enter into an investor rights agreement with the holders of the New Precipio preferred stock. The investor rights agreement will grant rights to such parties, including with respect to the designation of nominees for election to the New Precipio board of directors upon the closing of the Merger. The investor rights agreement also will contain transfer restrictions and standstill restrictions relating to shares of New Precipio common stock that will be issued to such parties in connection with the Merger and the private placement. In addition, the investor rights agreement 
7

gives such parties rights with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the shares of New Precipio common stock to be issued to such parties, including the shares that may be issued upon future conversion of the New Precipio preferred stock.
Business Strategy 
Our primary objective is to commercialize MX-ICP for the clinical diagnostics market through strategic licensing agreements. MX-ICP facilitates the use of blood and other bodily fluids for the effective and efficient diagnosis and treatment of cancer. It does this by enhancing the level of detection of mutant DNA by 100 - 400 fold. In tumors, mutations can often be found occurring with a frequency of around 5%, which current technologies can readily identify. However, other mutations can be present at much lower frequencies. MX-ICP makes possible as low as 0.01% levels of detection of mutant DNA. We believe that MX-ICP can help dramatically improve the diagnosis and treatment/monitoring of cancer patients. Using MC-ICP-based tests, clinicians can rapidly, effectively and economically monitor a patient’s therapy and progress on an ongoing basis. We plan to commercialize this product directly, but also anticipate partnering with a significant number of life sciences companies and academic institutes to accelerate the adoption and use of the technology. We continue to collaborate with a number of major academics including the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (“DFCI”) and Melbourne University. 
Our next set of objectives focuses on strengthening our existing business opportunities around MX-ICP. We continue to provide products and services to biomedical researchers, physicians, medical institutions and diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies that are tied to identifying and understanding genetic mutations and variations and their roles in disease mainly focused on cancer. Our products and services help scientists and physicians understand and predict disease and drug response mainly focused on cancer. As medical practitioners learn to correlate specific mutations and patterns of mutation with specific cancer disease states, drug responses and patient outcomes, it becomes possible to optimize a treatment regimen to a specific patient. This is known as personalized or precision medicine. 
Our internal estimates for the size of the cancer diagnostics market, based on multiple industry sources, suggests a rapidly growing market with a potential annual value of $28 billion (Piper Jaffray Report 2015), built on tissue biopsies and accounting for growth due to the potential for liquid biopsies or increased testing to monitoring cancer patients. Growth in this market has been in part fueled by the rapid adoption of Next-Generation Sequencing (“NGS”) and Digital PCR, along with an emphasis by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) for better and more uniform compliance regarding Laboratory Designed Test assays and will be accelerated further by the adoption of liquid biopsies in association with the sequencing platforms. One of the main reasons for this is that there is still a need for more informative data to help guide treatment. We believe that this will only occur when there is a move to blood and liquid testing of cancer patients earlier and more regularly (monitoring) to ensure more accurate diagnoses and more targeted and effective treatments. Additionally the desire for less costly and easier sample collection will drive the adoption of blood and liquid testing. We believe that MX-ICP is at the forefront of technologies designed to accomplish this transition away from traditional tissue biopsies, analysis and monitoring and will help precision medicine to become a reality. 
Transgenomic does not intend to build the extensive infrastructure necessary to fully commercialize MX-ICP alone. While there are applications of the technology that we will sell directly, we anticipate that the majority of revenues over time will be generated through a combination of exclusive, non-exclusive or semi-exclusive licenses to partners and collaborators. Our goal is to establish the fastest time to market possible for our product and to leverage already existing infrastructure rather than depend on making significant capital expenditures or other investments of our own. Our potential partners generally fall into one of three categories:

• | Laboratory instrumentation and reagents suppliers (such as: Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Illumina, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Qiagen N.V. and VWR, Inc.). The usefulness of MX-ICP across all platforms and its ability to detect tumor mutations in a wide range of samples make such companies natural partners for Transgenomic. We believe that MX-ICP has the potential to greatly expand the market for cancer monitoring as a complement, not as a competitor, to existing products. 


• | Pharmaceutical/Biotechnology companies and Clinical Research Organizations (CRO's) (such as: Amgen Inc., Novartis AG, Clovis Oncology, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Covance Inc., Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc. and PPD Inc). For companies developing and testing new cancer drugs, MX-ICP has the potential to allow the implementation of blood based testing for cancer, improve the level of detection of low level mutations, resurrect failed drug targets, reduce the risk of clinical trials, stratify populations before studies start to enhance success rates, identify low level mutations that cause side effects, as well as support the development of companion diagnostics to match drugs with patients.


• | Clinical Laboratories (such as: LifeLabs, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and the many CLIA-certified laboratories including major academic centers such as Dana Fabre

8

Cancer Institute (DFCI) Mayo, Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and MD Anderson throughout the United States). MX-ICP would allow clinical laboratories (Molecular Diagnostics Labs) to effectively compete with more specialized providers and to become full service providers as personalized, precision medicine becomes more widely adopted and improves patient care and outcomes.
The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the solutions that it desires to offer as part of its family of products and services. We work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions, investments and alliances. We employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced products and services:

• | Enhancing the product mutation coverage and improving its performance;


• | Developing new technologies and products internally; and


• | Entering into joint-development efforts with other companies and academics.

Our strategy is to leverage the discoveries in our laboratory to create “kits” or assays or CLIA tests, for clients in our laboratory, to distribute directly ourselves and via our strategic partnerships and licensing agreements.
We will continue to develop new applications for, and enhancements of, MX-ICP and capitalize on our expertise and intellectual properties to develop unique new applications of the MX-ICP technology for potential partnerships. We will focus on growth in our core markets via direct sales and business development activities with industry leaders across the globe. 
Products 
MX-ICP is our proprietary technology product with industry transforming potential. It is exclusively licensed by Transgenomic from Dana-Faber Cancer Institute. MX-ICP is a unique amplification technology that suppresses wild-type (normal) DNA and thereby enables the selective amplification of all mutations (genetic alterations) present in that region of the genome. As a result of its ultra-high sensitivity (1,000 times more sensitive than standard DNA sequencing alone), it works on almost all sample types that contain DNA, including tissue, blood, urine and saliva or sputum; it can be used on all sequencing platforms; and it is easily implemented into standard laboratory processes without significant investment of time or resources. MX-ICP has applications in all therapeutic areas, but the first and major focus at this time is the estimated expanding $28 billion market for liquid biopsies and cancer testing. The Company also believes that the current market for clinical diagnostic (MDx) use of PCR, which is estimated to be in excess of $10 billion in 2015 based on external reports, will continue to grow and is a validation of the size of market for this type of technology and product. Importantly, MX-ICP is platform agnostic and can therefore be integrated and implemented into any clinical testing, basic research or biopharmaceutical laboratory. In addition, the MX-ICP product is a simple chemical reagent that is able to be mass-produced and supplied efficiently to any end user.
Our highly specialized genetics analytical services and expertise are utilized in our CLIA-certified laboratory in Omaha, Nebraska. Our laboratory supports pharmaceutical companies and CRO's in their clinical trials, primarily Phase II and Phase III trials, and has over 20 years of clinical trials development experience and its clients include many of the top 20 worldwide pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies. 
Our expanding oncology tests are focused heavily on genetic mutations commonly associated with the major cancer types - NSCLC (lung), CRC (colorectal), breast, melanoma and prostate. We primarily test for mutations in the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA genes, all associated with the most common types of cancers. The presence or absence of these mutations increasingly influences oncologists’ treatment choices for their patients. We have been focused on testing for low level mutations in colorectal cancer tissue biopsies that are targets for new therapies, and we intend to continue this and improve on it as we incorporate our MX-ICP technology products into our oncology testing menu. We also offer tests for hereditary cancer-predisposing syndromes.
Sales and Marketing 
Our strategy for commercializing MX-ICP is to focus on enabling strategic technology licensing agreements with established partners in the fields of: instrumentation and reagent suppliers, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and clinical laboratories. 
The commercial focus is broken down into three categories:
1.Services: performing services for pharmaceuticals/biotechnology companies and CRO's in order to enable them to submit their drug targets to the FDA for approval
2.Products: this includes MX-ICP kits for research use and MX-ICP CLIA Testing for oncologists in the United States
9

3.Licensing: strategic partnerships and likening agreements to grant companies, academics and clinical laboratories with various levels of access to MX-ICP
We see over time that the majority of our revenues will come from the later “licensing” agreements and will be of a high margin, but in the near term (first two years) revenue is expected to be generated from all three commercial areas. We are focusing on these business to business activities and using our direct staff and external consultants with significant market and domain expertise to accelerate this strategy. 
Customers 
We expect to expand our customer base through licensing and partnership agreements for MX-ICP with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and clinical laboratories.
Research and Development 
We continue to invest in research and development in order to remain competitive and to take advantage of new business opportunities as they arise. We maintain a program of research and development with respect to platform technologies, such as ICE COLD-PCR, instruments, test kits and services, engaging existing and new technologies to create scientific and medical applications that will add value to patient care as well as significant commercial value. Major areas of focus include the (i) development of ICE COLD-PCR applications for ultra-high sensitivity mutation detection in any liquid (including blood, sputum and urine) and tissue samples (fresh, frozen, FNA, FFPE, etc.); (ii) development of a new strategy for mutation detection and sequence confirmation using micro-capillary electrophoresis; (iii) use of commercially-available assays and the development of custom assays for detection of somatic mutations in cancer samples using NGS and digital PCR or droplet PCR; and (iv) development of biomarker assays for the marketplace. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our research and development expenses related to continuing operations were $1.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Manufacturing
Historically, we manufactured bioconsumable products including our test kits, separation columns, liquid reagents and enzymes. The major components of our WAVE Systems were manufactured for us by a third party. We integrated our hardware and software with these third party manufactured components. Our manufacturing facilities for WAVE Systems and bioconsumables were located in Omaha, Nebraska and San Jose, California. The historical costs of operating the manufacturing facilities are included in our results for discontinued operations. 
Intellectual Property 
To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, license agreements’ contractual confidentiality provisions and confidentiality agreements. Our ICE COLD-PCR platform technology is protected by in-licensed patents that expire in various periods through 2031. As part of the FAMILION acquisition in 2010, we acquired exclusive rights to the FAMILION family of genetic tests for inherited disease, including the patents protecting this technology. Our FAMILION patents and acquired technology are included as part of our discontinued operations. As we expand our product offerings, we also are extending our patent development efforts to protect such product offerings. Established competitors, as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property, may already have patents covering similar products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our products, or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all. While we have pursued and continue to pursue patent protection for our technologies, we may, from time to time, abandon certain patents and patent applications for business reasons. However, while patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent.
We will continue to file patent applications, seek new licenses, take advantage of available copyright and trademark protections and implement appropriate trade secret protocols to protect our intellectual property. Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our products and proprietary technologies will not occur.
Although we believe that our developed and licensed intellectual property rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Further, there can be no assurance that intellectual property protection will be available for our products in the U.S. or foreign countries.
Like many companies in the biotechnology and other high-tech industries, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights to business processes, technologies and related standards that are relevant to us and our customers. These assertions have increased over time as a result 
10

of the general increase in patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Third parties may also claim that their intellectual property rights are being infringed by our customers’ use of a business process method that utilizes products in conjunction with other products, which could result in indemnification claims against us by our customers. Any claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and a distraction to management, result in costly litigation, cause product delivery delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay damages or amounts in settlement, prohibit us from selling certain products or require us to develop alternative non-infringing technology. We could also be required to defend or indemnify our customers against such claims.
Government Regulation
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and municipal environmental and safety laws based on our use of hazardous materials in both manufacturing and research and development operations. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, if we cause contamination to the environment, intentionally or unintentionally, we could be responsible for damages related to the clean-up of such contamination or individual injury caused by such contamination. We cannot predict how changes in laws and regulations will impact how we conduct our business operations in the future or whether the costs of compliance will increase in the future.

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is not currently required for the current product offerings/services provided by Transgenomic and is not expected to be a significant factor in the manufacturing, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products and systems, especially when considering our current partnership and licensing strategy. However, we continue to monitor and engage in dialog with the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Please see the section of this Annual Report entitled “Risk Factors” for other risks associated with regulatory requirements.
Competition 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technological advances. Many of our competitors possess greater resources than us and may be able to develop and offer a greater breadth of products and/or services, coupled with significant marketing and distribution capabilities. We compete principally on the basis of uniquely enabling scientific technical advantages in specific but significant market segments.

Recent Events
Amendment to Merger Agreement
As previously reported on October 13, 2016, Transgenomic, Merger Sub, and Precipio entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Precipio will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transgenomic (the “Merger”), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Following the Merger, Transgenomic will change its name to Precipio, Inc. (“New Precipio”).
On February 2, 2017, Transgenomic, Merger Sub and Precipio entered into a First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement Amendment”) which provided for, among other things, the following: (a) the authorization of a line of credit up to $250,000 provided by Precipio to Transgenomic pursuant to an unsecured promissory note (as discussed below under the caption “Bridge Financing”); (b) the revision of the exchange ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement to provide that issued and outstanding common units of Precipio prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive an amount of shares of New Precipio common stock (“New Precipio common stock”) equal to 79% of the issued and outstanding shares of New Precipio common stock (not taking into account the issuance of shares of convertible preferred stock of New Precipio (“New Precipio preferred stock”) in the Merger or related private placement); (c) the waiver as a condition to the closing of the Merger of the continual listing of the existing shares of Transgenomic’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; (d) the extension of the deadline pursuant to which a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 or other appropriate form is required to be filed by New Precipio with the Securities Exchange Commission to June 1, 2017; (e) the authorization for certain indebtedness of New Precipio to remain outstanding as of the effective date of the Merger; (f) the authorization of certain actions taken by each of Transgenomic and Precipio since the date the Merger Agreement; (g) the removal from the Merger Agreement of certain conditions to closing of the Merger; and (h) the extension of the date that either Transgenomic or Precipio may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated to June 30, 2017.
Conversion of Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes
On January 20, 2015, Transgenomic entered into a series of Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes with seven accredited investors (the “Investors”) in the principal amount of $925,000 (the “Notes”). Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, interest accrues at a rate of 6% per year and is due and payable by Transgenomic on December 31, 2016 (the “Maturity Date”). Transgenomic also issued, to its placement agent for the Notes, a convertible promissory note, upon the same terms and conditions as the Notes, in an aggregate principal amount equal to 5% of the proceeds received by Transgenomic, or $46,250 (the “Agent Note”). The Notes 
12

are convertible into shares of Transgenomic’s common stock at the option of the Investors and as of December 31, 2016 $400,000 of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, and accrued interest thereon, has been converted into an aggregate of 281,023 shares of Transgenomic’s common stock. On the Maturity Date, the then outstanding aggregate amount owed on the Notes and Agent Note of $638,016 ($571,250 in principal amount and $66,766 of accrued interest) became due. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, Transgenomic’s failure to pay any principal or interest within 10 days of the date such payment is due would constitute an event of default (the “Prospective Event of Default”).
On January 10, 2017, the Investors executed a waiver of the Prospective Event of Default, pursuant to which, the Investors agreed to waive the Prospective Event of Default on the condition that Transgenomic and the Investors enter into definitive documentation evidencing the terms for an extended Maturity Date of the Notes and the Agent Note on or before January 16, 2017 (the “Waiver Deadline”).
On January 13, 2017, all but one Investor exercised their conversion rights relating to their respective Notes, including the Agent Note, and agreed to convert an aggregate amount of $499,359 of principal and interest due under the Notes and Agent Note into 416,133 shares of Transgenomic’s common stock. The Waiver Deadline was extended with respect to the remaining Investor who had exercised conversion rights (the “Non-Converting Investor”) so that the parties could continue to discuss a resolution of the Prospective Event of Default relating to such Investor’s Note with an outstanding amount due of $139,876 as of January 13, 2017 ($125,000 in principal amount and $14,876 of accrued interest).
On January 17, 2017, the Non-Converting Investor agreed to extend the Maturity Date of its Note pursuant to an amendment to the Note (the “Amendment”). The Amendment provides that two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of the Note must be paid upon the earlier to occur of the close of Transgenomic’s merger with Precipio or June 16, 2017 (such applicable date, the “Deferred Maturity Date”). The remaining one-third of the principal amount outstanding on the Note must be paid on the six month anniversary of the Deferred Maturity Date (the “Extended Maturity Date”).
On the applicable Deferred Maturity Date, all accrued and unpaid interest on the Note as of the Deferred Maturity Date will be converted into shares of Transgenomic’s common stock at a conversion price based on the average closing price of Company common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of conversion, but in no event will the conversion price be less than $0.25 per share. Interest that accrues on the remaining principal amount of the Note from the Deferred Maturity Date will be payable on the Extended Maturity Date, unless the Note is converted in which case such interest will be payable in shares of Transgenomic’s common stock as part of the conversion.
In exchange for extending the Maturity Date of the Note, Transgenomic will issue to the Non-Converting Investor on the applicable Deferred Maturity Date a warrant to purchase shares of Transgenomic’s common stock having an aggregate value of $6,250 with an exercise price to be determined as of the date of issuance of the warrant based on the average closing price of Company common stock on Nasdaq for the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of issuance of the warrant, subject to the approval of Nasdaq if necessary. The warrant will expire two years from the date of issuance.
Delisting from Nasdaq
As previously disclosed, on February 17, 2017, Transgenomic received written notification from the staff of Nasdaq that, as a result of Transgenomic’s inability to maintain certain Nasdaq continued listing requirements, Nasdaq had determined to delist Transgenomic’s shares from Nasdaq. Accordingly, trading in Transgenomic’s shares was suspended, and on February 22, 2017, Transgenomic’s shares began trading on the OTCQB exchange under the ticker “TBIO”.
Change in Transgenomic’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
On January 12, 2017, the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Transgenomic approved the dismissal of Ernst & Young LLP (“Ernst & Young”) as Transgenomic’s independent registered public accounting firm and accordingly Transgenomic notified Ernst & Young of such action effective as of January 12, 2017.
The dismissal of Ernst & Young as Transgenomic’s independent registered public accounting firm did not result from any dissatisfaction with the quality of professional services rendered by Ernst & Young.
13

The audit reports of Ernst & Young on Transgenomic’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the two most recent fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles other than reference to substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
During Transgenomic’s two most recent fiscal years, and any subsequent interim period prior to termination of the client-auditor relationship with Ernst & Young on January 12, 2017, there were no “disagreements” (as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between Transgenomic and Ernst & Young on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young, would have caused Ernst & Young to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in their reports on Transgenomic’s consolidated financial statements with respect to such periods.
During Transgenomic’s two most recent fiscal years, and any subsequent interim period prior to termination of the client-auditor relationship with Ernst & Young on January 12, 2017, there were no “reportable events” as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions, except for the material weaknesses in Transgenomic’s internal control over financial reporting disclosed in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (filed April 15, 2015), related to the design of controls over proper timing and recognition of revenue and over the elements used in Transgenomic’s analysis and evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that the allowance for doubtful accounts was reasonably stated. The ineffectiveness of these controls did not result in an adjustment to the financial statements or a restatement of prior year financial statements. In response to the material weaknesses, Transgenomic’s management developed remediation plans to address the control deficiencies identified in 2014. These remediation actions were implemented during 2015 and included enhancements that included (i) with respect to revenue recognition, (a) a reconciliation of proof of delivery (fax confirmation) for invoiced and unbilled reports and (b) a review of error processing queues, among other steps, and (ii) with respect to allowances for doubtful accounts, (a) a review of the payor and client accounts receivable aging (b) review of write offs, (c) a review of current and historical payment trends and (d) a review of actual cash collections and a hindsight analysis, among other steps. Transgenomic’s management determined that these remediation actions were effectively designed and demonstrated effective operation for a sufficient period of time to enable Transgenomic’s management to conclude that the 2014 material weaknesses were remediated as of December 31, 2015.
Effective as of February 24, 2017, Transgenomic, as approved by the Audit Committee, engaged Marcum LLP (“Marcum”) as Transgenomic’s independent registered public accounting firm to audit Transgenomic’s consolidated financial statements for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
During Transgenomic’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and in the subsequent interim period through February 24, 2017, neither Transgenomic nor anyone on its behalf consulted Marcum regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Transgenomic’s financial statements, in connection with which either a written report or oral advice was provided to Transgenomic that Marcum concluded was an important factor considered by Transgenomic in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and Item 304(a)(1)(v), respectively.
Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement
On February 2, 2017, Transgenomic entered into the Termination and Tenth Amendment (the “Loan Agreement Amendment”) to its Loan and Security Agreement, dated March 13, 2013, with Third Security Senior Staff 2008 LLC, as administrative agent and a lender, and the other lenders party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”), as amended, for a revolving line of credit and a term loan (as so amended, the “Loan Agreement”). The Loan Agreement Amendment, among other things, (i) provides that the Lenders will waive specified events of default under the terms of the Loan Agreement until the effective time of the Merger (or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms), (ii) provides for the conversion of all outstanding indebtedness owed to the Lenders under the Loan Agreement (the “Outstanding Indebtedness”) into shares of Transgenomic common stock and preferred stock (collectively, the “Conversion Shares”) effective as of the closing date of the Merger and (iii) the termination of the Loan Documents (as defined in the Loan Agreement) and the termination and release of all security interests and liens of the Lenders in the Collateral (as defined in the Loan Agreement) in each case immediately following the conversion of the Outstanding Indebtedness into Conversion Shares.
14

The effectiveness of certain provisions in the Loan Agreement Amendment, including provisions relating to conversion of the Conversion Shares and termination of the Loan Documents, is conditioned on, among other things, the consummation of the Merger, and, in the event that the Merger is not consummated, these provisions in the Loan Agreement Amendment will terminate.
As noted above, in connection with the Loan Agreement Amendment, the Lenders have agreed to convert the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Loan Agreement into (i) approximately 10.4 million shares of New Precipio common stock immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger at a price equal to $0.50 per share and (ii) 24.1 million shares of New Precipio preferred stock. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding amount owed under the Loan Agreement was approximately $7.2 million of principal and $0.6 million of accrued interest. The issuance of the Conversion Shares is subject to the approval of the Transgenomic stockholders in accordance with Nasdaq Capital Market listing rules.
The Lenders are affiliates of Third Security, LLC, whose affiliates hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of Transgenomic. Additionally, Doit L. Koppler II, a director of Transgenomic, is affiliated with Third Security, LLC and its affiliates.
Legal Proceedings
Transgenomic is subject to a number of claims of various amounts that arise out of the normal course of its business. In addition to the claims described in this “Legal Proceedings” section, Transgenomic is delinquent on the payment of outstanding accounts payable amounting to approximately $0.6 million with certain of Transgenomic’s vendors and suppliers who have taken or have threatened to take legal action to collect such outstanding amounts. 
On February 25, 2016, UNMC filed a lawsuit against Transgenomic in the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska, for breach of contract and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by Transgenomic to UNMC. Transgenomic and UNMC entered into a settlement agreement dated February 6, 2017, which included, among other things, a mutual general release of claims, and Transgenomic’s agreement to pay $0.4 million to UNMC in installments over a period of time. As of March 15, 2017, Transgenomic’s initial payment due to UNMC under their settlement agreement is delinquent. Transgenomic and UNMC are currently in discussions to extend the date of Transgenomic’s intial payment due to UNMC. A $0.4 million and $0.7 million liability has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
In addition, on April 13, 2016, Fox Chase filed a lawsuit against Transgenomic in the Court of Common Pleas, alleging, among other things, breach of contract, tortious interference with present and prospective contractual relations, unjust enrichment, fraudulent conversion and conspiracy and seeking punitive damages in addition to damages and other relief. This lawsuit relates to a license agreement between Transgenomic and Fox Chase ( the “License Agreement”) as well as the assignment of certain of Transgenomic’s rights under the License Agreement to IDT pursuant to the IDT Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the IDT Agreement, Transgenomic agreed to indemnify IDT with respect to certain of the claims asserted in the Fox Chase proceeding. On July 8, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas sustained Transgenomic’s preliminary objections to several of Fox Chase’s claims and dismissed the claims for tortious interference, fraudulent conversion, conspiracy, punitive damages and attorney’s fees.  Accordingly, the case has been narrowed so that only certain contract claims and an unjust enrichment claim remain pending against Transgenomic. Transgenomic believes that it has good and substantial defenses to the claims asserted by Fox Chase. Transgenomic is unable to determine whether any loss will occur or to estimate the range of such potential loss; therefore, no amount of loss has been accrued by Transgenomic as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that Transgenomic will prevail in this suit or receive any damages or other relief if it does prevail.
On June 23, 2016, Mount Sinai filed a lawsuit against Transgenomic in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, alleging, among other things, breach of contract and, alternatively, unjust enrichment and quantum merit, and seeking recovery of $0.7 million owed by Transgenomic to Mount Sinai for services rendered. Transgenomic and Mount Sinai entered into a settlement agreement dated October 27, 2016, which included, among other things, a mutual general release of claims, and Transgenomic’s agreement to pay approximately $0.7 million to Mount Sinai in installments over a period of time. A $0.7 million liability has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016. Effective as of February 1, 2017, Transgenomic and Mount Sinai agreed to amend the terms of their settlement agreement to extend the date of Transgenomic’s initial payment due to Mount Sinai.
On December 19, 2016, Todd Smith filed a lawsuit against Transgenomic in the District Court of Douglas County Nebraska, alleging breach of contract and seeking recovery of $2.2 million owed by Transgenomic to Todd Smith for costs and damages arising from a breach of Transgenomic’s obligations pursuant to lease agreement between the parties. Transgenomic and Todd Smith are currently in discussions to determine a mutually agreeable means by which to settle the outstanding liability.

On February 21, 2017, XIFIN, Inc. (“XIFIN”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court for the Southern District of California alleging breach of written contract and seeking recovery of approximately $0.27 million owed by us to XIFIN for damages arising from a breach of our obligations pursuant to a Systems Services Agreement between us and XIFIN, dated as of February 22, 2013, as amended and restated on September 1, 2014. On April 4, 2017, XIFIN filed an application for an entry of default by the clerk of the court against us. A $0.21 million liability has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016.
We and Science Park Development Corporation (“SPDC”) entered into that certain Lease dated as of December 31, 2011, as modified by the First Amendment to Lease dated as of June 18, 2013, as further modified by a letter agreement dated as of February 2, 2015, as modified by the Second Amendment to Lease dated as of June 26, 2015 (the “ SPDC Lease”). In November 2016, SPDC alleged that we defaulted on our obligations under the SPDC Lease. Specifically, SPDC alleges that we failed to pay approximately $0.4 million in rental payments due under the SPDC Lease and that we vacated a portion of the leased premises in violation of the terms of the SPDC Lease. Transgenomic and SPDC entered into a settlement agreement dated March 6, 2017, which included, among other things, a mutual general release of claims, and Transgenomic’s agreement to pay approximately $0.4 million to SPDC in installments over a period of time.
CPA Global provides us with certain patent management services. On February 7, 2017, CPA Global claimed that we owe CPA Global approximately $0.2 million for certain patent maintenance services rendered. CPA Global has not filed claims against us in connection with this allegation. A liability of approximately $0.2 million has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016.
On March 9, 2016, counsel for Edge BioSystems, Inc. (“EdgeBio”) sent a demand letter on behalf of EdgeBio to us in connection with the terms of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement dated September 8, 2015 (the “EdgeBio Agreement”). EdgeBio alleges, among other things, that certain customers of EdgeBio erroneously remitted payments to us, that such payments should have been paid to EdgeBio and that we failed to remit these funds to EdgeBio in violation of the terms of the EdgeBio Agreement. On September 13, 2016, we received a demand for payment letter from EdgeBio’s counsel alleging that the balance due to EdgeBio is approximately $0.1 million. A liability of approximately $0.1 million has been recorded and is reflected in accrued expenses at December 31, 2016.
On February 17, 2017, Jesse Campbell (“Campbell”) filed a lawsuit individually and on behalf of others similarly situated against us in the District Court for the District of Nebraska alleging we have a materially incomplete and misleading proxy relating to a potential merger and that the merger agreement’s deal protection provisions deter superior offers.  As a result, he alleges that we have violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereafter.  Although we intend to defend the lawsuit, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this case. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, we are unable to estimate the amount of loss, or range of possible loss, at this time that may result from this action. In the event that a settlement is reached related to these matters, the amount of such settlement may be material to our results of operations and financial condition and may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.
