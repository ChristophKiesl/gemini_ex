IN GENERAL
 
Lash, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 14, 2009, and had acquired mineral properties located in the Thunder Bay mining district, Province of Ontario, Canada but had not determined whether these properties contain reserves that are economically recoverable. 
 
On September 21, 2012, the Company received its 2012 Soil Sampling Program report for soil sampling for the Mobert Property. The report, prepared by Fladgate Exploration Consulting Corporation, confirmed that soil samples were taken from the Mobert Property. The report states, in relevant part:
 
"B-horizon soil sampling was planned over roughly one quarter of the Property. A grid was created consisting of eleven lines spaced 100m apart, with a total of 141 planned samples spaced at 25m. Eight samples were unable to be taken due to ground conditions, leaving 133 samples taken in total.
 
All samples were prepared and analysed through Accurassay Laboratories, located in Thunder Bay, Ontario. All samples sent for analyses are dried at 60°C and subjected to a jaw crusher, proceeding afterwards through an 80-mesh sieve. Samples were analysed for gold, and the Accurassay procedure ALFA3 was selected for fire assay and ICP finish, with minimal sample needed (30g). Detection limits for ALFA3 range from 3 – 10,000ppb.
 
Results from the 2012 soil sampling program are pending."

We were conducting mineral exploration activities in order to assess whether they contained any commercially exploitable mineral reserves. As of June 30, 2015, we ceased our exploration operations in the Thunder Bay mining district due to a lack of funds, but maintained our plan as a mining exploration company, seeking other mining properties to explore and asses for economic potential.
 
We have never earned any revenues.
 
Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
