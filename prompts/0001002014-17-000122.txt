ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
 
Hunt Mining Corp. (the "Company" or "Hunt"), is a mineral exploration company incorporated on January 10, 2006 under the laws of Alberta, Canada and, together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the exploration of mineral properties in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.
 
Effective November 6, 2013, the Company continued from the Province of Alberta to the Province of British Columbia.  The Company's registered office is located at 25th Floor, 700 West Georgia Street, Vancouver,  B.C.  V7Y 1B3.  The Company's head office is located at 23800 E Appleway Avenue, Liberty Lake, Washington, 99019 USA.
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the following subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances:
 

Corporation | Incorporation | Percentage ownership | Business Purpose 
----------------------------+-----------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------
Cerro Cazador S.A. ("CSSA") | Argentina | 100% | Holder of Assets and Exploration Company
Ganadera Patagonia SRL | Argentina | 40% | Land Holding Company 
1494716 Alberta Ltd. | Alberta, Canada | 100% | Nominee Shareholder 
Hunt Gold USA LLC | Washington, USA | 100% | Management Company 

 
The Company's activities include the exploration of mineral properties in Argentina. On the basis of information to date, the Company has not yet determined whether the exploration properties contain economically recoverable ore reserves. The underlying value of the mineral properties is entirely dependent upon the existence of economically recoverable reserves, the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete development and upon future profitable production or a sale of these properties.
 
Geographic and Segment Information
 
We have one reportable segment, consisting of evaluation, acquisition and exploration activities which are focused principally in Argentina. We evaluate, acquire, and explore for advanced silver and gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to silver and gold production or value adding strategic transactions. We reported no operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015. Geographic location of mineral properties and plant and equipment is provided in Item 2 – Properties and Notes 7 and 9 – Mineral Properties and Property and Equipment to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the section heading "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" below.
Reclamation
 
We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.

 Government Regulation
 
Our exploration and development activities and other property interests are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, Argentina, and other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The Company is not aware of any current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
Environmental Regulation
 
Our projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, or what additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects. During 2015, none of our project sites had any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations.
Competition
 
 The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for silver and gold mineral deposits. We are a very early stage mineral exploration company and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. There is competition for the limited number of silver and gold acquisition and exploration opportunities, some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources than we have. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive silver and gold projects at reasonable prices. We use consultants and compete with other mining companies for the man hours of consulting time required to complete our studies. We also compete with other mining companies for mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry and for exploration and development services.
Metals Market Overview
 
We are an emerging precious metals exploration company with silver and gold mining properties in Argentina. Descriptions of the markets for these metals are provided below.
Silver Market
 
Silver has traditionally served as a medium of exchange, much like gold. Silver's strength, malleability, ductility, thermal and electrical conductivity, sensitivity to light and ability to endure extreme changes in temperature combine to make it a widely used industrial metal. While silver continues to be used as a form of investment and a financial asset, the principal uses of silver are industrial, primarily in electrical and electronic components, photography, jewelry, silverware, batteries, computer chips, electrical contacts, and high technology printing. Silver's anti-bacterial properties also make it valuable for use in medicine and in water purification. Additionally, the use of silver in the photovoltaic and solar panel industries is growing rapidly, and new uses of silver are being developed in connection with the use of superconductive wire and radio frequency identification devices.
 
Most silver product is obtained from mining in which silver is not the principal or primary product. The Silver Institute, an international silver industry association, noted that for 2014 only around 31% of output came from so-called primary silver mines, where silver is the main source of revenue. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated on the London Fix high and low silver fixes in U.S. dollars per troy ounce.
 

Silver | Year | High | Low 
-------+--------+--------+-------
 | 2010 | $30.70 | $15.14
 | 2011 | $48.70 | $26.16
 | 2012 | $37.23 | $26.67
 | 2013 | $32.23 | $18.61
 | 2014 | $22.05 | $15.28
 | 2015 | $18.23 | $13.71
 | 2016 | $20.71 | $13.58
 | 2017 * | $18.34 | $15.95

Gold Market
 
Gold has two main categories of use: fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. The supply of gold consists of a combination of production from mining and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. The following table sets forth for the periods indicated on the London Fix PM high and low gold fixes in U.S. dollars per troy ounce.

Gold | Year | High | Low 
-----+------+--------+-------
 | 2010 | $1,420 | $1,058
 | 2011 | $1,895 | $1,319
 | 2012 | $1,792 | $1,540
 | 2013 | $1,694 | $1,192
 | 2014 | $1,385 | $1,142
 | 2015 | $1,296 | $1,049
 | 2016 | $1,366 | $1,077
 | 2017 | $1,258 | $1,151

Employees
 
As at December 31, 2016, we had 30 full and part time employees and 4 individuals working on a consulting basis. Our operations are managed by our officers with input from our directors. We engage geological, metallurgical, and engineering consultants from time to time as required to assist in evaluating our property interests and recommending and conducting work programs. The increase in the number of employees and consultants during 2016 was due to the purchase of the Mina Martha property and activity to refurbish the mill and camp.
