     General Development of Business
     AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres primarily located in the United States and Europe. Holdings is an indirect subsidiary of Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (“Wanda”), a Chinese private conglomerate.
     On March 31, 2016, AMC Entertainment Inc. (“AMCE”) merged with and into Holdings, its direct parent company. In connection with the merger, Holdings assumed all of the obligations of AMCE pursuant to the indentures to the 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 (“Notes due 2022”), the 5.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2025 (“Notes due 2025”) and the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2013 (as subsequently amended).
     As of December 31, 2016, Wanda owned approximately 68.83% of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and 86.88% of the combined voting power of Holdings’ outstanding common stock and has the power to control Holdings’ affairs and policies, including with respect to the election of directors (and, through the election of directors, the appointment of management), entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions.
     On November 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) for cash and stock. The purchase price for Odeon was $637,073,000, comprised of cash of $480,338,000 and 4,536,466 shares of Class A common stock with a fair value of $156,735,000 (based on a closing sale price of $34.55 per share on November 29, 2017). In addition, we repaid indebtedness of Odeon of $593,173,000 at closing. As of the acquisition date, Odeon operated 242 theatres with 2,243 screens in four major markets: United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany; and three smaller markets: Austria, Portugal and Ireland.

We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay the aggregate principal amount of Bridge Loan (defined herein) of $350,000,000. 
     On February 17, 2017, we completed an additional public offering of 1,283,255 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $31.50 per share ($40,423,000), resulting in net proceeds of $39,000,000, pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters.

     Financial Information about Segments
     Beginning with our Odeon acquisition in 2016, we identified two reportable segments for our theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. Our International markets segment is new this year as a result of the Odeon acquisition. For information about our operating segments, see Note 15 - Operating Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Narrative Description of Business
     We are the world’s largest theatrical exhibition company and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. Over the course of our nearly 100 year history, we have pioneered many of the theatrical exhibition industry’s most important innovations. We introduced Multiplex theatres in the 1960s and the North American stadium-seated Megaplex theatre format in the 1990s. Most recently, we revolutionized movie-going with the deployment of our theatre renovations featuring plush, powered recliner seating. Our growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth through reinvestment in our existing assets and through the acquisition of some of the most respected companies in the theatrical exhibition industry.
     The combination of AMC, Odeon and Carmike makes us the largest theatre operator in the world with 906 theatres and 10,558 screens in eight countries as of December 31, 2016. We are the #1 theatre operator in the United States, the #1 theatre operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy and Spain; the #2 theatre operator in Austria and Portugal; and the #4 theatre operator in Germany. We have operations in four of the world’s ten largest economies, including four of the five largest European economies (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany). Additionally the combined company is the largest global procurer in theatrical exhibition of film, food and beverage items, lighting and theatre supplies.
     As of December 31, 2016, we owned, operated or held interests in 660 theatres with a total of 8,293 screens in the United States and 246 theatres and 2,265 screens in European markets. With operations in 44 states, approximately 52% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of one of our theatres. We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles, which we believe gives our circuit a unique profile and offers strategic and operational advantages. We operate productive theaters in the top markets in the United States and have #1 or #2 market share in the top three markets: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Our top five markets, in each of which we hold the #1 or #2 share position, are New York (45% share), Los Angeles (26%), Chicago (42%), Philadelphia (29%) and Dallas (30%). Strategically, these markets and our theatres in them are diverse, operationally complex and, in many cases, the scarcity of new theatre opportunities creates a significant competitive advantage for established locations against newcomers or alternative entertainment options.
     Our theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and theatre food and beverage sales. We offer consumers a broad range of entertainment alternatives including traditional film programming, independent and foreign films, performing arts, music and sports. We also offer food and beverage alternatives beyond traditional concession items, including made-to-order meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, beer, wine, premium cocktails and dine-in theatre options. The balance of our revenues is generated from ancillary sources, including on‑screen advertising, fees earned from our AMC Stubs® customer loyalty program, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, and on‑line ticketing fees.
     Approximately 360 million consumers have attended the legacy AMC, Odeon and Carmike theatre circuits, combined for the year ended December 31, 2016. Legacy AMC theatres comprise all AMC theatres owned or in operation prior to the purchase of Odeon and Carmike. 
     As a result of our ongoing focus to improve the quality of the movie-going experience, legacy AMC theatres continue to maintain leading top-box customer satisfaction scores of greater than 60% and industry leading theatre productivity metrics. Over the period from the beginning of 2011 to December 31, 2016, we believe we have invested more than our most comparable peers and believe our investments are yielding higher rates of return. According to publicly available information for our most comparable peers in the U.S. market, for the year ended December 31, 2016,

our U.S. markets circuit led or nearly led in revenues per patron ($15.16), food and beverage per patron ($4.82), and average ticket price ($9.59). We believe that it is the quality of our theatre locations and our customer‑focused innovation that continue to drive improved productivity per location (which we measure as increases in admissions revenues per screen relative to the industry and/or food and beverage revenues per patron).
     We continually upgrade the quality of our theatre circuit through substantial renovations featuring our seating concepts, acquisitions, new builds (including expansions), expansion of food and beverage offerings (including dine‑in theatres) and by disposing of older screens through closures and sales. We are an industry leader in the development and operation of theatres.
     To ensure that we are an imaginative and bold innovator today and in the years ahead, we have established the following key priorities.
     •Through world-class marketing programs we plan to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential guests, to drive more attendance and increase market share. Our focus is to capture guests’ attention before they even leave their homes-by paying close attention to our brands, our loyalty program and our communication with movie-goers via the internet, either directly or through social media;
     •We have a keen focus on the quality of on‑screen presentation and programing content. We plan to continue investing in technical innovation that will allow us to enhance the consumer experience through premium formats such as IMAX®, Dolby Cinema™, 3D and other premium format offerings. Additionally, in recognizing the varied tastes of our guests we will continue to explore offerings of alternative content such as live concerts, sporting events, Broadway shows, opera and other non‑traditional programming to provide incremental revenue;
     •We expect to quicken the pace of deploying our proven theatre innovations while simultaneously developing new concepts and initiatives that will elevate the movie-going experience at our theatres;
     •We are committed to deploying new technologies that will allow us to prosper and thrive even as consumers look to other ways to watch movies;
     •We plan for our growth to be driven through our guest‑focused strategy and profitable acquisitions. We believe that acquisitions offer us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders;
     •Studios, film makers and other institutions of the movie industry, whether in Hollywood or abroad, are valued partners with whom we must have cooperative and productive relationships; and
     •We will continue to motivate our associates by generating pride in their employment at AMC. Because so much of our guest satisfaction is determined by the service delivery of our theatre teams, taking good care of our associates should translate in turn to their taking good care of our guests.
     We believe that our size, reputation, financial performance, history of innovation, strong major market presence and highly productive theatre circuit positions us well for the future-a future where we believe the quality of the movie going experience will drive long term, sustainable success. It is our belief that our innovation and guest-centered strategic focus can transform other theatre circuits as well, and as such, our future growth will also include strategic acquisitions. We are constantly improving the quality of the movie-going experience in ways that we believe will increase attendance and capture a greater proportion of total movie-going spending in order to maximize the economic potential of each customer visit, create sustainable growth and deliver shareholder value.
     We plan to continue investing in our theatres and upgrading the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through an array of improved and differentiated customer experiences in (1) more comfort and convenience; (2) food and beverage; (3) engagement and loyalty; (4) sight and sound; and (5) targeted programming. The following table provides detail with respect to the geographic location of our theatrical exhibition circuit as of December 31, 2016:

      We were founded in 1920 and since then have pioneered many of the theatrical exhibition industry’s most important innovations. In addition, we have acquired some of the most respected companies in the theatrical exhibition industry, including Loews, General Cinema, Kerasotes, Starplex Cinemas, Odeon and Carmike. Our historic growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth and acquisition strategies, in addition to strategic alliances and partnerships that highlight our ability to capture innovation and value beyond the traditional exhibition space. For example:
    
· | In March 2005, we formed a joint venture with Regal Entertainment Group (“Regal”) and combined our respective cinema screen advertising businesses into a company called National CineMedia, LLC (“NCM”). In July 2005, Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (“Cinemark”) joined NCM by contributing its cinema screen advertising business and, together with us and Regal, became “Founding Members” of NCM. As of December 31, 2016, we owned 23,862,988 common units in NCM, or a 17.40% ownership interest in NCM. All of our NCM membership units are redeemable for, at the option of NCM, cash or shares of common stock of National CineMedia, Inc. (“NCM, Inc.”), on a share-for-share basis. In December 2015, we elected to exchange 200,000 NCM membership units for 200,000 common shares of NCM, Inc. The estimated fair value of our units in NCM and our common shares of NCM, Inc. was approximately $354.4 million based on the closing price per share of NCM, Inc. on December 31, 2016, of $14.73 per share. NCM operates an in-theatre digital network in the United States. NCM’s primary activities that impact our theatres include advertising through its branded “First Look” pre-feature entertainment program, lobby promotions and displays. See Note 5 - Investments under Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our required divestiture of our investment in NCM in connection with the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas and other information related to this investment.

· | We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCM’s network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience. We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network. In addition, we are entitled to receive mandatory quarterly distributions of excess cash from NCM.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In March 2011, we announced the launch of an innovative distribution company called Open Road Films, LLC (“Open Road Films”) along with another major theatrical exhibition chain. Open Road Films is a dynamic acquisition-based domestic theatrical distribution company that concentrates on wide-release movies. Their first film, Killer Elite, was released in September 2011 and in 2015 the Open Road release Spotlight won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Releases during calendar 2016 include Fifty Shades of Black, Triple, Mother’s Day, Gleason, Snowden, Max Steel and Bleed for This.

· | In December 2013, NCM spun-off its Fathom Events business to a newly formed limited liability company AC JV, LLC (“AC JV”), owned 32% by each of the Founding Members and 4% by NCM. AC JV focuses exclusively on alternative content programming, including live and pre-recorded concerts, sporting events and other non-film entertainment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We hold a 29% interest in Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, LLC (“DCIP”), a joint venture charged with implementing digital cinema in our theatres, which has allowed us to substantially complete our planned digital deployments. Future digital cinema developments will be managed by DCIP, subject to certain approvals.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We own a 14.6% interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (“DCDC”), a joint venture with certain other exhibitors and film distributors. DCDC was formed to develop a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content. As of December 31, 2016, 601 of our theatre locations are equipped to receive content via the DCDC network.

      We have created and invested in a number of allied businesses and strategic initiatives that have created differentiated viewing formats and experiences, greater variety in food and beverage options and value appreciation for AMC. We believe these initiatives will continue to generate incremental value for us in the future. For example:
    
· | To complement our deployment of digital technology, in 2006 we partnered with RealD to install its 3D enabled systems in our theatres. As of December 31, 2016, we had 5,070 3D screens, including 82 proprietary large format (“PLF”) screens and 196 IMAX® screens that are 3D enabled. During the year ended December 31, 2016, 3D films licensed by us in the U.S. have generated approximately 41% greater admissions revenue per person than the standard 2D versions of the same film, or approximately $3.71 additional revenue per ticket.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | IMAX® is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX® offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest-quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX® brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX® theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as such, IMAX’s theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As of December 31, 2016, AMC is the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S. with a 51% market share, and each of our IMAX® local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity. As of December 31, 2016, our IMAX® screen count is 100% greater than our closest competitor. We believe we have had considerable success with our IMAX® partnership, and in June 2016, we announced an agreement to expand the number of IMAX® screens in our U.S. theatres to 185 by the end of 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Dolby Cinema™ at AMC. In May 2015, we partnered with Dolby Laboratories, Inc. to unveil a premium cinema offering for movie-goers that combined state-of-the-art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema™ at AMC includes Dolby Vision™ laser projection and object oriented Dolby Atmos audio technology, as well as AMC’s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As of December 31, 2016, we have 48 fully operational Dolby Cinema™ at AMC screens. In August 2016, we announced the acceleration of our Dolby Cinema™ at AMC deployment. We expect to have 100 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums operational by the end of 2017 and we expect to have 160 operational by the end of 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Prime at AMC. We believe there is considerable opportunity to add a private label PLF format in many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. This PLF format will give AMC the capability to add a screen in theatres already
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

outfitted with IMAX® and/or Dolby Cinema™ at AMC. Also, this PLF should offer an enhanced theatrical experience for movie-goers beyond AMC’s current core theatres, but may not carry the same price premium as IMAX® or Dolby Cinema™ at AMC nor will there be any sharing of revenue like our arrangements with IMAX® and Dolby Cinema™. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price sensitive markets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our tickets are currently on sale over the Internet at the AMC website, Atom Tickets, Fandango®, Movietickets.com® and Flixster®. During calendar 2016, our Internet and mobile app ticketing services sold approximately 54 million tickets for us. We believe there is additional upside in our future Internet ticketing service alliances which would provide consumers with mobile ticketing applications and integration with our digital marketing programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Consistent with our history and culture of innovation, we believe we have pioneered a new way of thinking about theatrical exhibition: as a consumer entertainment provider. This vision, which introduces a strategic and marketing overlay to traditional theatrical exhibition, has been instrumental in driving and redirecting our future strategy.
     The following table provides detail with respect to digital delivery, 3D enabled projection, large screen formats, such as IMAX® and our proprietary Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, other PLF screens, enhanced food and beverage offerings and our premium seating as deployed throughout our circuit on December 31, 2016:
    
Format | Theatres | Screens
Digital | 906 | 10,558 
3D enabled (includes IMAX,and PLF) | 906 | 5,070

      Our Strategy
     Through most of its history, movie-going has been defined by product - the movies themselves. Yet, we believe long term significant, sustainable changes in the economics of the business and attendance patterns have been driven by improvements to the movie-going experience, not the temporary ebb and flow of product.
     We are committed to maintaining a leadership position in the exhibition industry by focusing on forward thinking initiatives for the benefit of our guests. Improving the guest experience remains at our core and is now supported by three strategic elements:  1) Enhance, 2) Engage and 3) Expand. Consistent with our history and culture of innovation, we believe our vision and relentless focus on these three elements, which apply strategic and marketing components to traditional theatrical exhibition, will drive our future success.
    
1) | Enhance
---+--------

      We plan to continue investing in our theatres and enhancing the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through more and faster deployment of comfort and convenience innovations, imaginative food and beverage initiatives, and exciting PLF offerings. 
     Recognizing the success of our proven theatre innovations, we expect to quicken the pace of deployment while simultaneously leveraging new technology to develop new concepts and initiatives that will elevate the movie-going experience at our theatres.
     Comfort and Convenience Innovations - Recliner seating is the key feature of our theatre renovations. We believe that maximizing comfort and convenience for our customers will be increasingly necessary to maintain and improve our relevance. These renovations, in conjunction with capital contributions from our landlords, involve stripping theatres to their basic structure in order to replace finishes throughout, upgrade the sight and sound experience, install modernized points of sale and, most importantly, replace traditional theatre seats with plush, electric recliners that allow customers to deploy a leg rest and fully recline at the push of a button. The renovation process typically involves 

 
  10

 
losing up to two-thirds of a given auditorium’s seating capacity. For an industry historically focused on quantity, this reduction in seating capacity could be viewed as counter-intuitive and harmful to revenues. However, the quality improvement in the customer experience is driving a 40% to 60% increase in attendance at these locations in their first year post renovation. Our customers have responded favorably to the significant personal space gains from ample row depths, ability to recline or stretch their legs, extra-wide pillowed chaise and oversized armrests. The reseated theatres attract more midweek audiences than normal theatres and tend to draw more adults who pay higher ticket prices than teens or young children. We typically do not change ticket prices in the first year after renovation, however, in subsequent years we typically increase our ticket prices by amounts well in excess of price adjustments for our non‑renovated theatres.
     We plan to continue investing in our theatres and upgrading the consumer experience to take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through an array of improved and differentiated customer experiences. These experiences include greater engagement and loyalty through world class marketing, a keen focus on the quality of on-screen presentation and programming content, more and faster deployment of comfort and convenience and food and beverage initiatives, all while developing and utilizing new technologies across these platforms for the benefit of our consumers.
     We also plan to continue growing through profitable acquisitions. We believe that acquisitions offer us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders.
     As of December 31, 2016, we now feature recliner seating in approximately 190 theatres, including Dine-in-Theatres, totaling approximately 1,984 screens and representing approximately 35% of total legacy AMC screens. By the end of 2017 and 2018, we expect legacy AMC theatres to operate 2,650 and 3,350 screens with recliner seating, respectively. Based on feedback from our guests, we believe there is universal appeal for the ample space, comfort and convenience of our powered recliners, and that appeal will translate into additional attendance in new markets both domestically and in Europe. As such, deploying powered recliners will be an integral strategy in the former Carmike and Odeon circuits going forward as we are targeting approximately 42% of our total screens to be comprised of screens with recliner seating by the end of 2021.
     We are currently testing new recliner seat designs and innovations that will continue to provide guests with an improved level of comfort and convenience while optimizing the number of seats available for guests post renovation. Reducing the number of seats removed during renovation, would expand the number of theatres we could renovate, allowing us to introduce our guest centered amenities to more movie-goers.
     Rebalancing of the new supply-and-demand relationship created by recliner seating presents us two further opportunities to improve customer convenience and maximize operating results: open-source internet ticketing and reserved seating.
     Open-source internet ticketing makes legacy AMC’s entire universe of seats (over 820,000 as of December 31, 2016), for all our show times, as available as possible, on as many websites and mobile applications as possible. This is a significant departure from the years prior to 2012, when tickets to any one of our theatres were only available on one website. We most recently deployed new technology by partnering with Atom Tickets to allow guests to utilize Atom’s mobile movie ticketing platform to purchase our tickets. Atom’s technology allows movie-goers to check movie reviews and AMC show times, coordinate movie outings among friends while allowing them to pay separately, and pre‑pay for concession items. Our tickets are currently on sale over the internet, either directly or through mobile apps, at our own website and app and Fandango®, Movietickets.com®, Flixster® and Atom Tickets. We believe increased online access is important because it captures customers’ purchase intent more immediately and directly than if we wait for their arrival at the theatre box office to make a purchase. Carefully monitoring internet pre-sales also lets us adjust capacity in real time, moving movies that are poised to over perform to larger capacity auditoriums or more additional auditoriums, thereby maximizing yield.
     Reserved seating, at some of legacy AMC’s busiest theatres, and now available at all of legacy AMC’s Manhattan, New York City locations, allows our customers to choose a specific seat in advance of the movie. We believe that knowing there is a specifically chosen seat waiting for a show that promises to be a sellout is comforting to our customers, reduces anxiety around the experience and compels ticket purchases. We believe reserved seating will become increasingly prevalent to the point of being a prerequisite in the medium-term future.

     We believe the comfort and personal space gains from recliner seating, coupled with the immediacy of demand captured from open-source internet ticketing and the appeal of reserved seating make a powerful economic combination for us.
 Imaginative Food and Beverage Initiatives - The acceleration of initiative deployment also applies to food and beverage enhancements. To address recent consumer trends, we are expanding our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include made-to-order drinks and meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks and other gourmet products. We plan to invest across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital‑intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine‑in theatre options.
 Leading the charge are our MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (“MacGuffins”) which give us a fresh opportunity to engage our over-21 customers. We believe that few innovations have won over the adult movie goer more decisively than our full service bars featuring premium beers, wines and liquors. Extremely versatile in design with a significant impact on theatre economics, MacGuffins is our fastest growing idea in the enhanced food and beverage space. As of December 31, 2016, we offer alcohol in approximately 178 legacy AMC theatres and when combined with the former Carmike theatres that serve alcohol, we expect to increase that number to approximately 275 by the end of 2017. We believe there is ample opportunity to introduce premium beers, wines and liquors throughout the former Carmike and Odeon circuits, and we would like to install our MacGuffins concept in as many theatres globally as we can. We will continue to work with state and local officials in the United States, and the necessary officials in Europe to expand the number of theatres with this appealing amenity. Due to our success in operating MacGuffins, we believe we can leverage our substantial experience when it comes to permitting, installing and commissioning these improvements.
     Coca Cola Freestyle® puts customers in charge with over 140 drink flavor options in a technologically advanced compact footprint. Our operational excellence and history of innovation rewarded us with first-mover advantage on this new technology, which, as of December 31, 2016, was deployed in substantially all legacy AMC theatres. This technology improves the guest experience, shortens lines in our concession areas and allows for more efficient staffing. We expect to install Coca Cola Freestyle® machines in 100% of AMC’s domestic theatres, including all former Carmike theatres, by the end of 2017, and we have already begun the rollout at the Odeon theatres.
     Our commitment to participate in new technologies is evident in the recent testing of new food and beverage functionality for our new website and mobile apps. In our reserved seat auditoriums, our innovative new service allows for advance online ordering of concession items with an advance ticket order that is then delivered to the guest’s seat at a specified time of the guest’s choosing. Initial results are encouraging, and we could expect a broad rollout of this innovation in U.S. theatres over the next three to nine months. We are currently evaluating system compatibility and mobile application functionality to determine timing for deployment in Europe.
     The successful implementation of these initiatives has resonated with our guests and led to increases in ticket sales, revenue, cash flow and shareholder value. This is demonstrated by an increased take-rate for our food and beverage offerings. The number of guests at legacy AMC theatres who are choosing to purchase a beverage or food item has increased from 64% of our attendance in 2011 to approximately 71% in 2016. We believe that focusing on improving the guest experience offers universal appeal whether domestically or internationally, and as such, we intend to leverage our organic growth through strategic acquisitions like Carmike and Odeon for the benefit of millions of new AMC movie-goers.
     Exciting Premium Large Format Offerings - Our business is a visual and aural medium requiring a keen focus on the quality of on-screen presentation and programing content to ensure success. PLF auditoriums generate our highest customer satisfaction scores, and we believe the investment in premium formats increases the value of the movie-going experience for our guests, ultimately leading to additional ticket revenue. To that end we are committed to investing in and expanding our offerings of the best sight and sound experiences through a combination of our partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby Cinema™ and the future development of our own proprietary PLF offering.
     IMAX®—IMAX® is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX® offers a unique end‑to‑end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest‑quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX® brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX® theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as such, IMAX’s theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world.

     As of December 31, 2016, legacy AMC was the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S., with 178 (3D enabled) IMAX® screens including 27 IMAX® screens from our Carmike acquisition and a 51% market share. Each one of our IMAX® local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity, and as of December 31, 2016, our IMAX® screen count was 100% greater than our closest competitor. Based on the continued success of our IMAX® partnership, in June 2016, legacy AMC announced an agreement to expand the number of IMAX® screens in our U.S. theatres to 185 by the end of 2019, further reinforcing our position as the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S. We also added 18 IMAX® screens in Europe as a part of our Odeon acquisition. We will also expand our IMAX® relationship into former Carmike and Odeon theatres as we integrate both circuits, further strengthening our position as the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S. and making us the largest IMAX® distributor in the United Kingdom and Europe.
     Dolby Cinema™ at AMC— Dolby Cinema™ at AMC was introduced to AMC guests in May 2015, when we partnered with Dolby Laboratories, Inc., to unveil a premium cinema offering for movie-goers that combined state‑of‑the‑art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema™ at AMC includes Dolby Vision™ laser projection and object‑oriented Dolby Atmos® audio technology, as well as AMC’s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen.
     In August 2016, we announced the acceleration of our Dolby Cinema™ at AMC deployment and as of December 31, 2016, we operated 48 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums. The legacy AMC circuit expects to have 160 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums operational by the end of 2018. We expect to expand deployment of our innovative Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums into former Carmike and Odeon locations as we integrate both circuits.
     Prime at AMC—We believe there is considerable opportunity to add a private label PLF experience to many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. This proprietary PLF auditorium will be branded Prime at AMC and is expected to offer an enhanced theatrical experience for movie-goers beyond our current core theatres, but may not carry the same price premium as IMAX® or Dolby Cinema™ at AMC. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price sensitive markets. We expect to launch our first Prime at AMC auditorium in March 2017.
    
2) | Engage
---+-------

      Utilizing World Class Marketing - AMC is engaging moviegoers with world-class and industry-leading marketing activities to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential customers that drive both growth and loyalty.  This effort begins with the legacy AMC loyalty program, AMC Stubs®, which we believe is one of the most popular loyalty programs in the industry. AMC Stubs® is a customer loyalty program which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members‑only offerings and services. In July 2016, we completed a national relaunch of our AMC Stubs® loyalty program featuring both a traditional paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere™ and a new non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider™. Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC theatres. The AMC Stubs Insider™ tier rewards guests for simply coming to the movies, and benefits include free refills on certain food items, discount ticket offers, a birthday gift and 20 reward points earned for every dollar spent. For a $15 annual membership fee, AMC Stubs Premiere™ members enjoy express service with specially marked shorter lines at the box office and concession stand, free size upgrades on certain food and beverage items, discount ticket offers, a birthday gift, discounted online ticketing fees and 100 points for every dollar spent. Some of the rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations.
     As of June 30, 2016, prior to our national relaunch, we had 2,672,000 active member households in the AMC Stubs® program. As of December 31 2016, we had more than 5,263,000 active member households enrolled in both the AMC Stubs Premiere™ and AMC Stubs Insider™ programs, combined. New members are enrolling in the new AMC Stubs® program at a rate greater than 11 times the number of enrollments during the same period in 2015. Our AMC Stubs® members represented approximately 23% of legacy AMC attendance during the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect the number of member households to double over the next 24 to 36 months. We believe movie-goers want to be recognized and rewarded for attending our theatres and as a result, our new AMC Stubs® program is designed to strengthen guest loyalty, attract new guests and drive additional return visits. Our much larger database of identified moviegoers also provides us with additional insight into our customers’ movie preferences, and this enables us to have both a larger and a more targeted marketing effort to support our Hollywood studio partners. We intend to creatively mine this rapidly growing consumer database to increase sales and otherwise boost loyalty to AMC.
    
 
  13

 

 Movie-goers will be able to enroll in the AMC Stubs® program and earn loyalty rewards at the former Carmike theatres as we convert former Carmike point of sale systems to AMC systems. We expect those conversions to be completed during the second quarter of 2017.
     Odeon currently has loyalty programs in all the major territories in which it operates. Odeon movie-goers can earn points for spending money at the theatre, and those points can be redeemed for tickets and concession items at a later date. Odeon currently has more than three million active members in these various loyalty programs. We are currently evaluating the Odeon loyalty programs to determine how best to reward our European movie-goers and heighten guest loyalty to drive additional attendance to Odeon theatres.
     Our marketing efforts are not limited to our loyalty program as we seek to improve our customer connections. Given the high degree of acceptance by consumers to interacting with companies through their website and apps, legacy AMC introduced an all-new website and mobile application in 2016. The new website and app are designed to offer a more graphically rich interface, feature more robust content and improve functionality. We believe our new website and mobile application provide users with an improved online experience where they can more easily find information about movies, theatres and amenities and seamlessly purchase tickets and concessions online.
     The competitive advantage of a robust and easy‑to‑use online and mobile presence combined with an effective loyalty program that provides better market intelligence to anticipate customer’s future behavior should allow us to capture incremental share of both entertainment dollars and time. 
     Additionally, to align guest expectations and cost structures across the broader U.S. platform comprised of legacy AMC and former Carmike theatres, on March 1, 2017 we announced a differentiated multi-brand strategy.  
     During 2017, all Carmike theatres will be re-branded to be part of the AMC theatres. Every AMC location will operate under one of the following AMC brands: 
    
· | AMC Theatres – AMC Amazing. Approximately 400 theatres, located primarily in larger, more urban markets, offering the AMC amazing experience through amenities such as recliner seating, MacGuffins bars, and PLF auditoriums like IMAX® at AMC, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, and AMC’s new proprietary PLF, “Prime at AMC.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AMC Classic Theatres – America’s Hometown Theatres. Approximately 200 theatres, located primarily in smaller mid-sized and suburban markets, offering fun, friendly, amenities guests can depend on for a great movie-going experience with value in mind. These theatres will offer Coca-Cola Freestyle® machines and menu items like pretzel bites, movie nachos, and refillable annual popcorn buckets. Some AMC Classic theatres may include MacGuffins bars and Prime at AMC PLF auditoriums. The brand logo for AMC Classic incorporates the folded “C” graphical element from the legacy Carmike brand logo while adopting Carmike’s “America’s Hometown Theatres” tagline. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AMC Dine-In Theatres – Movies with a Menu. Approximately 60 locations, equipped with full kitchens and MacGuffins full bars, will offer great experiences including full-service dining as well as delivery-to-seat and/or express-pick up of AMC’s menu and beverage offerings. Guests can enjoy a variety of fresh, hand-crafted menu items that rival anything they’d find at their local restaurant, as well as an exciting array of drinks and desserts - all from the comfort of their seat while taking in the latest film.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The new branding strategy is just one example of how we intend to extend our world class marketing strengths, including our loyalty program and our robust, easy‑to‑use online and mobile presence across our larger footprint as we work to integrate our recent acquisitions. We also expect to retain some of the existing guest engagement and marketing programs currently utilized at both Carmike and Odeon to further bond with our guests.
     Target Programming - Our fundamental business, historically and now, revolves around the theatrical exhibition of Hollywood movies. If a movie is commercially available, it is likely to be playing at an AMC theatre today or tonight, because we schedule shows in the morning, afternoon and even at midnight or later, just to make sure it is convenient for our customers.
    
 
  14

 

 Increasingly, we are playing movies and other content originating from more sources. We believe that as diversity grows in the United States, the United Kingdom and in Europe, the ability to adapt and target programming for a fragmented audience will become critical. We believe this is something we already focus on.
     For movies targeted at diverse audiences, legacy AMC theatres frequently experience attendance levels greater than our average, national market share. Legacy AMC theatres have a strong Bollywood following with more than 60 locations serving diaspora audiences. During the year ended December 31, 2016, legacy AMC theatres exhibited 125 popular Indian movies which generated approximately $18 million of box office revenue.
     Through AMC Independent™, we have also reached into the independent production and distribution community. Growing quickly from our inception five years ago, legacy AMC theatres played 249 films (excluding community programming and film festivals) during the year ended December 31, 2016 from this very creative community, generating $76 million in U.S. box office revenue.
     Open Road Releasing, LLC (“Open Road Releasing”), operator of Open Road Films, our joint venture with another major exhibitor, is similarly undertaking an effort to grow our sources of content and provide access to our screens for content that may not otherwise find its way there. Open Road Films’ 2015 release Spotlight won the Academy Award for Best Picture.
     Fathom Events (“Fathom”) is another joint venture with several major exhibitors and is the recognized leader in the alternative entertainment industry, offering a variety of one of a kind entertainment events in movie theaters nationwide that include live, high definition performances of the Metropolitan Opera, the performing arts, major sporting events, music concerts, comedy series, Broadway shows, original programming featuring entertainment’s biggest stars, socially relevant documentaries with audience Q&A and much more. We are working with Fathom to further broaden our programming options to appeal to even wider audiences.
     We believe we are a vital partner for Hollywood studios and for independent distributors because we generate more box office revenue per screen and provide stronger in theatre and online promotional exposure for their movies. To that end, we are committed to working with our studio partners to further innovation, exchange ideas and discover mutually beneficial ways to expand movie-going. We are a content owner’s highest quality revenue stream, because every customer pays every time they watch the content. Among all theatres, our venues are the most valuable to content owners, and we believe their product is more productive in one of our theatres.
    
3) | Expand
---+-------

      We intend to grow through the deployment of our strategic growth initiatives as well as through profitable acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy combines discipline and purpose with a strong investment thesis for each transaction that we believe will drive value in the long term.  
     Acquisitions expand the platform, whether domestically or internationally, upon which to further deploy our proven strategic initiatives while further diversifying AMC’s consumer base, leading to greater appeal for more films. 
     The additional scale achieved through acquisitions also serves to benefit AMC through global procurement savings and increased overhead efficiencies.  
     We believe that acquisitions offer us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest focused strategies to new movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, associates, studio partners and our shareholders.
     We believe significant financial opportunities exist in our current portfolio of theatres both in the United States and in Europe, and we have a substantial pipeline of investments to exploit that offer incremental attendance-generating and revenue-generating prospects. By expanding through acquisitions and deploying building-by-building solutions from a proprietary menu of proven, customer-endorsed comfort and convenience, enhanced food and beverage, and premium sight and sound concepts, we believe we have the formula for continuing growth and success.

Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
     Leading Market Share in Important, Affluent and Diverse Markets— Across the three biggest metropolitan markets in the United States—New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, representing 19% of the country’s total box office—we hold a 36% combined market share. As of December 31, 2016, we have theatres located in 24 of the top 25 U.S. markets, holding the #1 or #2 position in 22 of those 25 markets based on box office revenue. On any given weekend, approximately one third of the top ten theatres for the #1 opening movie title in the United States are AMC theatres, according to data provided by Rentrak. We are also the #1 theatre operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy and Spain; the #2 operator in Austria and Portugal; and the #4 operator in Germany. We believe our strong presence in these top markets makes our theatres highly visible and therefore strategically more important to content providers, who rely on the large audiences and marketing momentum provided by major markets to drive opinion‑making and deliver a movie’s overall box office results.
     We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles. There are inherent complexities in effectively and efficiently serving them. In some of our more densely populated major metropolitan markets, there is also a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities. Taken together, these factors solidify our market share position. Further, our history and strong presence in these markets have created a greater opportunity to introduce our enhanced customer experience concepts and exhibit a broad array of programming and premium formats, all of which we believe drive higher levels of attendance and higher revenues at our theatres.
     The recent Carmike acquisition further diversifies our footprint with theatres located in complementary suburban and rural markets as well as in geographic areas of the United States like the southeast, where legacy AMC did not have a strong presence. Guests from different demographic and geographic profiles have different tastes in movies, and we believe by broadening our geographic base, we can help mitigate the impact of film genre volatility on our box office revenues.
     Well Located, Highly Productive Theatres—Our legacy U.S. theatres are generally located in the top retail centers across the United States. We believe this provides for long-term visibility and higher productivity, and is a key element in the success of our Enhanced Food and Beverage and More Comfort and Convenience initiatives. Our location strategy, combined with our strong major market presence and our focus on a superior customer experience, enable us to deliver industry-leading theatre-level productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2016, five of the ten highest grossing theatres in the United States were legacy AMC theatres, according to data provided by Rentrak. During the same period legacy AMC’s average total revenues per theatre was more than $8.0 million. This per unit productivity is important not only to content providers, but also to developers and landlords, for whom per location and per square foot sales numbers are critical measures. The net effect is a close relationship with the commercial real estate community, which often gives us first‑look and preferred tenant status on emerging opportunities.
     Recognizing that the former Carmike theatres we acquired in 2016, are located primarily in smaller, suburban and rural markets, we do expect our total revenues per theatre to be impacted going forward. However, in general, theatres located in smaller suburban and rural markets tend to have less competition and a lower cost structure, and we believe when combined with our innovative strategic initiatives have the potential to improve productivity.
     Many Odeon theatres share similar characteristics as legacy AMC theatres in that they tend to be located in the top retail centers in major metropolitan markets with higher visibility. We believe that deploying our proven strategic initiatives in these markets will help drive attendance and greatly improve productivity.
     Selectively Participating in a Consolidating Industry—Throughout the last two decades, AMC has been an active participant in our industry’s consolidation. In that span, we have acquired and successfully integrated Loews, General Cinema, Kerasotes, select operations of Rave Digital Media and Rave Review Cinemas, in 2015, acquired SMH Theatres, Inc. (“Starplex Cinemas”) and in 2016, acquired Odeon and Carmike. We intend to selectively pursue acquisitions in the United States and internationally where the characteristics of the location, overall market and facilities further enhance the quality of our theatre portfolio. The recently Completed Acquisitions and the proposed Nordic Acquisition are in furtherance of this strategy.
    
 
  16

 

 Additionally, our focus on improving the customer experience and our strong relationships with landlords and developers have provided opportunities to expand our footprint in existing markets by acquiring competitors’ existing theatres at the end of their lease term at little or no cost. We believe that our More Comfort and Convenience and Enhanced Food and Beverage concepts have high appeal to landlords wanting to increase traffic and sales in their retail centers. These “spot acquisitions” have given us the ability to bolster our presence in existing markets at relatively low cost and more quickly (weeks, months) as compared to new builds (months, years).
     Substantial Operating Cash Flow—For the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, legacy AMC’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled $431.7 million, $467.6 million, and $297.3 million, respectively. We believe that our strategic initiatives, highly productive theatre circuit and continued focus on cost control will enable us to generate sufficient cash flow provided by operating activities to execute our strategy, to grow our revenues, maintain our facilities, service our indebtedness and pay dividends to our stockholders.
     Experienced and Dynamic Team—Our senior management team, led by Adam Aron, President and Chief Executive Officer, has the expertise that we believe will be required to transform movie-going from a commodity to a differentiated entertainment experience. A dynamic and balanced team of executives combines long-tenured leaders in operations, real estate and finance who contributed to building AMC’s hard earned reputation for operations excellence with creative entertainment and restaurant industry executives in marketing, programming and food and beverage who bring to AMC business acumen and experience that support innovation in theatrical exhibition.
     Our senior management team has experience operating both domestic and international theatres, having at one time operated more than 100 theatres with more than 1,200 screens in 11 countries outside of the United States.
     In July 2013, we relocated our Theatre Support Center to a new, state-of-the-art facility in Leawood, Kansas. With a technology platform that provides for real-time monitoring of AMC screens across the country and a workplace conducive to collaboration and teamwork, our management team has the organization well aligned with our strategy.
     Furthermore, we believe that our people, the nearly 21,300 legacy AMC associates, constitute an essential strength of AMC. They strive to make movie-going experiences at AMC always a treat. Our auditoriums offer clear and bright projection, our food is hot and our drinks are cold. Our doors, lobbies, hallways and bathrooms are clean and we select and train our people to make smiles happen. We create events and want our customers to always feel special at an AMC theatre. This is an experience delivered approximately 200 million times a year.
     Over the past five years, we have enhanced the quality and increased the variety at our food and beverage stands, introduced in-theatre dining options in many markets, launched our industry-leading loyalty program, AMC Stubs®, and in 2015 achieved our highest ever overall ratings for top-box customer satisfaction. We feel like this is only the beginning.
     Key Strategic Shareholder—In August 2012, we were acquired by Dalian Wanda Group Co. (“Wanda”), one of the largest, privately-held conglomerates in China and post the initial public offering Wanda remains our single largest shareholder with a 68.83% ownership stake as of December 31, 2016. In addition to its core business as a prominent developer and owner of commercial real estate, Wanda also owns related businesses in entertainment, hospitality and retail. Wanda is the largest theatre exhibition operator in China through its controlling ownership interest in Wanda Cinema Line. The combined ownership and scale of AMC and Wanda Cinema Line has enabled us to enhance relationships and obtain better terms from important food and beverage, lighting and theatre supply vendors, and to expand our strategic partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby®. When our scale and Wanda’s growth are taken into account, we believe AMC is the most efficient and effective partner a content owner has. Wanda is controlled by its chairman, Mr. Jianlin Wang.
     Film Content
     Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license “first-run” films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable admissions revenues and estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. Licenses that we enter into typically state that rental fees are based on aggregate terms established prior to the opening of the picture. In certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement upon the conclusion of the picture. Under an aggregate terms formula, we pay the 

 
  17

 
distributor a specified percentage of box office gross or pay based on a scale of percentages tied to different amounts of box office gross. The settlement process allows for negotiation based upon how a film actually performs.
     During the 2016 calendar year, films licensed from our seven largest distributors based on revenues accounted for approximately 90% of our U.S. admissions revenues. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor’s films in any given year.
     Our revenues are dependent upon the timing and popularity of film releases by distributors. The most marketable films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is highly seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year.
     North American film distributors typically establish geographic film licensing zones and license on a film-by-film basis to one theatre in each zone. In film zones where we are the sole exhibitor, we obtain film licenses by selecting a film from among those offered and negotiating directly with the distributor. In competitive zones, where we compete with one or more exhibitors to secure film, distributors generally allocate their films to the exhibitors located in that area based on screen capacity, grossing potential, and licensing terms. 
     Our licenses typically state that rental fees are based on aggregate terms established prior to the opening of the picture. In certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement upon the conclusion of the picture. Under an aggregate terms formula, we pay the distributor a specified percentage of box office receipts or pay based on a scale of percentages tied to different amounts of box office gross. The settlement process allows for negotiation based upon how a film actually performs.
     Food and beverage
     Food and beverage sales are our second largest source of revenue after box office admissions. Food and beverage items traditionally include popcorn, soft drinks, candy and hot dogs. Different varieties of food and beverage items are offered at our theatres based on preferences in the particular geographic region. Our traditional food and beverage strategy emphasizes prominent and appealing food and beverage offerings designed for rapid service and efficiency, including a customer friendly self-serve experience. We design our theatres to have more food and beverage capacity to make it easier to serve larger numbers of customers. Strategic placement of large food and beverage operations within theatres increases their visibility, aids in reducing the length of lines, allows flexibility to introduce new concepts and improves traffic flow around the food and beverage stands.
     To address recent consumer trends, we are expanding our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include made-to-order drinks and meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks and other gourmet products. We plan to invest across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine-in theatre options. The costs of these conversions in some cases are partially covered by investments from the theatre landlord. We currently operate 24 Dine-In Theatres that deliver chef-inspired menus with seat-side or delivery service to luxury recliners with tables. Our recent Dine-In Theatre concepts are designed to capitalize on the latest food service trend, the fast casual eating experience.
     Coca Cola Freestyle® puts customers in charge with over 140 drink flavor options in a compact footprint. Our operational excellence and history of innovation rewarded us with first-mover advantage on this new technology, which, as of December 31, 2016, was deployed in substantially all of our legacy AMC theatres. We expect to install Coca Cola Freestyle® machines in 100% of AMC’s domestic theatres, including all former Carmike theatres, by the end of 2017, and we have already begun the rollout at the Odeon theatres.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,194 full-time and 38,179 part-time employees. Approximately 50% of our U.S. theatre employees were paid the minimum wage. We consider our employee relations to be good.

 Theatrical Exhibition Industry and Competition
     U.S. Markets
     Movie-going is embedded in the American social fabric. For over 100 years people young and old, of all races and socio-economic levels, have enjoyed the entertainment that motion pictures offer.
     In the United States, the movie exhibition business is large, stable and mature. While in any given calendar quarter the quantity and quality of movies can drive volatile results, box office revenues have generally advanced from 2011 to 2016. The industry’s best year ever, in terms of revenues, was 2016, with box office revenues of approximately $11.4 billion, an increase of approximately 2.0% from 2015 with over 1.3 billion admissions in the U.S. and Canada. The industry has set records for box office revenues in four of the last five years.
     The movie exhibition business has survived the booms and busts of economic cycles and has adapted to myriad changes in technology and customer behavior. There is great value for the entertainment dollar in movie-going, and no replacement has been invented for the escape and fun that a night at the movies represents.
     We believe the exhibition business is in the early stages of a transition. After decades of economic models driven by quantity (number of theatres, screens and seats), we believe it is the quality of the movie-going experience that will define future success. Whether through enhanced food and beverage options (Food and Beverage Kiosks, Marketplaces, Coke Freestyle®, MacGuffins or Dine-in Theatres), more comfort and convenience (recliner seating, open-source internet ticketing, reserved seating), engagement and loyalty (AMC Stubs®, open-source internet ticketing, mobile apps, social media) or sight and sound (digital projectors, 3D, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, other PLF screens or IMAX®), it is the ease of use and the amenities that these innovations bring to customers that we believe will drive sustained profitability in the years ahead. 
     International Markets
     Movie-going is a popular leisure activity with high penetration across Odeon’s key geographies. Theatre appeal has proven resilient to competition for consumer’s leisure spending and to recessionary periods and we believe we will continue to benefit from increased spending across Odeon’s markets, particularly in Spain. The European market lags the U.S. market across a number of factors, including annual spend per customer, number of IMAX® screens and screens per capita that cause us to believe that the deployment of our customer initiatives will be successful in this market. On the other hand, Odeon’s European markets are more densely populated and operate with fewer screens per 1 million of population, making the screens we acquired more valuable.
     While in any calendar year the quantity and quality of movies can drive results, theatre attendance has increased since 2012 across Odeon’s key geographies. Additionally, International markets have become increasingly important. The percentage of total box office revenues attributable to International markets increased from 69% in 2012 to 72% in 2015 and is expected to continue to increase to 75% by 2019. U.S. films generate the majority of the box office in Europe, but movie-goers in specific geographies welcome locally produced films with local actors and familiar story lines which can mitigate film genre attendance fluctuations. Box office revenues in Europe increased from 2014 to 2016, with box office revenues in 2016 totaling approximately $4.9 billion in countries in which we have a footprint as a result of the Completed Acquisitions and will have a footprint as a result of the proposed Nordic Acquisition, an increase of approximately 13.4% from 2014. Going forward, we believe we will see positive growth in theatre attendance as we deploy our proven guest centered innovations like recliner seating, enhanced food and beverage offerings and premium large format experiences throughout Odeon’s markets.

2006 | | 9,210 | | 1,406 | | | 6.55 | 5,543 | 37,765

      Based on information obtained from Rentrak, we believe that the four largest exhibitors, in terms of U.S. / Canada box office revenue (Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and Cineplex Inc.) generated approximately 65% of the box office revenues in 2016. This statistic is up from 35% in 2000 and is evidence that the theatrical exhibition business in the U.S. / Canada have been consolidating.
     Our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate. Competition is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, licensing motion pictures and finding new theatre sites. Where real estate is readily available, it is easier to open a theatre near one of our theatres, which may adversely affect operations at our theatre. However, in certain of our densely populated major metropolitan markets, we believe a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities enhances the strategic value of our existing theatres. We also believe the complexity inherent in operating in these major metropolitan markets is a deterrent to other less sophisticated competitors, protecting our market share position.
     The theatrical exhibition industry faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events, and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view and home video systems, as well as from all other forms of entertainment.
     Movie-going is a compelling consumer out-of-home entertainment experience. Movie theatres currently garner a relatively small share of overall consumer entertainment time and spend, leaving significant room for further expansion and growth in the United States. In addition, our industry benefits from available capacity to satisfy additional consumer demand without capital investment.
     Even as major studio releases have increased in 2016 following a 2013 decline, we believe smaller production and distribution companies could fill an important gap that exists in the market today for consumers, movie producers and theatrical exhibitors by providing a broader availability of movies to consumers. Theatrical exhibitors are uniquely positioned to not only support, but also benefit from new distribution companies and content providers.
     Regulatory Environment
     The distribution of motion pictures is, in large part, regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. The consent decrees, resulting from one of those cases to which we were not a party, have a material impact on the industry and us. Those consent decrees bind certain major motion picture distributors and require the motion pictures of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis.
     Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations “reasonably accommodate” individuals with disabilities and that new 

 
  20

 
construction or alterations made to “commercial facilities” conform to accessibility guidelines unless “structurally impracticable” for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and awards of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. As an employer covered by the ADA, we must make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of employees and qualified applicants with disabilities, provided that such reasonable accommodations do not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. In addition, many of our employees are covered by various government employment regulations, including minimum wage, overtime and working conditions regulations.
     Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating such matters as construction, renovation and operation of theatres as well as wages and working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and licensing. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
     We also own and operate theatres and other properties including the theatres we acquired in the Odeon acquisition that operate in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Portugal, and Ireland; which may be subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Certain of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on certain statutory classes of persons for the costs of investigation or remediation of contamination, regardless of fault or the legality of original disposal. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
     Significant Acquisitions, Dispositions, Financing and Recent Developments
     The Odeon Acquisition
     On November 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited from Monterey Capital III S.à.r.l. (the “Seller”) and certain shares in Odeon and UCI Cinemas Group Limited (“OUCGL”), a subsidiary of Odeon, from certain Management Shareholders (the “OUCGL shares”), pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2016, by and among AMC, AMC (UK) Acquisition Limited, Seller, Odeon, OUCGL and certain Management Shareholders (the “Share Purchase Agreement”).
     The aggregate purchase price for the Odeon acquisition was £510.4 million ($637.1 million), consisting of (i) cash in the amount of GBP £375.0 million ($468.0 million), (ii) shares of our Class A common stock valued at GBP £125.6 million ($156.7 million), and (iii) payment of approximately £9.8 million ($12.4 million) in employee incentive costs for the OUCGL shares. In addition, we repaid indebtedness of Odeon of approximately $593,173,000 as of November 30, 2016. All U.S. Dollar amounts are based on the Euro/USD exchange rate of 1.06 and a GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.25 on November 29, 2016. The number of shares of our Class A common stock delivered in connection with the Odeon acquisition was 4,536,466 shares, based on the volume weighted average price of the Class A common stock over the twenty consecutive trading days ending three business days before November 30, 2016. In the Share Purchase Agreement, we granted to the Seller certain registration rights, subject to the certain lock-ups and made certain undertakings with respect to the ongoing business and financing activities of AMC to the Seller that expires on the earlier of a date if the Seller ceases to hold more than 49.9% of the shares issued to it at the closing of the Odeon Acquisition, and of up to approximately 18 months (which period may be further extended in certain situations prescribed in the Share Purchase Agreement) from the date of closing of the Odeon acquisition.
     Odeon is a leading European cinema operator with 245 cinemas and 2,249 screens as of December 31, 2016. Odeon operates in four major markets: the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany; and three smaller markets: Austria, Portugal, and Ireland. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Odeon had revenues of £800.2 million ($1,039.2 million). Odeon’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 have been translated into U.S. Dollars at a GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.2987, the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
     We believe Odeon’s European markets offer us considerable opportunity. Similar to the U.S. theatrical exhibition landscape in 2010, Europe’s exhibition industry has experienced very little recent innovation. We believe we are uniquely positioned to leverage our proven theatre renovations, which include comfortable power recliners, enhanced food and beverage offerings and PLF experiences, among others, to drive future growth and value. Odeon also provides us with a strong and scalable platform to pursue future domestic and international growth opportunities.
     For the year ended December 31, 2016, Odeon had a strong 19.5% paid attendance market share with revenues approximating $1,039.2 million and paid attendance of 90 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, average 

 
  21

 
ticket price was £5.89 ($7.65) and food and beverage per patron was £2.20 ($2.86). The GBP amount for the year ended December 31, 2016 has been converted into U.S. Dollar amounts assuming a GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.2987 USD, which was the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
     Odeon transforms us from a domestic focused operator into an international operator with a presence in eight countries. The acquisition further diversifies our footprint by adding theatres with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles that strengthen the combined company’s growth potential. We believe this diversification will result in a more balanced portfolio of theatres that is less dependent on certain genres of films and more exposed to the strong growth trends in the global box office.
     The Carmike Acquisition
     On December 21, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, Inc. for cash and stock. The purchase price for Carmike was $858,240,000 comprised of cash of $584,291,000 and 8,189,808 shares of our Class A common stock with a fair value of $273,949,000 (based on a closing share price of $33.45 per share on December 20, 2016). We also assumed debt of $230,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Notes due June 15, 2023 (the “Senior Secured Notes due 2023”) in connection with the acquisition of Carmike. As of the acquisition date, Carmike operated 271 theatres and 2,923 screens located in 41 states. 
     Carmike is a U.S. leader in digital cinema, 3-D cinema deployments and alternative programming and is one of the nation’s largest motion picture exhibitors. As of December 21, 2016, Carmike had 271 theatres with 2,923 screens in 41 states. The circuit includes 55 premium large format (“PLF”) auditoriums featuring state-of-the-art technology and luxurious seating, including 32 “BigDs,” 21 IMAX® auditoriums and two MuviXL screens. As “America’s Hometown Theatre Chain” Carmike’s primary focus is mid‑sized communities.
     To receive regulatory approval to acquire Carmike, we entered into a settlement with the United States Department of Justice, pursuant to which we agreed to divest 17 theatres in 15 local markets where we have an overlap with Carmike. In addition, we agreed to divest most of our holdings and relinquish all of our governance rights in NCM, our joint venture for cinema screen advertising. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to divest our equity interests in NCM over a period of 30 months to no more than 4.99% by December 20, 2019, with a reduction of our equity interests to no more than 15% by December 20, 2017 and to no more than 7.5% by December 20, 2018. In addition, we agreed to transfer 24 theatres with a total of 384 screens to the network of Screenvision LLC, the cinema screen advertising business in which Carmike participates. This includes five Carmike theatres that implemented the Screenvision network prior to completion of the Carmike acquisition, an AMC theatre required to extended its existing term with the Screenvision network, and an AMC theatre that was also included in the divestitures. 
     Our acquisition of Carmike increased and diversified our domestic footprint and made us the #1 theatre operator in the United States. By eliminating duplicative general and administrative services and leveraging scale, we believe the Carmike acquisition affords us approximately $35 million of cost synergies. Carmike also offers us a unique opportunity to introduce our guest-focused strategic initiatives to millions of new movie-goers. Carmike’s predominately non-urban southeast U.S. markets complement our urban northeast, midwest and west coast U.S. markets very well and should allow us to minimize the volatility in our box office results due to film genre attendance fluctuations. We intend to deploy a multi-brand strategy in the United States: AMC Theatres - focused on theatres located in large urban areas, AMC Classic Theatres – focused on mid-size and non-urban markets and AMC Dine-In Theatres focused on movies and full service dining. We believe this multi-branding strategy will help set customer expectations and will allow us to preserve Carmike’s existing low cost structure model.

     The Proposed Nordic Acquisition
     On January 20, 2017, we and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with European Cinemas S.à.r.l., Bonnier Holding AB and certain Management Sellers as defined in the Purchase Agreement (collectively “Sellers”), relating to the purchase of Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”).

 
  22

 

     Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we will acquire the shares of Nordic from the Sellers (the “Share Purchase”) for a purchase price of approximately SEK 5,601 million (approximately $631 million), subject to certain adjustments at closing as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including payment of interest on the purchase price from November 1, 2016 through closing. We will also refinance Nordic’s indebtedness at the closing of the Share Purchase, which is estimated to be approximately SEK 2,833 million (approximately $319 million) assuming closing occurs in April 2017 (the “Nordic Debt Refinancing” and together with the Share Purchase, the “Nordic Acquisition”). We have fully committed debt financing in place (as described below) to fund the proposed Nordic Acquisition. The above SEK amounts have been converted into U.S. Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.1126 USD and an SEK/EUR exchange rate of 0.1052, which were the exchange rates on January 20, 2017. The completion of the Purchase Agreement is subject to, among other conditions, antitrust clearance by the European Commission.
     The Purchase Agreement is not subject to a financing condition. The Purchase Agreement may be terminated if European Commission approval is not obtained by April 30, 2017, subject to the parties ability to extend such date twice by 30 business days each time if, in the reasonable expectation of the party implementing such extension, European Commission approval will be capable of being obtained in that time frame.
     Nordic is the largest theatre exhibitor in the group of seven countries in which it operates in the affluent northern region of Europe. Nordic operates 68 theatres and has a substantial minority interest (approximately a 50% ownership) in another 50 associated theatres to which Nordic provides a variety of shared services. Nordic’s theatres are number one in market share in Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Nordic currently is number two in market share in Norway, and with a new theatre currently under construction in Norway and scheduled to open next year, is expected to increase market share in Norway to number one as well. Nordic also has theatres in Denmark. The proposed Nordic acquisition would enhance our position as the #1 movie exhibition company in Europe going forward, and would broaden and diversify our European platform. In addition, we expect to realize approximately $5 million of annual cost synergies as a result of the proposed Nordic Acquisition.
     Nordic has 68 theatres, 463 screens, and approximately 68,000 seats in nearly 50 large and medium-sized cities in the Nordic and Baltic nations and a substantial minority investment in another 50 associated theatres with 204 screens, to which Nordic provides a variety of shared services. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, Nordic had annual attendance of approximately 24.4 million, average ticket price of SEK 85.8 ($10.19) and average concession per head of SEK 23.9 ($2.84).The SEK amount for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 has been converted into U.S. Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.1188 USD, which was the average exchange rate for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. All Nordic activities are conducted locally in seven markets under several brands, including SF Bio in Sweden, SF Kino in Norway, Finnkino in Finland, and Forum Cinemas in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Additional associated theatres also operate in Denmark.
     Nordic had approximately SEK 2,938 million ($349 million) of revenue in 2015, including box office revenues of SEK 1,928 million ($229 million). The SEK amounts for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been converted into U.S. Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.1186 USD, which was the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total revenues for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2016 were SEK 3,159 million ($375 million) and Nordic operating margins for that twelve month period exceeded our operating margins. The SEK amount for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 has been converted into U.S. Dollar amounts assuming an SEK/USD exchange rate of 0.1188 USD, which was the average exchange rate for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. The foregoing financial data with respect to Nordic is unaudited and has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and is not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The accounting rules under IFRS and U.S. GAAP are different which may lead to differences in accounting upon completion of the Nordic Acquisition.
     In connection with the proposed Nordic Acquisition, we entered into an amended and restated debt financing commitment letter (the “Nordic Debt Commitment Letter”) with certain affiliates of the underwriters (each, a “Nordic Commitment Party” and collectively, the “Nordic Commitment Parties”) on January 30, 2017, pursuant to which the Nordic Commitment Parties have committed to arrange and provide us with (i) a senior secured incremental term loan in an aggregate amount of up to $675.0 million and (ii) a senior subordinated bridge loan in an aggregate amount of up to 

 
  23

 
$325.0 million, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Nordic Debt Commitment Letter. These debt commitments may be reduced in certain circumstances with certain debt and/or equity financings.
     As of February 21, 2017, the senior secured incremental term loan debt commitment has been reduced to $482.0 million and the senior subordinated bridge loan commitment has been reduced to $250.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Nordic Debt Commitment Letter and as a result of the completion of our equity offerings in February 2017.
     Other Acquisitions
     In December 2015, we completed the acquisition of 33 theatres and 346 screens, from Starplex Cinemas. In December 2012, we completed the acquisition of 4 theatres and 61 screens from Rave Review Cinemas, LLC and 6 theatres and 95 screens from Rave Digital Media, LLC. In May 2010, we completed the acquisition of 92 theatres and 928 screens from Kerasotes.
     In January 2016, we divested of two Starplex Cinemas theatres with 22 screens, as required by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, management decided to permanently close 73 underperforming screens and auditoriums. In May 2010, in connection with the acquisition of Kerasotes, we divested of 11 theatres as required by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice.
     Debt Financing of Completed Acquisitions
     On November 8, 2016, in connection with the Completed Acquisitions, we issued $595.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2026 and £250.0 million ($310 million) of our 6.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 each pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 8, 2016, among us, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. On November 29, 2016, in connection with the Odeon Acquisition, we borrowed $500.0 million of incremental term loans (the “New Term Loans”) under our Credit Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2013 (as amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of December 11, 2015, and that certain Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2016, the “Senior Secured Credit Agreement”). On December 21, 2016, in connection with the Carmike Acquisition, we incurred $350.0 million of bridge loans (the “Bridge Loans”) under a Bridge Loan Agreement, dated as of December 21, 2016 (the “Bridge Loan Agreement”), among us, the lenders party thereto, Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Barclays Bank PLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. We repaid the Bridge Loans on February 13, 2017, with a portion of the net proceeds from our additional public offering. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7 of Part II hereof for further information.
     IMAX® Screens
     On January 19, 2017, we and IMAX® Corporation announced that the number of IMAX® screens at our legacy AMC locations is expected to increase by 15% year over year by the end of the first quarter 2017, with a total of 175 legacy AMC locations open by March 2017. Our current commitment to IMAX® is 185 theatres through 2019.
     Dolby Cinema™ at AMC Screens
     On January 10, 2017, we and Dolby Laboratories, Inc. (“Dolby”) announced the opening of the 50th Dolby™ Cinema at our theatre in Roseville, Minnesota. The completion of this theatre puts the Dolby Cinema™ at AMC partnership plan on schedule. We and Dolby plan to complete the installation of 160 Dolby Cinema™ at our sites by the end of 2018. 
     Seasonality
     Our revenues are dependent upon the timing of motion picture releases by distributors. The most marketable motion pictures are usually released during the summer and the year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is highly seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons. Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
