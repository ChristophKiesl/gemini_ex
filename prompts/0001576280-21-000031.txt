Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading precision oncology company focused on helping conquer cancer globally through use of our proprietary blood-based tests, vast data sets and advanced analytics. We believe that the key to conquering cancer is unprecedented access to its molecular information throughout all stages of the disease, which we intend to enable by a routine blood draw, or liquid biopsy. Our Guardant Health Oncology Platform is designed to leverage our capabilities in technology, clinical development, regulatory and reimbursement to drive commercial adoption, accelerate drug development, improve patient clinical outcomes and lower healthcare costs. In pursuit of our goal to manage cancer across all stages of the disease, we have launched our Guardant360, Guardant360 CDx and GuardantOMNI liquid biopsy-based tests for advanced stage cancer and in February 2021, launched our Guardant Reveal liquid biopsy-based test for residual and recurring cancer to first address the need in Stage II-III colorectal cancer. We are developing tests from our Guardant360 tissue program which aims to address challenges with tissue genotyping products currently available in the market and are also developing tests from our LUNAR program which aims to address the needs of early-stage cancer patients with neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment selection, cancer survivors with surveillance, and asymptomatic individuals eligible for cancer screening and individuals at a higher risk for developing cancer with early detection. We have also developed our GuardantINFORM platform to further accelerate precision oncology drug development by biopharmaceutical companies by offering them an in-silico research platform to unlock further insights into tumor evolution and treatment resistance across various biomarker-driven cancers. 
Therapy selection in advanced stage cancer patients - We are pioneering the clinical comprehensive liquid biopsy market with our tests. Our Guardant360 test is a molecular diagnostic test measuring 74 cancer-related genes, our Guardant360 CDx was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, measuring 55 cancer related genes, and our GuardantOMNI test has a broader 500-gene panel, all of which analyze circulating tumor DNA in blood. Based on SEER Cancer Registry statistics we estimate the total number of metastatic cancer patients in the United States to be approximately 700,000. Our Guardant360 test has been used over 150,000 times by clinicians to help inform which therapy may be effective for advanced stage cancer patients with solid tumors. Our tests are used by biopharmaceutical companies for a range of applications, including identifying target patient populations to accelerate translational science research and clinical trial enrollment, companion diagnostic development, and post-approval commercialization. The increasing diversity of targeted therapies and associated molecular biomarkers has given rise to comprehensive genomic profiling, particularly in tumor types where multiple genomic targets can be found and treated effectively. For example, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, like other tumors, has multiple effective treatment options targeting different genomic mutations. There are nine targetable genes in NSCLC, which are comprised of alterations across all four genomic variant classes (SNVs, indels, CNVs, and fusions), as well as TMB. Five of these targets are on-label approved biomarkers for FDA-approved therapies. The NCCN treatment guidelines recommended testing for all of the genomic mutations or alterations across different cancer types, which demonstrates the requirement for broader genomic profiling. 
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment selection in early-stage cancer patients and surveillance in cancer survivors -We are developing tests from our LUNAR program for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment selection in early-stage cancer patients. For early stage solid tumors, neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment may be given as a first step in care to shrink the tumor or adjuvantly as a secondary treatment after the primary treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, not all early stage cancer patients may benefit from neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment. For instance, based on data published in 2007 from a randomized study of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation in patients with colorectal cancer, the use of adjuvant treatment showed significant benefit for a subgroup of the patients who meet certain clinical criteria, but only marginal benefit for the patients who do not meet these criteria. We have developed the Guardant Reveal test for minimal residual disease which can help identify recurrence earlier than traditional modalities in cancer survivors and potentially identify early stage cancer patients who may benefit from adjuvant treatment. Our Guardant Reveal test leverages data and learnings from our tests and is designed to enable clinicians to detect minimal residual disease and to detect cancer recurrence at a stage when intervention may have a higher chance of success. We believe our Guardant Reveal test may also help biopharmaceutical companies identify new drug development opportunities. In return, these relationships could help us establish clinical utility for our tests and create new testing opportunities related to emerging therapies.
Early detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals eligible for cancer screening - We are developing the LUNAR-2 test to support cancer screening in asymptomatic individuals including who are eligible for colorectal cancer screening based on the 2016 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, guidelines for colorectal cancer screening. Recent data reported at the 2019 National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, shows that amongst this population, approximately 31% are not up to date with the recommended colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, we believe there is a significant unmet need for non-invasive modalities such as our LUNAR-2 assay that, if successfully developed, we believe could increase compliance with the USPSTF guidelines. We are also pursuing further development of our LUNAR-2 test to support screening for additional cancer types in asymptomatic individuals recommended by the USPSTF and cancer types without a reference standard for screening. We believe that developing a blood test for early detection of cancer requires a vast amount of molecular and clinical data across all stages of the disease in order to better understand the biology and clinical relevance of tumor-specific biomarkers in blood. While we believe the benefits of early detection on clinical outcomes are widely known, early detection may also benefit biopharmaceutical companies by identifying a much larger at-risk population who may benefit from early therapeutic intervention or from preventative medicines.
Guardant Health Oncology Platform - We believe our Guardant Health Oncology Platform has developed strengths across five critical layers, each of which facilitates success in the adjacent layers, and together the five layers form a barrier to entry and provide us a competitive advantage and a platform we can efficiently leverage across multiple products. The five layers of our Guardant Health Oncology Platform are as follows:
Technology - Our proprietary Guardant Health digital sequencing technology combines cutting edge capabilities from multiple disciplines including biochemistry, next-generation sequencing, signal processing, bioinformatics, machine learning and process engineering to enable what we believe to be the world’s market leading comprehensive liquid biopsy test with a typical turnaround time of less than seven days after we receive the sample 
and enable our high performing liquid biopsy tests intended for different market segments. Furthermore, our machine learning capability enables performance improvement as we incorporate additional data.
Clinical utility - We believe that success in the clinical utility layer requires both independent investments in clinical research and strategic relationships with market-leading biopharmaceutical companies. We have invested heavily in clinical studies, including more than 60 clinical outcomes studies demonstrating that overall biomarker detection rates of our non-invasive blood testing were in line with standard of care tissue testing. Our clinical research collaborations have resulted in more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. We also have relationships with over 60 biopharmaceutical customers that have provided rigorous clinical validation of our technology and early insights into test opportunities for emerging therapeutics.
Regulatory approval - We believe our Guardant360 test was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy approved by the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH. In addition, based on our review of publicly available records, we believe our facility was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy laboratory to be certified pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and NYSDOH-permitted. Our Guardant360 CDx test was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy test approved
 by the FDA, to provide tumor mutation profiling for cancer patients with solid tumors and to be used as a companion diagnostic initially in connection with one therapeutic product of a biopharmaceutical customer. 
Payer coverage and reimbursement - The analytical and clinical data that we have generated in our efforts to establish clinical utility, combined with the support we have developed with key opinion leaders, or KOLs, in the oncology space have led to positive coverage decisions by a number of commercial payers. Our Guardant360 test is currently covered by Cigna, Priority Health, multiple regional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans as well as the health plans associated with eviCore for NSCLC, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage with these payers with respect to NSCLC patients. 
With respect to Medicare, in July 2018, Palmetto GBA, or Palmetto, the Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, responsible for administering Medicare’s Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, or MolDx, issued a local coverage determination, or LCD, for our Guardant360 test with respect to NSCLC patients who meet certain clinical criteria, and in May 2020, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, or Noridian, the MAC responsible for adjudicating claims in California, where our laboratory is located, and a participant in MolDx, issued a coverage article and confirmed limited Medicare coverage for our Guardant360 test for qualifying patients diagnosed with solid tumor cancers of non-central nervous system origin who meet the criteria of Medicare’s National Coverage Determination for Next Generation Sequencing (90.2) first established in March 2018, or the NGS NCD. Following FDA approval of our Guardant360 CDx test, we believe our Guardant360 CDx test qualifies for Medicare coverage for FDA-approved indications for use. Future actions taken by Medicare, Noridian or Palmetto may change Medicare coverage for our Guardant360 tests. 
Commercial adoption - Success in each of the layers above is important for commercial adoption of our tests by clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies. Additionally, for clinicians, endorsement by KOLs, utilization by academic centers and inclusion in national treatment guidelines are important, especially for adoption in the local community setting where 80% of cancer treatment occurs. Our relationships with key stakeholders across the oncology space, clinical data we believe to support use of Guardant360 test ahead of tissue based testing, as well as the inclusion of liquid biopsy as a potential alternative under certain circumstances to tissue biopsy in NCCN guidelines, have helped facilitate the use of our tests by 9,000 oncologists, who have collectively ordered our Guardant360 test over 150,000 times, and over 60 biopharmaceutical companies. We sold 63,254 tests to clinical customers in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase from 49,926 and 29,238 in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We sold 15,983 tests to biopharmaceutical customers in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 20,643 and 10,370 in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Our products and development program 
We have launched our Guardant360, Guardant360 CDx, GuardantOMNI and Guardant Reveal tests and are developing additional tests under our Guardant360 tissue and LUNAR program. We believe our product portfolio, once completed, will address the full continuum of care and has utility in both the clinical and biopharmaceutical markets.
Guardant360 CDx test
We believe our Guardant360 CDx test is the market leading comprehensive liquid biopsy test, based on the number of tests ordered. Guardant360 CDx test is a 55 gene FDA approved test that supports treatment selection for advanced stage cancer patients with solid tumors. Additional gene content and immune-oncology biomarkers (e.g. MSI) are reported in a professional services compendium to the FDA approved CDx report. Results are typically delivered within seven days following receipt of sample and delivered by a clinical report. 
Guardant360 test
The number of personalized therapy options for advanced cancer patients continues to grow, giving patients who may have cycled through standard of care therapies additional options. Focused on addressing patient care 
throughout the diagnostic journey, we launched an updated and expanded version of our laboratory developed test or LDT in 2020 to support new guideline-recommended biomarkers, including our industry leading plasma-based tumor mutational burden or TMB, MSI-High, expanded homologous recombination repair or HRR gene set, and full coverage of neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase or NTRK fusions. The Guardant360 LDT ensures progressing patients are given the opportunity to be eligible for these new treatment options, without the need to obtain archival tissue or subject the patient to another invasive biopsy. Results are typically delivered, ten days following receipt of sample and delivered by a clinical report. 
Guardant360 clinical report
A typical Guardant360 CDx and Guardant360 clinical report contains somatic mutations, immuno-oncology markers detected in patient blood samples, associated treatment options and available clinical trials in the vicinity of the patient’s location. Additionally, the report depicts a proprietary visual representation that shows the evolution of somatic mutations in longitudinal blood samples. 
Clinical trials and publications
The goal of our clinical development with Guardant360 tests is to support its use for comprehensive genomic profiling across multiple tumor types, including as a preferred alternative to tissue testing to inform first line treatment right after diagnosis and at time of disease progression. We publish peer-reviewed studies in order to influence treatment guidelines, to educate clinicians and other oncology stakeholders about the value proposition of our test and to set the stage for reimbursement with private and public payers. We have over 60 approved, completed or active clinical outcomes studies, more than 200 peer-reviewed publications and more than 400 scientific abstracts. We are proactively pursuing studies to support the use of our Guardant360 tests as a preferred alternative to tissue testing to inform first line treatment right after diagnosis, with the goal to provide evidence that our Guardant360 tests detects genomic alterations at a similar rate compared to standard of care tissue testing in the United States, Europe and Asia. Such a strategy is predicated on the Guardant360 tests' ability to offer accurate, reliable and fast guideline-directed comprehensive genotyping for all adult solid tumors without exposing patients to invasive biopsy procedures’ risks, delays or chance of failure. 
GuardantConnect
Because metastatic cancer patients often exhaust standard of care treatment options as the disease progresses and guidelines recommend clinical trials for advanced cancer patients, clinical trial matching is an acute need in oncology. At the same time, biopharmaceutical companies need to fill clinical trials that require screening hundreds of thousands of patients. Despite these needs, clinical trial enrollment in oncology has severely lagged, with only 3-6% of cancer patients enrolling in clinical trials. GuardantConnect is our integrated software-based solution designed for our clinical and biopharmaceutical customers, seeking to connect patients tested with the Guardant360 assay with actionable alterations with potentially relevant clinical trials. 
GuardantINFORM
In 2020 we launched GuardantINFORM, our real-world evidence platform featuring an extensive clinical-genomic liquid biopsy dataset of advanced cancer patients. The GuardantINFORM platform is intended to help accelerate research and development of the next generation of cancer therapeutics by offering biopharma partners an in silico resource that combines de-identified longitudinal clinical information and genomic data collected from the Guardant360 liquid biopsy test. This robust dataset offers real-world insights into anti-cancer therapy use and associated outcomes, and molecular drivers of treatment response and resistance for over 60 advanced cancers including non-small cell lung, breast, colon, and prostate. Applications for the GuardantINFORM platform include targeted drug development, clinical trial optimization and post-marketing studies. 
GuardantOMNI Test
Our GuardantOMNI test is built on Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology and learnings from our Guardant360 test. The GuardantOMNI test, launched in 2017, has a significantly larger genomic panel footprint than the Guardant360 test and has achieved comparable analytical performance in clinical studies, including for translational science applications in collaboration with several biopharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck MSD, Merck KGaA of Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer. It covers 500 
genes, including genes associated with homologous recombination repair deficiency and biomarkers for immuno-oncology applications, such as tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability.
In order to preserve performance characteristics of our Guardant360 test across a broader gene panel, we implemented additional enhancements to the assay efficiency and bioinformatics analysis to improve the sensitivity of our GuardantOMNI test. These enhancements are critical in the context of using the GuardantOMNI test in the retrospective testing of clinical trial samples for translational science applications in collaboration with biopharmaceutical customers, as those samples are often available with only a limited volume of plasma.
Validation data indicates that the GuardantOMNI test exceeds the Guardant360 test’s sensitivity for detecting clinically actionable biomarkers. At the same time, broader panel-wide performance of small variants is roughly similar to that of Guardant360 test. The broad genomic footprint of our GuardantOMNI test enables accurate measurement of tumor mutational burden. The GuardantOMNI test received breakthrough device designation from the FDA in December 2018 and is currently being developed, including for use as a potential companion diagnostic, to identify patients who may benefit from immuno-oncology therapeutics, including patients that may more likely respond to immuno-oncology agents based on TMB.
Guardant Reveal Test
In the management of early-stage cancer, current tools do not identify all high risk patients who will benefit from adjuvant therapy or detect recurrence early enough when it is most curable. We plan to address this need, first in Stage II-III colorectal cancer, with our Guardant Reveal test launched in February 2021 for residual disease and recurrence monitoring. Guardant Reveal test will enable oncologists to improve the care of early-stage cancer patients by correctly identifying more high-risk patients than clinicopathologic review alone and by detecting recurrent disease months earlier than current standard of care methods like imaging carcinoembryonic antigen tests. We expect the Guardant Reveal test to achieve best in class performance and fast turnaround by simultaneously interrogating both genomic and epigenomic signals from a single blood draw without the need for tissue. Similar to our data development effort for our Guardant360 tests, we are investing very heavily in establishing clinical utility for the use of Guardant Reveal in adjuvant treatment settings. In 2020, we launched three clinical trials in collaboration with key cancer researchers: COBRA, a randomized controlled study, comprising over 1,400 low-risk stage-II colon cancer patients, ACT-3, comprising over 500 stage 3 colorectal cancer patients, and PEGASUS for the de-escalation of therapy, encompassing over 140 high-risk stage-II and stage-III colon cancer patients. 
Guardant360 Next-Generation Tissue Program
To complement our liquid biopsy-based products, we are developing a Guardant360 tissue product. Tissue genotyping is currently widely available to physicians and patients. We believe many tissue genotyping products currently available to physicians and patients have experienced long delays in getting results to physicians and high failure rates because of the inability to obtain enough tissue or high-quality DNA for analysis. Such delay or inability to produce results from tissue genotyping can adversely affect providing the right treatment to patients at the right time. We therefore intend our Guardant360 next-generation tissue assay, together with our liquid biopsy-based products, to help address the challenges with tissue genotyping products currently in the market. 
LUNAR-2 Program
We believe that there is a critical need to develop products to expand precision oncology to earlier stage cancer settings. Such products would enable clinicians to precisely detect, monitor and select the appropriate intervention at the right times in the disease’s evolution, key to significantly improving patient clinical outcomes. In order to systematically address this need, we are developing a test for asymptomatic individuals eligible for cancer screening in line with the USPSTF guidelines and in cancers where a well-established screening paradigm does not yet exist. Our research and development results to date indicate that somatic signatures alone may be insufficient for detection of early stage cancers with high sensitivity. For this reason, we have incorporated epigenomic signatures to enhance the performance of our LUNAR-2 assay in these settings.
Early cancer detection is challenging, especially with respect to clinical specificity. There is a minimal amount of ctDNA in patients with low-disease burden. Additionally, naturally occurring genomic aberrations in blood as well as signals from non-cancer related diseases can add biological noise obfuscating detection of circulating tumor-related biomarkers. We believe we have the unique capability to overcome these challenges by leveraging our:
•Vast data sets and deep insights: We have targeted deep sequencing data in combination with low coverage sequencing of whole genome from tens of thousands of cancer patients. This data has enabled discovery of novel epigenomic variations across multiple cancer types. We believe augmenting genomic with epigenomic signatures can enhance the clinical sensitivity and specificity of our tests significantly. Moreover, we developed a database of biological noise sources such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, which enables us to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of our tests.
•Extensive blood biobank: We have a biobank of tens of thousands of cancer samples that we use for discovery and, more importantly, biomarker verification and validation. For example, we are analyzing these samples with whole genome sequencing to identify and confirm tumor associated signatures. Also, we have been collecting additional samples through multiple on-going research collaborations.
Guardant-19 Test
In 2020, we launched our Guardant-19 test and received the FDA’s emergency use authorization for use in the detection of the novel coronavirus. Consistent with our belief that earlier cancer detection leads to better outcomes, we believe active surveillance of the novel coronavirus will benefit the health and safety of many essential businesses and communities. Given the significant testing needs for the foreseeable future, we leveraged our expertise to contribute to this need. The Guardant-19 test is being offered to our employees and select partner organizations in our CLIA-certified clinical laboratory. 
Commercialization 
U.S. clinical commercial efforts
We sell our tests to clinical customers in the United States through our targeted sales organization. Our clinician-focused sales organization in the United States is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily targeting oncologists and cancer centers. Our sales representatives typically have extensive backgrounds in laboratory testing, therapeutics and oncology. We have supplemented the team with clinical oncology specialists with extensive medical affairs experience for molecular information support in the field.   
Our clinical commercial efforts are focused on driving adoption with academic research institutions and with community oncology practices, including through leading physician networks. As we continue to grow our sales organization, we are also expanding our reach to include large community practices, community oncology networks, integrated delivery/ payer-owned systems and government medical facilities that are looking for a reliable partner for comprehensive molecular information testing. 
International clinical commercial efforts
We currently offer our tests in countries outside the United States primarily through direct contacts with insurers and hospitals and through distributor relationships. 
Currently, all customer samples are shipped globally to our laboratory in Redwood City, California. We are conducting studies in various jurisdictions and have started efforts to secure reimbursement in several countries. As these studies progress and we near commercial opportunities there, we may seek to establish in-country laboratories and direct sales organizations. Specifically, we have already demonstrated the ability to deploy our technology to partner laboratories such as cancer centers, for the development of liquid biopsy assays based on our technology platform. We believe that this capability will be important in accelerating adoption of our platform and the performance of liquid biopsy testing in certain countries.
Together with SoftBank, we formed a joint venture, Guardant Health AMEA, Inc., which we refer to as the Joint Venture. We expect to rely on the Joint Venture to accelerate commercialization of our products in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Currently, we and the Joint Venture are primarily focused on expanding our commercial capabilities in Asia. There are estimated to be over 400,000 deaths from solid tumor cancers annually in Japan with a significant portion relating to lung and gastric cancers. We are involved in several nationwide clinical programs that help establish clinical utility of our Guardant360 test in the Japanese population with the first patient tested in 
late 2018. In 2021, an affiliate of the Joint Venture submitted an application to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for regulatory approval of Guardant360 CDx in Japan. 
In preparation for wider commercialization in the European Union, we obtained a CE mark for our Guardant360 CDx test performed in Redwood City and also achieved ISO15189 accreditation. In 2020, we signed the first public private partnership agreement with Vall D'Hebron Institute of Oncology, one of Europe’s leading cancer research institutions. We expect this partnership will lead to the establishment of liquid biopsy testing services at the partner laboratory, using Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology, as well as generation of clinical and economic evidence to support commissioning in other areas of Europe. 
Biopharmaceutical commercial efforts
Our business development team is focused on enterprise selling to biopharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. Our strategy with each biopharmaceutical customer is to demonstrate the value proposition of the Guardant Health Oncology Platform and expand its utilization across the organization from early stage research through clinical development to commercialization. Given the broad and differentiated utility of our platform, we believe we can support our biopharmaceutical customers across many applications, including: 
•discovery of new targets and mechanisms of acquired resistance;
•retrospective sample analysis to rapidly identify biomarkers associated with response and lack of response; 
•prospective screening and referral services to accelerate clinical trial enrollment; and
•companion diagnostic development to support the approval and commercialization of therapeutics. 
We also expect to be able to capture other commercial opportunities from our genomic data, which can be used in combination with clinical outcomes or claims data for multiple applications, including novel target identification.
Payer coverage and reimbursement 
We estimate total lung cancer payer coverage in the United States for our Guardant360 test to be a total of more than 200 million lives, including Medicare beneficiaries and members of several commercial health plans.
Commercial payers 
Payment from commercial payers can vary depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payers as a “participating provider” or do not have a contract and are considered a “non-participating provider.” Payers often reimburse non-participating providers at a lower amount than participating providers or not at all. When we contract with a payer to serve as a participating provider, reimbursements by the payer are generally made pursuant to a negotiated fee schedule and are limited to only covered indications or where prior approval has been obtained. Becoming a participating provider can result in higher reimbursement amounts for covered uses of our test and, potentially, no reimbursement for non-covered uses identified under the payer’s policies or the contract. As a result, the potential for more favorable reimbursement associated with becoming a participating provider may be offset by a potential loss of reimbursement for non-covered uses of our tests.
We have provided testing services to patients covered by commercial payers with many cancer types and indications, most of the time as a non-participating provider through 2020. We received reimbursement for tests across the spectrum of these patients, though for amounts that on average were significantly lower than for participating providers. Because we are not contracted with these payers, they determine the amount that they are willing to reimburse us for any of our tests and they can prospectively and retrospectively adjust the amount of reimbursement.
We have experienced situations where commercial payers proactively reduced the amounts they were willing to reimburse for our tests, and where commercial payers have determined that the amounts previously paid were too high and sought to recover those perceived excess payments by deducting such amounts from payments owed to us.
Coverage from commercial payers has been focused on NSCLC, which represented approximately 43%, 44% and 46% of our U.S. clinical testing volume in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cigna, Priority Health, multiple Blue Cross Blue Shield plans as well as the health plans associated with eviCore adopted policies that cover our Guardant360 test for the majority of NSCLC patients we test. If their policies were to change in the future to cover 
additional cancer indications, we anticipate that our total reimbursement would increase. To date, the benefit of increased reimbursement for covered NSCLC Guardant360 testing as a participating provider has been approximately offset by the loss of reimbursement on tests for non-covered indications previously received when we served as a non-participating provider. Therefore, the net result of receiving coverage for a particular indication, including NSCLC, may be little to no change in our average revenue per test for all our patients served by these insurance payers.
In addition to our existing contracted payers, various laboratory benefit managers and evidence review organizations working with commercial payers have endorsed coverage of our Guardant360 test.
We are actively engaged to expand coverage among existing contracted payers and to achieve coverage with the remaining key commercial payers, laboratory benefit managers and evidence review organizations. This includes addressing variable coverage requirements and evidence required, and the need for enhanced guideline support. 
As we broaden our coverage amongst contracted payers to include additional tests of ours, we may begin to experience increases in average revenue per test performed; however, we cannot make any assurances that we will be successful in broadening our coverage on a timely basis or at all. Similarly, as we have experienced with our existing contracted payers, we cannot assure that the addition of new contracted payers will increase our average selling price or revenue. 

Government payers
Medicare coverage is limited to items and services that are within the scope of a Medicare benefit category that are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. National coverage determinations are made through an evidence-based process by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, with opportunities for public participation. Medicare’s NGS NCD provides coverage for molecular diagnostic tests such as our Guardant360 CDx test, if, among other criteria, such tests are offered within their FDA-approved companion diagnostic labeling.
In September 2018, we began to receive reimbursement from Medicare for claims submitted with respect to Guardant360 clinical tests performed for NSCLC patients. In March 2020, we began to receive reimbursement from Medicare for claims submitted with respect to Guardant360 clinical tests performed for qualifying patients diagnosed with solid tumor cancers of non-central nervous system origin other than NSCLC. Under Medicare, payment for laboratory tests like ours is generally made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, with payment amounts assigned to specific procedure billing codes. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements under PAMA. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS were required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostic laboratory tests”), commercial payer payment rates and volumes for each test they perform. CMS uses this data to calculate a weighted median payment rate for each test, which is used to establish revised Medicare CLFS reimbursement rates for the test. As we have begun billing Medicare for our tests, we are subject to reporting requirements under PAMA and the Medicare rate for our tests will be calculated in the future based on our private payer rates. For tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are based upon these reported commercial payer rates. 
Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, coding plays a significant role in how our Guardant360 test is reimbursed both from commercial and governmental payers. In addition, Z-Code Identifiers are used by certain payers, including under Medicare’s MolDx, to supplement CPT codes for molecular diagnostics tests such as our Guardant360 test. Changes to the codes used to report the Guardant360 test to payers may result in significant changes in its reimbursement. If a coding change were to occur, including as a result of the FDA approval of our Guardant360 test, payments for certain uses of the Guardant360 test could be reduced, put on hold, or eliminated by such payers. Following the FDA approval of our Guardant360 CDx test, a new Z-Code Identifier is expected to be issued, and a new pricing is expected to be established under MolDx for the Guardant360 CDx test. While we expect to continue to submit claims to Medicare for Guardant360 LDT clinical tests performed for such qualifying patients using the existing Z-Code Identifier, Medicare has instructed us to not submit claims to Medicare for Guardant360 CDx clinical tests until the new code is issued for the Guardant360 CDx test and the corresponding pricing is established. A proprietary laboratory analyses, or PLA, code was issued for our Guardant360 CDx test in January 2021 with an effective date in April 2021. Once the PLA code is effective, all Guardant360 CDx services will be billed with this new code. Additionally, based on this new PLA code, we applied to CMS for our Guardant360 CDx 
test to become an advanced diagnostic laboratory test, or ADLT. If CMS grants ADLT status to the Guardant360 CDx test, for the first three quarters thereafter, we can only bill Medicare for the test at the lowest available commercial rate at the launch of the test. After the initial three quarters, we can bill Medicare for Guardant360 CDx services at the median rate of claims paid by commercial payers. Changes to the codes used to bill a test to payers may result in significant changes in its reimbursement, which could negatively impact our revenue. As a result of implementing this new coding change for our Guardant360 CDx test, payments for Guardant360 CDx services could be reduced, put on hold, or eliminated by such payers.
State Medicaid programs make individual coverage decisions for diagnostic tests and have taken steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. We believe that additional state and federal health care reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the clinical laboratory industry and our ability to successfully commercialize our tests. Any of these or other changes could substantially impact our revenues and increase costs. We cannot predict how future healthcare policy changes, if any, will affect our business and financial success. 
Other Considerations
Where we are not reimbursed in full or at all, we may elect to appeal the insurer’s underpayment or denial of payment or seek payment from the patient. However, insurer appeal and patient collection efforts take a substantial amount of time and resources and are often unsuccessful. We cannot guarantee future success of, or any payments from, appeals of reimbursement denials by payers. Historic success and payments are not indicative of future success of and payments from such appeals.
Due to the inherent variability and unpredictability of the reimbursement landscape, including related to the amount that payers reimburse us for any of our tests, previously recorded revenue adjustments are not indicative of future revenue adjustments from actual cash collections, which may fluctuate significantly. This variability and unpredictability could increase the risk of future revenue reversal and result in our failing to meet any previously publicly stated guidance we may provide.
Operations
We perform our tests in our clinical laboratory located in Redwood City, California. Our laboratory is an FDA approved (Guardant360 CDx), CAP-accredited, CLIA-certified, NYSDOH-permitted and also licensed in California, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
The proprietary validated methods utilize robust semi-automated workflows designed for high throughput sample testing. This methodology allows for rapid scaling of testing volume without impacting performance metrics. Our testing process includes blood collection, laboratory processing, analysis and reporting. All major processing steps utilize quality control to ensure consistent and reproducible results.
Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology
Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology combines state-of-the-art technology from multiple disciplines and is enabled by robust, high-efficiency biochemistry at the front-end, next-generation sequencing and a machine learning augmented bioinformatics pipeline. The technology, through machine learning, has accrued performance improvements by incorporating learnings generated from the data collected from additional samples.
Supply chain
We utilize industry leading vendors for our supply chain. Most reagents and materials are sourced from a limited number of vendors and would require qualification to transition to a different vendor. To mitigate risk, we employ a multi-month, multi-lot safety stock strategy to ensure an uninterrupted supply of reagent and material to our laboratory. In the event that a latent defect is identified, the lot of material in use is expected to be timely quarantined and changed for a new vendor lot that has been previously qualified for use. The experience with our vendors has provided us confidence in their ability to produce consistent and quality instrumentation, reagents and materials.
In September 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, for Illumina to provide products and services that can be used for certain research and clinical activities, including certain sequencers, reagents, and other consumables for use with the Illumina sequencers, as well as service contracts for the maintenance and repair of the sequencers. The initial term of the supply agreement, as amended, continues until January 2033, and automatically renews for additional one-year terms thereafter unless either we or Illumina 
terminate the supply agreement for the other’s uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency-related events, or in the event a regulatory authority notifies such party that continued performance under the supply agreement would violate applicable laws or regulations. We may also terminate the supply agreement for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice.
Competition
Growing understanding of the importance of biomarkers linked with therapy selection and response is leading to more companies offering services in genomic profiling. The promise of liquid biopsy is also leading to more companies attempting to enter the space and compete with us. Our main competition is from diagnostic companies with products and services to profile genes in cancers based on either single-marker or comprehensive genomic profile testing, based on next-generation sequencing in either blood or tissue. 
Our competitors within the liquid biopsy space include Foundation Medicine, Inc., which was acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc. in 2018, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Illumina, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Invitae Corporation, and Sysmex Inostics. In addition, GRAIL, Inc., Natera, Inc., Exact Sciences Corp., and Freenome Holdings, Inc. among others, are our competitors in minimal residual disease testing and early screening testing.
Competitors within the broader genomics profiling space based on tissue include laboratory companies such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America and Quest Diagnostics, Inc., as well as companies such as Foundation Medicine, Inc., Caris Life Science and Myriad Genetics, Inc. that sell molecular diagnostic tests for cancer to physicians and have or may develop tests that compete with our tests. In addition, we are aware that certain of our customers are also developing their own tests and may decide to enter our market or otherwise stop using our tests.
In addition to developing kits, certain diagnostic companies also provide next-generation sequencing platforms that could be used for liquid biopsy testing. These include Illumina, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., and other companies developing next-generation sequencing platforms that are sold directly to biopharmaceutical companies, clinical laboratories and research centers. While many of the applications for these platforms are focused on research and development applications, each of these companies has launched and could continue to commercialize products focused on the clinical oncology market. These tests could include FDA-approved diagnostic kits, which can be sold to the clients who have purchased their platforms. 
Furthermore, many companies are developing information technology-based tools to support the integration of next-generation sequencing testing into the clinical setting. These companies may also use their own tests or others to develop an integrated system which could limit our access to certain networks.
The promise of liquid biopsy is also leading to more companies attempting to enter the space and compete with us. Over the last year, that has included new and accelerated development programs by a number of potential competitors, and increasing levels of merger and acquisition activity by both existing and new competitors.
We believe key competitive factors affecting our success are the price and performance of our products, evidence of clinical differentiation, support by KOLs, commercial competitiveness, turnaround time and scope and quality of payer contracts. Our Guardant Health Oncology Platform has developed strengths across five layers, which we believe form a barrier to entry and a competitive advantage. However, we cannot assure that we will continue to compete effectively on each of those layers and our competitive landscape may change over the next few years as a result of new competitors entering through investment and acquisition activity.
Intellectual property
Protection of our intellectual property is fundamental to the long-term success of our business. We seek to ensure that investments made into the development of our technology are protected by relying on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets (such as know-how), license agreements, confidentiality agreements and procedures, non-disclosure agreements, invention disclosure and assignment agreements and other contractual rights. 
Our patent strategy is focused on seeking coverage for our core technology, our digital sequencing platform, and specific follow-on applications and implementations for detecting and monitoring cancer or other diseases by determining genetic variations in patient samples. In addition, we file for patent protection on our on-going research 
and development particularly into early-stage cancer detection, including on pattern recognition based, for example, on analyzing our extensive patient blood sample database. 
Our patent portfolio includes owned and licensed patents and patent applications, generally falling into three broad categories:
•applications and patents relating to our digital sequencing platform, including claims directed to methods for sequencing cell-free DNA, identifying CNVs, SNVs, indels and fusions in cell-free DNA and techniques for enriching nucleic acid samples;
•applications and patents relating to detecting and monitoring cancer and other diseases by determining genetic variations in biological samples; and
•applications and patents relating to early-stage cancer detection.
Issued U.S. patents and their international counterparts currently in our patent portfolio that relate to various aspects of our technology and products are expected to expire between 2026 and 2037.
Our proprietary technology is also bolstered by our acquisition of, and procurement of licenses to, technologies developed by third parties. While we developed our digital sequencing platform internally, we believe the technologies underlying our licenses from third parties, which typically relate to improvements to next-generation sequencing technologies, are potentially valuable and of possible strategic importance to us or our competitors. Under some of these agreements, we are obligated to pay low single-digit percentage running royalties on net sales where the licensed technology is used in the product or service sold, subject to minimum annual royalties or fees in certain agreements.
Our customers and partners recognize us as being a leader in the liquid biopsy field. Thus, just as patent and trade secret protection is essential to protecting our technology, we believe that it is equally as important for us to protect our brand and identity. We have filed for trademark protection in our name, logo and initial products in the United States.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, laws of various foreign countries where our products are or expected to be sold may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.
We also rely on trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We have determined that certain technologies, such as aspects of our sample preparation methods and some bioinformatic analysis techniques, are better kept as trade secrets. To mitigate the chance of trade secret misappropriation, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to our trade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention disclosure and assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions they have developed while working for us.
Government regulations
Federal and state laboratory licensing requirements
Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of or assessment of health. CLIA requires that a laboratory hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations it performs and that it complies with, among other things, standards covering operations, personnel, facilities administration, quality systems and proficiency testing, which are intended to ensure, among other things, that clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. 
To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. Because we are a CAP accredited laboratory, CMS does not perform this survey and inspection and relies on our CAP survey and inspection. We also may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories 
performing less complex tests. In addition, a laboratory that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA may develop, manufacture, validate and use proprietary tests referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. CLIA requires analytical validation including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and establishment of a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to any testing we perform may change over time and any such changes could have a material effect on our business. 
CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. For example, state laws may require that nonresident laboratories, or out-of-state laboratories, maintain an in-state laboratory license to perform tests on samples from patients who reside in that state. As a condition of state licensure, these state laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures or facility requirements or prescribe record maintenance requirements. Because our laboratory is located in the State of California, we are required to and do maintain a California state laboratory license. We maintain a current license with NYSDOH for our laboratory. In addition, our laboratory is licensed in a few states where nonresident laboratories are required to obtain state laboratory licenses under certain circumstances, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Other states may currently have or adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which may require us to modify, delay or stop its operations in those states. 
Failure to comply with CLIA certification and state clinical laboratory licensure requirements may result in a range of enforcement actions, including certificate or license suspension, limitation, or revocation, directed plan of action, onsite monitoring, civil monetary penalties, criminal sanctions, and revocation of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid payment for its services, as well as significant adverse publicity.
CLIA and state laws and regulations, operating together, sometimes limit the ability of laboratories to offer consumer-initiated testing (also known as “direct access testing”). CLIA certified laboratories are permitted to perform testing only upon the order of an “authorized person,” defined as an individual authorized under state law to order tests or receive test results, or both. Many states do not permit persons other than licensed healthcare providers to order tests. We currently do not offer direct access testing and our CLIA tests may only be ordered by authorized healthcare providers.
Regulatory framework for medical devices in the United States
Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic devices, or IVDs. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, pre-market clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, marketing, promotion, sales, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees.
Device classification
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are 
subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and special controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA process, which is generally more costly and time-consuming than the 510(k) process. As part of the PMA process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. A PMA application must also provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
The investigational device exemption (IDE) process
In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and institutional review board, or IRB, approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin only after the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate IRBs at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
Such clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Such clinical trials must also comply with the FDA’s good clinical practice regulations for IRB approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
•patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
•patients do not comply with trial protocols;
•patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;
•patients experience adverse events;
•patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial;
•device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences;
•side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA’s view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing;
•institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
•third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations or other FDA or IRB requirements;
•third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA;
•we or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations;
•third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or we or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
•regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
•changes in government regulations or administrative actions;
•the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or
•the FDA concludes that our trial designs are unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
The 510(k) clearance process
Under the 510(k) clearance process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous pre-marketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. The de novo classification process is an alternate pathway to classify medical devices that are automatically classified into Class III but which are low to moderate risk. A manufacturer can submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. De novo classification may also be available after receipt of a “not substantially equivalent” letter following submission of a 510(k) to FDA. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a new submission in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing 510(k)-cleared device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in 
these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite application(s).
In addition, over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. In May 2019, the FDA solicited public feedback on these proposals. The FDA requested public feedback on whether it should consider certain actions that might require new authority, such as whether to sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. 
In September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA intends to develop and maintain a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.
The PMA process
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided and may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. 
Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
•the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
•the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;
•the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
•changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the 
PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support changes from the device covered by a PMA and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. New PMA applications or PMA supplements may also be required for modifications to approved diagnostic tests, including modifications to manufacturing processes, device labeling and device design, based on the findings of post-approval studies.
In late 2019, we submitted a PMA application to seek the FDA’s approval of our Guardant360 CDx test. In August 2020, the FDA approved the PMA application and our Guardant360 CDx test was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy test approved by the FDA to provide tumor mutation profiling for cancer patients with solid tumors.
FDA regulation of laboratory developed tests
Although the FDA regulates medical devices, including IVDs, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDCA and FDA regulations with respect to LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and are developed, validated and offered within a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory. 
Legislative and administrative proposals addressing oversight of LDTs were introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our LDTs or to develop and introduce new tests as LDTs. For example, in 2014 the FDA issued two draft guidance documents proposing a risk-based framework with respect to applying the FDA’s oversight over LDTs. The Framework Guidance stated that the FDA intended to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices. Thus, we believe the FDA planned to begin to enforce its medical device requirements, including premarket submission requirements, on LDTs that have historically been marketed without 
FDA premarket review and oversight. In November 2016, the FDA announced its intention not to finalize the 2014 draft guidance to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to LDTs and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. In January 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to LDT regulation.
The FDA could ultimately modify its current approach to LDTs in a way that would subject our products marketed as LDTs to the enforcement of regulatory requirements. 
Research use only or investigational use only devices
Some of our products are currently available for research use only, or RUO, or for investigational use only, or IUO, depending on the proposed application. An RUO device is an IVD that is in the laboratory research phase of development. RUO devices must bear prominent labeling stating: “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” An IUO device is an IVD that in the product testing phase of development. An IUO device must bear prominent labeling stating: “For Investigational Use Only. The performance characteristics of this product have not been established.” Neither RUO or IUO devices may be used in clinical practice, and such devices cannot be advertised or promoted for clinical or diagnostic purposes. Devices that are intended for RUO or IUO and are properly labeled as RUO or IUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and QSR requirements. A device labeled RUO or IUO but intended to be used 
diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO or IUO device, including how the device is marketed, when determining its intended use.
EAP (Expedited Access Program)/Breakthrough Devices Program
The EAP was a voluntary program for certain medical devices that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for life threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions that are subject to premarket submissions. Under the EAP, the FDA worked with device sponsors to try to reduce the time and cost from development to marketing decision without changing the FDA’s PMA standard of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness or any other standards of valid scientific evidence. Components of the EAP include priority review, more interactive review, senior management involvement, and assignment of a case manager. 
Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the Breakthrough Devices provisions were added to the FDCA. The Breakthrough Devices Program is a voluntary program intended to expedite the review, development, assessment and review of certain medical devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human diseases or conditions for which no approved or cleared treatment exists or that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives. For Breakthrough Devices, the FDA intends to provide interactive and timely communication with the sponsor during device development and throughout the review process. FDA also intends to assign staff to be available within a reasonable time to address questions by institutional review committees concerning the conditions and clinical testing expectations applicable to the investigational use of a Breakthrough Device. In addition, all submissions for devices designated as Breakthrough Devices will receive priority review, meaning that the review of the submission is placed at the top of the appropriate review queue and receives additional review resources, as needed. The Breakthrough Devices Program superseded the EAP and the previous priority review program for medical device submissions. The FDA has indicated that all participants previously granted EAP designation will have designation as breakthrough devices, and that no separate action will be necessary for sponsors of EAP-designated devices to receive breakthrough device designation for such devices. 
In January 2018, we received EAP designation from the FDA for our Guardant360 test. In December 2018, we received breakthrough device designation from the FDA for our GuardantOMNI test.

For certain of our tests, we are pursuing development as in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that may respond to our partners’ pharmaceutical products. Companion diagnostics are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA issued a final guidance document in July 2014 addressing agency policy in relation to in vitro companion diagnostic tests. The guidance explains that for some drugs and therapeutic biologics, the use of a companion diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, such as when the use of a product is limited to a specific patient subpopulation that can be identified by using the test. According to the guidance, the FDA generally requires the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic to be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products, and in December 2018, FDA issued a draft guidance describing considerations for the development and labeling of in vitro companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products.
In August 2020, our Guardant360 CDx test was approved by the FDA to be used as a companion diagnostic initially in connection with one therapeutic product of a biopharmaceutical customer. 
Pervasive and continuing FDA regulation
After a device enters commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;
•advertising and promotion requirements;
•restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;
•PMA annual reporting requirements;
•PMA approval of product modifications, or the potential for new 510(k) clearances for certain modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
•medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;
•an order of repair, replacement or refund;
•device tracking requirements; and
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions such as: warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; the FDA’s refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products; the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and criminal prosecution.
Foreign regulation of medical devices
Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation, including premarket review and marketing authorization, by similar agencies in other countries. Regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the United States but are not harmonized. International regulators are independent and not bound by the findings of the FDA and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept clinical trial design/results or may require additional data or other information not requested by the FDA. 
In the EU, in vitro diagnostic devices can be placed on the market by obtaining a “CE mark,” which we have obtained for our Guardant360 CDx test. CE marked products demonstrate conformity with the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (98/79/EC) (“IVDD”), which requirements include:
•Essential Requirements. The IVDD specifies “essential requirements” that all medical devices must meet to demonstrate the product is safe and effective under normal conditions of use. The requirements are similar to those adopted by the FDA relating to quality systems and product labeling.
•Conformity Assessment. The requirements to obtain a CE mark are risk-based and follow a similar classification system as in the United States. However, unlike the United States, which requires virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the FDA, the IVDD currently allows manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer self-certifies that the device conforms to the applicable essential requirements.
•Vigilance. The IVDD specifies requirements for post-market reporting similar to those adopted by the FDA.
On May 26, 2017, the EU released a new regulatory framework, the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (2017/746/EU) (“IVDR”), which will replace the IVDD. The IVDR comes into force on May 26, 2022 and imposes 
stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Until that time, our Guardant360 CDx test must continue to meet the requirements of IVDD for commercialization in the EU. Additionally, the effective date of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU was January 31, 2020 and so the United Kingdom will not be subject to the IVDR and has instead introduced its own regulatory framework. As a result, there is a new conformity marking solely for the United Kingdom and, as of January 1, 2021, any new products require a U.K. Conformity Assessed, or UKCA, mark, in addition to a CE mark. However, our existing product will be able to rely on the CE mark previously obtained during a transition period that will last until June 30, 2023.
In February 2021, Guardant Health Japan, an affiliate of the Joint Venture with SoftBank, submitted an application, currently under review, to Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (“MHLW”) for regulatory approval of Guardant360 CDx. To be sold in Japan, most medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval, or “shonin.” The Japanese government, through the MHLW, regulates medical devices under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (“PAL”). Oversight for medical devices is conducted with participation by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), a quasi-government organization performing many of the review functions for MHLW. Penalties for a company’s noncompliance with PAL can be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. MHLW and PMDA also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and product conformity to the requirements of the PAL. We are subject to compliance inspections by these agencies.
We will seek approvals in other countries as may be required in the future.
Federal and state fraud and abuse laws
We are subject to federal fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, the federal Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act, or EKRA, the federal prohibition against physician self-referral, or Stark Law, and the federal false claims law, or the False Claims Act, or FCA. We are also subject to similar state and foreign fraud and abuse laws.
The AKS prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce such person to refer an individual, or to purchase, lease, order, arrange for, or recommend purchasing, leasing or ordering, any good, facility, item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from an AKS violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
The EKRA prohibits knowingly and willfully soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for referring a patient or patronage to a laboratory; or paying or offering any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce a referral of an individual to a laboratory or in exchange for an individual using the services of that laboratory. The EKRA applies to all payers including commercial payers and government payers, and EKRA violations result in significant fines and/or up to 10 years in jail, separate and apart from existing AKS regulations.
The Stark Law and similar state laws, including California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, generally prohibit, among other things, clinical laboratories and other entities from billing a patient or any governmental or commercial payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has a direct or indirect investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. 
Other federal fraud and abuse laws to which we are subject include but are not limited to the federal civil and criminal false claims laws including the FCA, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, and the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. Under the FCA, private citizens can bring claims on behalf of the government through qui tam actions. We must also operate within the bounds of the fraud and abuse laws of the states in which we do business which may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.
Privacy and Security
Under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities. Covered entities and their business associates are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. Because we are a health care provider that electronically transmits health care information to payers, we are a covered entity under HIPAA. Our subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit or otherwise process PHI on our behalf must also comply with HIPAA as business associates thereunder. 
HIPAA and HITECH include the privacy and security rules, breach notification requirements and electronic transaction standards. The privacy rule covers the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and business associates. The privacy rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI except as permitted under the rule. The rule also sets forth individual patient rights, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing his or her PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of his or her PHI. The security rule requires covered entities and business associates to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically transmitted or stored PHI by implementing administrative, physical and technical safeguards. Under HITECH’s breach notification rule, a covered entity must notify individuals, the Secretary of the HHS, and in some circumstances, the media of breaches of unsecured PHI. 
If they are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about their privacy practices or an audit by HHS, entities may be subject to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if such entities are required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
In addition, we may be subject to state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA. California, for example, has enacted the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which sets forth standards in addition to HIPAA and HITECH with which all California health care providers like us must abide. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, was signed into law on June 28, 2018, and went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information. The CCPA authorizes private lawsuits to recover statutory damages for certain data breaches. Although the CCPA exempts protected health information regulated by HIPAA and certain data regarding clinical trials, the CCPA, to the extent applicable to our business and operations, may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we maintain about California residents. The CCPA has substantial penalties for non-compliance and we continue to assess its impact on our business. Complying with these various state laws and regulations, which may differ from state to state, requires significant resources and may complicate our compliance efforts. Penalties for violation of any of these laws and regulations may include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties.
U.S. healthcare reform 
In the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes at the federal and state levels which seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability 
Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, became law. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both commercial and government payers and contains a number of provisions expected to impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse.
Since its enactment, there have been efforts to repeal all or part of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On November 10, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in California vs. Texas to determine whether the entire ACA should be unenforceable nationwide or whether it should be unenforceable only to the extent that provisions injure the individual plaintiffs. It is unclear how the Supreme Court decision and efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact the ACA or our business. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. 
We anticipate there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and commercial payers to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Changes in healthcare coverage landscape could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our tests, the coverage of or the amounts of reimbursement available for our tests from payers, including commercial and government payers.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 864 full-time employees, of which approximately 853 are in the U.S., with the remainder in Europe and Canada. 
We strive to recruit, hire and retain a talented and diverse team of people who align with our values. Our employees are supported with training and development opportunities to pursue their career paths and to ensure compliance with our policies. Our compensation and benefits team strive to develop and implement policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. We provide our employees with competitive fixed and/or variable pay, competitive company equity programs, access to medical, dental and life insurance benefits, disability coverage, 401 (k) program, and numerous well-being benefits. In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives, we frequently utilize employee engagement surveys to understand the effectiveness of our employee development and compensation programs and where we can improve across the company. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we commit to safeguard the health of our employees, including their economic health. Steps we have taken include deep cleaning our facilities, providing personal protective equipment to our laboratory and scientific employees, installing plexi-glass, where possible, in our facilities, encouraging hygiene practices advised by health authorities, restricting business travel and site visitors and implementing remote working for all non-essential laboratory related employees. We developed our own proprietary COVID-19 test and make that test available to all Redwood City, California based employees and their dependents at no cost and leverage that testing as a condition for access to our offices. In addition, we have developed special cash compensation and incentive programs to many of our essential employees, in recognition of their outstanding service during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we extended COVID-19 protection pay for employees who were quarantined, sick or needed to provide care for their families. Further, despite the negative impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, we have not cut salaries or hourly rates for any employees.
