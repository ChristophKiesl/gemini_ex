Outlook
 
For the year 2017, we will continue to focus on strategic partnerships and innovative products that will further expand our services, positioning Net Element as a convenient one-stop solution for payments services to a global merchant community. We also intend to expand our presence in North America through distribution and integrated-services programs. In addition, we intend to further consolidate and centralize our international operational infrastructure and resources.
Our Mission and Vision
 
Our mission is to power global commerce and allow our clients to conduct business globally. We believe that understanding the consumer behavior and the needs of our merchants is the most effective and, ultimately, the most profitable means to accomplish our mission and create long-term value for all stakeholders.
 
We drive client growth through our in-depth knowledge of global transactional services and related value-added service offerings which separate us from the competition.
 
Our vision is to set the standard for omni-channel payments acceptance and value-added service offerings with focus on creation of unified global transaction acceptance ecosystem.

In order to achieve this vision, we seek to further develop single on-boarding, global transaction acceptance ecosystem. Manifesting this vision requires scaling our direct and indirect connectivity to multiple payment and mobile networks internationally. By operationalizing this vision, we believe that we will be able to provide centralized, global omni-channel transactional platform to our clients internationally.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to power global commerce through a world-wide, omni-channel solutions offering. To continue to grow our business, our strategy is to focus on providing merchants with the ability to process a variety of electronic transactions across multiple channels. We seek to leverage the adoption of and transition to card, electronic and digital-based payments by expanding our market share through our distribution channels and services innovations. We also seek growth through strategic acquisitions to improve our offerings, scale and geography. We intend to continue to invest in and leverage our technology infrastructure and our people to increase our penetration in existing markets.
 
Key elements of our business strategy include:
 

· | Continued investment in our core technology and new product offerings; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Allocation of resources and expertise to grow in commerce and payments segments; 
· | Grow and control our distribution by adding new merchants and partners; 
· | Leverage technology and operational advantages throughout our global footprint; 
· | Expansion of our cardholder and mobile subscriber customer base; 
· | Continue to develop seamless multinational solutions for our clients; 
· | Increase monetization while creating value for our clients; 
· | Focus on continued improvement and operation excellence; and 
· | Pursue potential domestic and international acquisitions of, investments in, and alliances with companies that have high growth potential, significant market presence or key technological capabilities. 

 
With our existing infrastructure and supplier relationships, we believe that we can accommodate expected portfolio growth. We believe that our available capacity and infrastructure will allow us to take advantage of operational efficiencies as we grow our processing volume and expand to other geographical territories.
 
Market Overview
 
The financial technology and transaction processing industry is an integral part of today’s worldwide financial structure. The industry is continually evolving, driven in large part by technological advances. The benefits of card-based payments allow merchants to access a broader universe of consumers, enjoy faster settlement times and reduce transaction errors. By using credit or debit cards, consumers are able to make purchases more conveniently, whether in person, over the Internet, or by mail, fax or telephone, while gaining the benefit of loyalty programs, such as frequent flyer miles or cash back, which are increasingly being offered by credit or debit card issuers.
 
In addition, consumers are also beginning to use card-based and other electronic payment methods for purchases at an earlier age in life, and increasingly for small dollar amount purchases. Given these advantages of card-based payment systems to merchants and consumers, favorable demographic trends, and the resulting proliferation of credit and debit card usage, we believe businesses will increasingly seek to accept card-based payment systems in order to remain competitive.
 
Our management believes that cash transactions are becoming progressively obsolete. The proliferation of bankcards has made the acceptance of bankcard payments a virtual necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, in order to remain competitive. In addition, the advent and growth of e-commerce have marked a significant new trend in the way business is being conducted. E-commerce is dependent upon credit and debit cards, as well as other cashless payment processing methods.
 
The payment processing industry continues to evolve rapidly, based on the application of new technology and changing customer needs. We intend to continue to evolve with the market to provide the necessary technological advances to meet the ever-changing needs of our market place. Traditional players in the industry must quickly adapt to the changing environment or be left behind in the competitive landscape.

North America Transaction Solutions Operations. Our largest segment, North America Transaction Solutions, where through our subsidiary TOT Payments, LLC, doing business as Unified Payments, provides businesses of all sizes and types with a wide range of solutions at the point of sale, including Merchant Acquiring, e-commerce, mobile commerce, mPOS and other business solutions. Our largest service in this segment is Merchant Acquiring, which facilitates the acceptance of cashless transactions at the POS, whether a retail transaction at a physical business location, a mobile commerce transaction through a mobile or tablet device, which includes m-POS acceptance, Android Pay™, Apple Pay™ and Samsung Pay or an electronic commerce transaction over the web. Geographical presence for this segment is North America.
 
Our North America Transaction Solutions segment revenues are primarily derived from processing credit and debit card transactions for SMB merchants and includes fees for providing processing, loyalty and software services, and sales and leases of POS devices. Revenues are generated from a variety of sources, including:
 

· | Discount fees charged to a merchant for processing of a transaction. The discount fee is typically either a percentage of the purchase amount or an interchange fee plus a fixed dollar amount or percentage; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Processing fees charged to merchants for processing of a transaction; 
· | Processing fees charged to our sales partners who have outsourced their transaction processing to us; 
· | Sales and leases of POS devices; 
· | Fees from providing reporting and other services;

* Does not include agent commission payments.
 
We typically provide our services as part of a broader payment acceptance solution to our business clients across multiple channels, including:
 

· | Retail Merchants – physical businesses or storefront locations, such as retailers, supermarkets, restaurants, hotels and other brick and mortar facilities, which we refer to as Retail. We supply our Retail merchants with POS terminals from leading manufacturers, which are Europay®, MasterCard®, and Visa® (commonly referred to as “EMV” or “Chip”) compliant and Near Field Communication (“NFC”) capable, accepting all card brands and products, as well as alternative payment forms, such as Android Pay™, Apple Pay™ and Samsung Pay. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

North America Transaction Solutions Marketing. We employ a variety of go-to-market strategies in our North America Transaction Solutions segment. We mostly partner with indirect non-bank sales forces (“Sales Partners”), such as independent sales agents, independent sales groups (“ISG”), independent software vendors (“ISV”), value added resellers (“VAR”), and payment services providers (“PSP”) to sell our payment solutions to SMB merchants. We believe that this sales approach provides us with access to an experienced sales force to market our services with limited investment in sales infrastructure and management time. We believe our focus on the unique needs of SMB allows us to develop compelling offerings for our sales channels to bring to prospective merchants and provides us with a competitive advantage in our target market.

Sales & Marketing Support – Among the services and capabilities, we provide are rapid application response time, merchant application acceptance by fax or online submission, superior customer service, merchant reporting and robust analytics. In addition, by controlling the underwriting process we believe we offer the ISGs more rapid and consistent review of merchant applications than may be available from other service providers. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we offer our sales organizations tailored compensation programs and unique technology applications to assist them in the sales process. We keep an open dialogue with our sales partners to address their concerns as quickly as possible and work with them in investigating chargebacks or potentially suspicious activity with the aim of ensuring our merchants do not unduly suffer downtime or the unnecessary withholding of funds.
Sales & Marketing Compensation – As compensation for their referral of merchant accounts, we pay our Sales Partners an agreed-upon recurring commission, or percentage of the income we derive from the transactions we process from the merchants they refer to us. The amount of the recurring commissions we pay to our Sales Partners varies on a case-by-case basis and depends on several factors, including but not limited to the number and type of merchants each group refers to us. We provide additional incentives to our Sales Partners, including from time to time, advances and merchant acquisition bonuses that are secured by income earned from the referred merchant and repayable from future compensation that may be earned by the groups in respect to the merchants they have referred to us. For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we provided merchant acquisition incentives to Sales Partners in an aggregate amount of $1.3 million and $0.87 million, respectively. Our organic growth plan calls for future incentives to be funded to our Sales Partners for referred merchants.
North America Transaction Solutions. Our solutions are designed to help SMB merchants accept cashless payments in an omni-channel payment environment, which spans across POS, e-commerce and mobile devices.
 
Aptito POS Platform – We acquired Aptito, an integrated POS platform developed on Apple’s® iOS mobile operating system for the hospitality industry, in June 2013 and invested in the technology to significantly enhance and expand its capabilities and features. Our goal with Aptito is to create an easy to use POS and business management solution, which incorporates everything a small business needs to help streamline every-day management, operations and payment acceptance. We have expanded the family of Aptito products to include Aptito Hospitality POS, Aptito Retail POS, Restoactive and Unified m-POS.
 

§ | Aptito Hospitality POS – proprietary, fully integrated cloud-based POS and restaurant management system developed on Apple’s® iOS mobile operating system is designed to be used as a stand-alone all digital POS or be extended to include: m-POS, self-ordering kiosk, digital menus, pay at the table EMV and NFC ready card readers, cash drawers, receipt and kitchen printers. The need for uptime in a hospitality environment is paramount and as such our Aptito Hospitality POS local server allows our merchants to remain online, even if the Internet connection to the cloud is lost. Our local server solution is automatically synchronized with the cloud, providing 99.99% uptime. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows retailers the ability to customize their POS solution based on their unique needs. The need for uptime in a retail environment is paramount and as such our Aptito Retail POS local server allows our merchants to remain online, even if the Internet connection to the cloud is lost. Our local server solution is automatically synchronized with the cloud, providing 99.99% uptime.

· | Restoactive – utilizing Aptito POS Platform architecture, we have developed and launched Restoactive, which seamlessly plugs into a current restaurant environment through integrations with some of the biggest POS and restaurant management platforms such as: MICROS®, POSitouch®, Aloha® and Symphony®. By integrating into the leading POS and restaurant management platforms, Restoactive is now accessible by over 500,000 restaurants in the United States. We believe Restoactive to be the first of its kind integrated platform, which introduces all-in-one digital menu, kiosk and m-POS application into an existing POS environment without the need to displace existing restaurant management platforms. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to enhancing our ability to drive core merchant acquiring sales, Aptito allows us to earn incremental revenue from business clients. Currently, the Aptito revenue model is based on a SaaS fee, which we bill on a per station basis and additional services fee, which we bill for additional applications we offer.
 
We also believe Aptito can help enhance client retention because we believe it will become core to our client’s businesses and position us as a value-added partner. For example, business owners may use Aptito business management tools to manage their employees’ work schedules, payroll, patron reservations, operate customer loyalty programs, manage inventory, and provide analytics on their business.

Other POS Platforms – We act as an authorized dealer for various POS manufacturers and POS software providers and deploy these systems where our proprietary products are not the best fit. Systems we offer are fully integrated with our payment acceptance capabilities.
Merchant Management Platform – We have developed Sales Central, a proprietary cloud-based management platform for merchants and sales partners (ISG’s) designed to enhance responsiveness of our sales partners and improve sales efficiency. The cloud-based solution provides Sales Partners and merchants an integrated toolkit to more effectively manage a variety of sales, operations, reporting and accounting functions. The system is designed to improve conversion rates, technology advisory functions and to reduce deployment time for merchants. It also allows troubleshooting of merchant issues in real-time. Sales Central is currently one of the few cloud-based systems nationwide that allows Sales Partners to onboard and monitor merchants on multiple processing platforms through a single interface.

· | Sales Central for Sales Partners – allows Sales Partners to onboard merchants on multiple processing platforms available in the U.S. Its merchant underwriting and boarding process is seamless and paperless. The merchant library portion of Sales Central allows Sales Partners to safely store and retrieve any agreement, form or contract, related to merchants. Sales Partners that utilize the system are equipped with merchant pricing, residual calculations and risk management modules, which allow easier management of most of their day-to-day operations. Sales Partners compensation and merchant profitability can be managed using multi-level, single-click, drill-down navigation to pricing, detail, summary and statement information.

North America Transaction Solutions Competition. Many large and small companies compete with us in providing payment processing services and related services to a wide range of merchants. Many of our current and prospective competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, more developed infrastructures, greater name recognition and/or more established relationships in the industry than we have. Because of this our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can, develop and expand their service offerings more rapidly, adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly, take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily, achieve greater economies of scale, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services. There are also many smaller transaction processors that provide various services to small and medium sized merchants.
 
We believe that our specific focus on smaller merchants, in addition to our understanding of the needs and risks associated with providing payment processing services to small merchants and indirect non-bank sales forces, gives us a competitive advantage over larger competitors, which have a broader market perspective and priorities. We also believe that we have a competitive advantage over competitors of a similar or smaller size that may lack our extensive experience, value-added product offering and resources.
 
North America Transaction Solutions Industry Mix and Geography. In the United States, we have developed significant expertise in industries that we believe present relatively low risks as the customers are generally present and the products or services are generally delivered at the time the transaction is processed. These include:

· | Restaurants 
--+---------------------------------
· | Schools and educational services
· | Brick and mortar retailers 
· | Convenience and liquor stores 
· | Professional service providers 
· | Hotel and lodging establishments

 
Merchants we served during 2016 processed an average of $11,804 each month in credit card transactions and had an average transaction value of $56.19 per transaction. Larger payment processors have traditionally underserved these merchants. As a result, these merchants have historically paid higher transaction fees than larger merchants and have not been provided with tailored solutions and on-going services that larger merchants typically receive from larger payment processing providers.

In December 2016, SMB merchants located in the following states represented the following percentage of our SMB card processing volume: New York represented 22.7%, New Jersey represented 22.2%, California represented 10.4%, Pennsylvania represented 7.5%, and Florida represented 5.6%. No other state represented more than 3.6% of our total SMB card processing volume. Our geographic concentration tends to reflect states where we maintain stronger sales force. We believe that the loss of any single SMB merchant would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
 
North America Transaction Solutions Risk Management. In the United States, we focus our sales efforts on both low and higher risk bankcard merchants. We have developed systems and procedures designed to minimize our exposure to potential merchant losses.
 Effective risk management helps us minimize merchant losses for the mutual benefit of our merchants, Independent Sales Groups and ourselves. Our Underwriting and Risk Management Policy and procedures help to protect us from fraud perpetrated by our merchants. We believe our knowledge and experience in dealing with attempted fraud has resulted in our development and implementation of effective risk management and fraud prevention systems and procedures. In 2016, we experienced net losses of .008% of our SMB card processing dollar volume.
 
We employ the following systems and procedures to minimize our exposure to merchant and transaction fraud:
 

· | Merchant Application Underwriting – there are varying degrees of risk associated with different merchant types based on their industry, the nature of the merchant’s business, processing volumes and average transaction size. As such, varying levels of scrutiny are needed to evaluate a merchant application and to underwrite a prospective merchant account. These range from basic due diligence for merchants with low risk profiles to more comprehensive review for higher risk merchants. The results of this assessment serves as the basis for decisions regarding acceptance of the merchant account, criteria for establishing reserve requirements, processing limits, average transaction amounts and pricing. Once aggregated, these factors also assist the Company in monitoring transactions for those accounts when pre-determined criteria have been exceeded. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Merchant Monitoring – we employ several levels of merchant account monitoring to help us identify suspicious transactions and trends. Daily merchant activity is sorted into a number of customized reports by our systems. Our risk management team reviews any unusual activity highlighted by these reports, such as larger than normal transactions or credits, and monitors other parameters that are helpful in identifying suspicious activity. We have daily windows to decide if any transactions should be held for further review and this provides us time to interview a merchant or issuing bank to determine the validity of suspicious transactions. We also place merchants who require special monitoring on alert status and have engaged a third-party web crawling solution that scans all merchant websites for content and integrity.

· | Investigation and Loss Prevention – if a merchant exceeds any parameters established by our underwriting and/or risk management staff or violates regulations established by the applicable bankcard network or the terms of our merchant agreement, one of our investigators will identify the incident and take appropriate action to reduce our exposure to loss and the exposure of our merchant. This action may include requesting additional transaction information, withholding or diverting funds, verifying delivery of merchandise or even deactivating the merchant account. Additionally, Relationship Managers may be instructed to retrieve equipment owned by us. In addition, to protect ourselves from unexpected losses, we maintain a reserve account with our sponsoring bank, which can be used to offset any losses incurred at a given time. As of December 31, 2016, our reserve balance, included in other long term assets, was $475,428. The reserve is replenished as required by funding 0.03% of bankcard processing volume. This reserve is accounted for on our balance sheet under the caption “prepaid expenses and other assets”. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reserves – some of our merchants are required to post reserves (cash deposits) that are used to offset chargebacks incurred. Our sponsoring banks hold such reserves related to our merchant accounts as long as we are exposed to loss resulting from a merchant’s processing activity. In the event that a small company finds it difficult to post a cash reserve upon opening an account with us, we may build the reserve by retaining a percentage of each transaction the merchant performs until the reserve is established. This solution permits the merchant to fund our reserve requirements gradually as its business develops. As of December 31, 2016, our total reserve deposits were approximately $2,600,357. We have no legal title to the cash accounts maintained at the sponsor bank in order to cover potential chargeback and related losses under the applicable merchant agreements. We also have no legal obligation to these merchants with respect to these reserve accounts. Accordingly, we do not include these accounts and the corresponding obligation to the merchants in our consolidated financial statements.

North America Transaction Solutions Sponsoring Banks and Data Processors. Because we are not a “member bank” as defined by Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover (“Card Associations”), in order to authorize and settle payment transactions for merchants, we must be sponsored by a financial institution that holds member bank status with Card Association (“Sponsorship Bank”) and various third-party vendors (“Data Processors”) to assist us with these functions. Card Association rules restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and require that these funds be in the possession of a Sponsorship Bank until the merchant is funded.
Sponsoring Bank. We have agreements with several banks that sponsor us for membership in the Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover card associations and settle card transactions for our merchants. These agreements allow us to use the banks’ identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number (“BIN”) for Visa transactions and Interbank Card Association (“ICA”) number for MasterCard transactions. The principal Sponsoring Bank through which we processed the majority of our transaction in the United States during 2016 was BMO Harris Bank, N.A. On November 1, 2016, we moved all of our processing from BMO Harris Bank, N.A. to Merrick Bank, N.A. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into a BIN sponsorship agreement with Esquire Bank, N.A. As a result of our settlement with First Data, in 2016, we entered into a sponsoring agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. From time to time, we may enter into agreements with additional banks.
 
Data Processor. We have agreements with several Data Processors to provide us with, on a non-exclusive basis, transaction processing and transmittal, transaction authorization and data capture, and access to various reporting tools. Our primary processing vendor in the United States is Priority Payment Systems, LLC (“Priority”), which provides us with the processing conduit to the Total System Services, Inc. (“TSYS”) and First Data Corporation (“FDC”) authorization and settlement network. We have entered into several service agreements with Priority. Each of the Priority service agreements may be terminated by Priority if, among other things, (i) certain insolvency events occur with respect to us or (ii) we fail to maintain our good standing with Card Associations. We may terminate each of the agreements if, among other things, (i) certain insolvency events occur with respect to Priority, (ii) Priority materially breaches any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the agreements and fails to cure such breach within 30 days following receipt of written notice thereof, or (iii) under certain circumstances, Priority is unable to perform services described in the agreement. In addition, we maintain direct processing agreements with TSYS and FDC.
 
As an example of processing an electronic payment, the below diagram illustrates the participants involved in a payment transaction. There are four main participants, the Merchant, the Service Provider (Unified Payments), the Sponsoring Bank and the Data Processor. Merchants are primarily business owners that accept credit card payment in exchange for their merchandise and services.

Mobile Solutions Operations. In international markets (especially the Russian Federation and the CIS), we hold leadership position through our subsidiary, Digital Provider, where we enable Direct Carrier Billing utilizing billing infrastructure between Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”) and content providers to facilitate content monetization. In the Russian Federation and CIS through agreements and integrations with marketing companies owned by the top 4 MNOs including Mobile TeleSystem (MTS), MegaFon, VimpelCom and TELE2, we enable mobile payments acceptance for networks that serve a combined 390 million mobile users.

Our total Mobile Solutions transactions processed for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 73.3 million, a 19% decrease from transactions processed during the year ended December 31, 2015. Decrease in transactions processed was a result of shifted business model from one-time transactional business to subscription / recurring revenue model.
 
Our Carrier Billing Solution is positioned in the center of the mobile commerce for digital goods and services with billing checkout and offers various mobile payment solutions for web services and mobile applications. We enable monetization for digital content providers through smartphones, feature phones or web without a credit card or a bank account. Utilizing the source of funds that MNOs have already integrated into every mobile phone (a monthly bill for post-paid phones and stored credit for prepaid phones), merchants won’t need to collect any customer credit card or bank information to complete their sale. Our mobile campaign tools allow for the delivery of scalable mobile campaigns on behalf of our content partners.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Discount fees charged to a merchant for processing of a transaction. The discount fee is a percentage of the purchase; 
· | Processing fees charged to merchants for processing of a transaction; and 
· | Software license fees for Trinity Mobile Billing Platform. 

 
For example, in a transaction using a mobile device as a form of payment, the allocation of funds resulting from a $10 transaction from our branded content follows.
 


Mobile Solutions Marketing. We employ a variety of go-to-market strategies in our Mobile Solutions segment. We mostly partner with mobile operators, broadcast media networks, internet portals and content providers, and marketing and sales promotion partners.

· | Mobile Operators – Mobile operators partner with us to generate revenues for incoming traffic. Mobile operators increase revenues via additional subscription and transactional services used by its subscribers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Internet Portals and Content Providers – Mobile operator billing adds a further dimension to the offering of portals and content providers. It enables information alerts, ringtones and logos, Short Messaging Service (“SMS”) sending capabilities for end-users, all of which can generate revenues for the Company.

Its immediacy; directness and 2-way communication lends itself to effective measurable marketing and promotion.

Other industries using mobile messaging and mobile billing solutions include banking, retailing, brokering, tourism, transportation, games, and education.

Trinity Mobile Billing Platform – We have developed the Trinity Platform as a proprietary high-performance mobile acceptance, billing and content aggregation platform for value-added services (“VAS”). Using the Platform, our partners can aggregate mobile traffic utilizing the most popular methods of monetization on the VAS market.

· | Secure ID – Securely identify and validate subscriber handsets automatically with no additional input required from consumers. Provides subscribers a seamless cross channel shopping and registration experience across personal computers, tablets, smartphones, and other web-enabled devices. This is available for both recurring subscriptions and one-time transactions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | PIN Submit – Securely authenticates mobile subscribers by generating a one-time secure Personal Identification Number (“PIN”), which is sent to mobile users via SMS. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimized Checkout – Payment conversion with carrier billing is currently ten times higher than with credit cards due to a much simpler check-out flow. We have taken this one step further as the Trinity Platform automatically recognizes the device being used and optimizes the checkout window to provide the best purchase experience possible on any device. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In-App Payments – Industry-leading native in-app purchasing SDK (software development kit) enables application developers to integrate direct-carrier billing into applications with ease. One integration process works across multiple smartphone and tablet devices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This data helps our digital merchants and content providers fine-tune their monetization strategy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile Solutions Competition. Digital Provider primarily competes with other companies operating in the mobile payment processing market in emerging markets. Certain competitors have been in business longer than Digital Provider and have significantly greater financial and other resources than Digital Provider. In order to successfully increase our business in that market, we must convince content providers to use Digital Provider’s services over competitive platforms that may already be in use. Digital Provider must also retain good relations with MNOs providing service. We believe that Digital Provider will be able to effectively compete in the mobile payment processing market in Russia based primarily upon services offered, functionality and ease of use of features offered. Failure to successfully continue developing Digital Provider’s payment processing operations, maintain Digital Provider’s existing contracts with MNOs and content providers and enter into additional contracts with content providers to use Digital Provider’s services may harm our revenue and business prospects.
Mobile Solutions Risk Management. We are responsible for content compliance and merchant underwriting and are subject to chargebacks for the full value of the transaction. If any such chargebacks arise we pass these chargebacks to our merchants, in the event we are unsuccessful in passing these charges to the merchant we are responsible for these chargebacks. During 2016 and 2015 we had no losses from our mobile payments processing volume as all chargebacks were collected from content partners and aggregators.
Mobile Solutions Licensing and Certifications. The relationships between Digital Provider and telecommunications carriers in Russia are governed by the general rules of civil law for the provision of services (Chapter 39 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). In addition, because the “information and entertainment services” (content services) provided by Digital Provider are inextricably linked with the networks of telecommunications carriers, these services are subject to the requirements of the Rules of Mobile Communications Services Provision, approved by the Decree No. 328 of the Russian Federation Government dated May 25, 2005. These Rules govern the relationship between a customer using mobile communication services and a telecommunications carrier in respect of mobile radio communications services, mobile radiotelephone services and/or mobile satellite radio services in the public network. Although Digital Provider is not a telecommunications carrier, many requirements of the decree above are present in Digital Provider’s contracts with telecommunications carriers. 
Mobile Solutions Mobile Network Operators. In order for us to provide payment and SMS messaging services to mobile subscribers and debit their accounts for payments, we need to have contractual agreements with marketing subsidiaries of mobile operators, which allow us to bill mobile subscribers. We have direct and indirect agreements with mobile operators and mobile operator aggregators in over 40 countries. In addition, we also have contracts and our platform is integrated with various mobile operator aggregators, which give us access to mobile operator networks in approximately 50 countries.

Proprietary fraud filters and anti-fraud BIN monitoring allows disabling and filtering acceptance of virtual pre-paid cards.
 
Effective risk management helps us minimize merchant losses for the mutual benefit of our merchants and ourselves. Our Anti-Fraud System allows us to identify and prevent up to 99.98% of potential fraud related to bankcard processing in the electronic commerce environment. Our Underwriting and Risk Management Policy and procedures help to protect us from fraud perpetrated by our merchants. 154 different fraud filters allow our clients to maintain high level or payment conversion, averaging at 98.7%, while maintaining chargeback related losses as low as 0.023%. Our risk management is conducted in both manual and automatic modes. 
 
Manual Risk Management involves specialists of our Underwriting and Risk Management Department, who are responsible for the following:
 

· | Analysis of risks and underwriting of our partners, i.e. acquiring banks, financial companies and payment processors

Online Solutions Sponsoring Banks and Data Processors. Because we are not a “member bank” or a licensed financial services institution as defined by Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover (“Card Associations”), in order to authorize and settle payment transactions for merchants, we must be partner with a financial institution that holds member bank status with Card Association (“Partner Bank”) and various third-party vendors (“Data Processors”) to assist us with these functions. Card Association rules restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and require that these funds be in the possession of a Partner Bank until the merchant is funded.
Partner Bank. Since 2008, PayOnline has been working to increase the number of partnership agreements and platform integrations with different banks, financial institutions and payment processors. Our worldwide expansion requires a broader range of regions and currencies covered by such partnership agreements, enabling us to provide international payment processing.

Corporate History
 
Our Company was formed in 2010 and incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability under the name Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd. (“Cazador”). Cazador was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger; share capital exchange; asset acquisition; share purchase; reorganization or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets. In 2012, Cazador completed a merger (the “Merger”) with Net Element, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was a company with businesses in the online media and mobile commerce payment processing markets. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, the Company (then known as Cazador) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by discontinuing as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Effective upon consummation of the Merger, (i) Net Element, Inc. was merged with and into the Company, resulting in Net Element ceasing to exist and the Company continuing as the surviving company in the Merger, and (ii) the Company changed its name to Net Element International, Inc. In 2013, the Company divested its non-core entertainment assets. In December 2013, the Company changed its name to Net Element, Inc. We entered the mobile payments business through the launch of Tot Money (renamed Digital Provider in 2015) in Russia in 2012. We entered the financial technology and value-added transactional service business through the acquisitions of Unified Payments in April 2013 and Aptito in June 2013. We entered the online payment business with our acquisition of PayOnline in May 2015. Our principal office is located at 3363 NE 163rd Street, Suite 705, North Miami Beach, Florida 33160, and our main telephone number is (305) 507-8808.
 
Regulation
 
Various aspects of our business are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state and local regulation. The operations of our subsidiary, Digital Provider, are subject to regulation in non-U.S. markets it operates in and may become subject to the laws and regulations of additional foreign jurisdictions as and when its business expands into additional markets. Many domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and companies transmitting user information and payments via text message or other electronic means are still evolving and the interpretation of such laws and regulations are often uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and/or fines. The services of Digital Provider to mobile phone carriers also are subject to certain of the rules and policies of such carriers and ongoing contractual covenants with such carriers, the violation of which may result in penalties and/or fines and possible termination of Digital Provider’s services. Certain of our services are also subject to rules set by various payment networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, as more fully described below under “Association and Network Rules”.
Association and Network Rules. While not legal or governmental regulation, we are subject to the network rules of Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks. In order to provide processing services, a number of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa and/or MasterCard as service providers for member institutions. Various subsidiaries of ours are also processor level members of numerous networks or are otherwise subject to various network rules in connection with processing services and other services we provide. As such, we are subject to applicable card association, networks and national scheme rules that could subject us to fines or penalties. The payment networks routinely update and modify their requirements. On occasion, we receive notices of non-compliance and fines, which might be related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures. Our failure to comply with the networks’ requirements or to pay the fines they impose could cause the termination of our registration and require us to stop providing payment services.

Dodd-Frank Act. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to regulate consumer financial services, including many offered by our clients.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act provided two self-executing statutory provisions limiting the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions that became effective in July 2010. The first provision allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards). The second provision allows merchants to provide discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers.
 
Separately, the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Payment network fees, such as switch fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. In July 2011, the Federal Reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees. Effective in October 2011, debit interchange rates for card issuing financial institutions with more than $10 billion of assets are capped at $0.21 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction’s value to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuing financial institutions, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. The debit interchange fee would be $0.24 per transaction on a $38 debit card transaction, the average transaction size for debit card transactions. In July 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia determined that the Federal Reserve’s regulations implementing the Durbin Amendment were invalid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or D.C. Circuit, reversed this decision on March 21, 2014, generally upholding the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve’s rules implementing it. On August 18, 2014, the plaintiffs in this litigation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit’s decision with respect to the interchange fee cap. We continue to monitor developments in the litigation surrounding these rules. Regardless of the outcome of the litigation, the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations.
 
In addition, the new rules contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions. Beginning in October 2011, (i) a card payment network may not prohibit a card issuer from contracting with any other card payment network for the processing of electronic debit transactions involving the issuer’s debit cards and (ii) card issuing financial institutions and card payment networks may not inhibit the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any card payment networks that can process the transactions. Since April 2012, most debit card issuers have been required to enable at least two unaffiliated card payment networks on each debit card. We do not expect the prohibition on network exclusivity to impact our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our clients. These regulatory changes create both opportunities and challenges for us. Increased regulation may add to the complexity of operating a payment processing business, creating an opportunity for larger competitors to differentiate themselves both in product capabilities and service delivery.
 
Federal Trade Commission Act and Other Laws Impacting our Customers’ Business. All persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or UDAP. In addition, there are other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant’s payment processor, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the states’ attorney general have authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.
Rules and Policies of and Contractual Covenants with Mobile Phone Carriers. While not governmental regulation, Digital Provider is subject to certain of the rules and policies of mobile phone carriers to which Digital Provider provides payment processing services and ongoing contractual covenants with such mobile phone carriers. The mobile phone carriers may from time to time update or otherwise modify or supplement their rules and policies. Digital Provider periodically is subject to the imposition of fines or penalties as a result of failure to comply with such rules, policies and/or contractual covenants. Digital Provider’s failure to comply with the mobile phone carriers’ respective requirements or to pay the fines or penalties they impose could result in the termination of Digital Provider’s services.
 
Laws and Rules of the Russian Federation. The relationships between Digital Provider (formerly known as TOT Money) and telecommunications carriers in Russia are governed by the general rules of civil law for the provision of services (Chapter 39 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). In addition, because the “information and entertainment services” (content services) provided by Digital Provider are inextricably linked with the networks of telecommunications carriers, these services are subject to the requirements of the Rules of Mobile Communications Telephone Services Provision, approved by the Decree No. 328 of the Russian Federation Government dated December 9, 2014. These rules govern the relationship between a customer using mobile communication services and a telecommunications carrier in respect of mobile radio communications services, mobile radiotelephone services and/or mobile satellite radio services in the public network. Although Digital Provider is not a telecommunications carrier, many requirements of such Rules are present in Digital Provider’s contracts with telecommunications carriers, and such contracts impose responsibility and liability on Digital Provider for violations.

Digital Provider has a license for the provision of telematics services in Russia. Digital Provider is considered an operator of telematics services in Russia because it has a direct connection to equipment of telecommunications carriers and it affects electronic communications (i.e., receiving, processing and/or transmitting electronic messages). Operators of telematics services in Russia are regulated by the Federal Law “On Communication” dated July 2, 2003 No. 126-FZ. This Federal Law provides the legal basis for activity in the field of communications in the Russian Federation and territories under the Russian Federation jurisdiction, defines the powers of public authorities in the field of communications, as well as the rights and responsibilities of persons involved in such activities or using communication services. Digital Provider also is subject to the Rules of Telematics Services Provision approved by the Decree of the Russian Federation Government dated September 10, 2007 No. 575. These Rules govern the relationship between a customer or a user, on the one hand, and a telecommunications carrier providing telematics communication services, on the other hand, in the provision of telematics communication services.   
 
The activity of Digital Provider to some extent is regulated by the Federal Law “On Operational and Investigative Activities” dated August 12, 1995 No. 144-FZ. This Federal Law determines the content of the operational and investigative activities in the Russian Federation, and provides for a system of guarantees in the process of operational and investigative operations. Operational and investigative activities include activities carried out openly and secretly by operational branches of certain government bodies in order to protect life, health, rights and freedoms of the person and the citizen, property, security of the society and the state from criminal attacks.
 
In carrying out activities on the Internet in Russia, Digital Provider is subject to the Federal Law “On Advertising” dated March 13, 2006 No. 38-FZ. The objectives of this Federal Law are the development of markets for goods and services based on the principles of fair competition, ensuring the common economic space in the Russian Federation, the realization of the rights of consumers to receive fair and accurate advertising, creating favorable conditions for the production and distribution of public service announcements, preventions of violations of the Russian Federation on advertising, as well as the suppression of improper advertising. Digital Provider’s activities on the Internet in Russia also are subject to the Federal Law “On Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Health” dated December 29, 2010 No. 436-FZ. This Federal Law provides regulations protecting children from information harmful to their health and/or development.
 
Concerning relations with Federal communication service providers, Digital Provider can be involved in regulation of personal data of subscribers. In case of transferring by Federal communication service providers’ information which includes personal data Digital Provider has to take measures to protect such data as the operator of personal data must take. The list of such measures is described in Federal Law “On Personal Data” dated 27.07.2006 No 152. This Federal Law and Federal Law “On Communication” establish rules of usage of personal data of subscribers. Taking into account that this regulation is to be applied only in case of transferring information with personal data from Federal communication service providers it is important to clarify that common execution of contracts with these providers do not stipulate transferring of personal data.
 
Business activities of PayOnline in Russian Federation are governed by the general rules of civil law (for example, Chapter 39 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation) and by special laws, such as the Federal Law of June 27, 2011 N 161-FZ «On the National Payment System», Federal Law of 27.07. 2006 N 152-FZ "On Personal Data".
 
In the framework of the Federal Law of June 27, 2011, No. 161-FZ "On the National Payment System", PayOnline activities are regarded as the activities of the "operation center" (Article 17), which aims to ensure the exchange of electronic messages between billing participants in accordance with the rules of the payment system.
 
It should also be noted that in connection with the introduction of changes to the law that came into force on September 1, 2015, according to which all personal data of individuals - citizens of the Russian Federation, should be collected, processed and stored on the territory of the Russian Federation. PayOnline was forced to terminate long-term relations with the New York data center Stafford and transfer all servers to the territory of the Russian Federation.
 
Federal Law No. 152-FZ of July 27, 2006 "On Personal Data" as a whole regulates the activities of absolutely all organizations that process personal data of individuals. PayOnline, following the requirements of the law, registered as a personal data operator in Roskomnadzor under the number: 10-0104880.
 
Other Laws and Regulations

Since we collect certain information from members and users on our platform, it will be subject to current and future government regulations regarding the collection, use and safeguarding of consumer information over the Internet and mobile communication devices. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection and electronic payment services. In many cases, it may be unclear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet or mobile communication services as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of these technologies and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet and e-commerce.

There are a number of legislative proposals that are anticipated or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us. Many states, for example, have already passed laws requiring notification to subscribers when there is a security breach of personal data. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
 
Legislation could be passed that limits our ability to use or store information about our users. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and various states have established regulatory guidelines issued under the Federal Trade Commission Act and various state acts, respectively, that govern the collection, use and storage of consumer information, establishing principles relating to notice, consent, access and data integrity and security. Our practices are designed to comply with these guidelines. For example, we disclose that we collect a range of information about our users, such as their names, email addresses, search histories and activity on our platform. We also use and store such information primarily to personalize the experience on our platforms, provide customer support and display relevant advertising. While we do not sell or share personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes, we do have relationships with third parties that may allow them access to user information for other purposes.
 
We believe our policies and practices comply with the FTC privacy guidelines and other applicable laws and regulations. However, if our belief proves incorrect, or if these guidelines, laws or regulations or their interpretations change or new legislation or regulations are enacted, we may be compelled to provide additional disclosures to our users, obtain additional consents from our users before collecting or using their information or implement new safeguards to help our users manage our (or others’) use of their information, among other changes.
 
Seasonality

Historically, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Revenues have been weaker during the first quarter of the calendar year and stronger during the second, third and fourth quarters. We expect our business to continue experiencing seasonal fluctuations consistent with this historical pattern.
