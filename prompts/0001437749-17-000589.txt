ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
 
AmeriCann's business plan is to offer a comprehensive, turnkey package of services that includes consulting, design, construction and financing to approved and licensed marijuana operators throughout the United States. Our business plan is based on the anticipated growth of the regulated marijuana market in the United States.
 
AmeriCann’s team includes board members, consultants, engineers and architects who specialize in real estate development, traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, medical research, facility construction, regulatory compliance, security, marijuana cultivation and genetics, extraction processes, and infused product development. 
 
 To support local businesses that seek to serve cannabis patients in their communities we initiated the AmeriCann Preferred Partner Program. Currently, we have one Preferred Partner in Colorado, which is 4900 Jackson, LLC and one Preferred Partner in Massachusetts, which is Coastal Compassion, Inc. Through this program, we plan to provide an essential set of resources including advanced cultivation facilities, access to a team of experts and in certain cases, capital for our partner’s businesses. In addition, AmeriCann’s team has assisted applicants in obtaining cannabis licenses in competitive application processes in Massachusetts and Illinois. This support is designed to assist our Preferred Partners in newly regulated markets.
 
AmeriCann plans to lease facilities to its Preferred Partners that will be designed with AmeriCann’s propriety cultivation and processing system called “Cannopy.” AmeriCann developed Cannopy with experts from traditional horticulture, lean manufacturing, regulatory compliance and cannabis cultivation. Cannopy includes automation throughout the production life-cycle, customized workflow processes, monitoring and controls, and top-line security systems. Cannopy empowers Preferred Partners to consistently produce medical marijuana for patients at the lowest cost in the most efficient, compliant manner. We provide initial and on-going training, policies, practices and procedures to operate the state-of-the-art facilities.
 
The expanding cannabis industry requires extensive real estate to meet the growing needs of the market for cannabis products. AmeriCann assists our Preferred Partners with the identification, design, permitting, acquisition, development and operation of scalable infrastructure to cultivate and to dispense medical cannabis in regulated markets. 
 
Company History
 
AmeriCann, Inc. ("the Company" or "the Issuer") was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 25, 2010. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP"). Under AP's Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, the Company was incorporated to: (i) receive and own any interest which AP had in the development of an MRI scanning facility; and (ii) issue shares of its common stock to AP's general unsecured creditors, to its administrative creditors, and to its shareholders.
 
Lacking the resources to effectively develop an MRI facility, in June 2012 the Company decided to promote medical tourism by providing information on a website for those seeking to travel abroad for healthcare services. The Company planned to generate revenue by selling advertising to healthcare providers and related businesses including hotels and travel agencies.

In September 2013, the Company abandoned its business plan relating to promoting medical tourism.
 
 On January 17, 2014, Strategic Capital Partners, LLC (“SCP”) a firm controlled by Benjamin J. Barton, one of our officers and directors, acquired 14,950,000 shares of our outstanding common stock from a group of our shareholders.
 
On February 21, 2014, we changed our name from Nevada Health Scan, Inc. to AmeriCann, Inc. and declared a stock dividend in the amount of four shares of common stock for each issued and outstanding share of common stock.
 
 On February 24, 2014, SCP returned 65,750,000 shares of our common stock to us. These shares were cancelled and returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares.
 
During March and April 2014, we sold 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to private investors at a price of $0.75 per share. Benjamin J. Barton, one of our officers and directors, purchased 400,000 shares as an investment.
 
 During July 2014, we raised $2,373,000 through a private sale of 791,000 Units at a price of $3.00 per Unit. Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant. Each warrant allows the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $8.00 per share anytime on or before April 30, 2018. Benjamin J. Barton purchased 666,667 Units for cash as an investment. We have offered the holders of the Series A Warrants 1.5 shares of common stock in exchange for each Series A Warrant. If all Series A Warrants are exchanged, the total shares outstanding will increase by 1,186,500. As of December 28, 2016, no shares of common stock had been issued in exchange for the Series A Warrants.
 
4900 Jackson, LLC
 
 During the summer of 2014 we entered into a Financing and Consulting Agreement with a licensed Colorado cannabis cultivator. The agreements called for us to loan $1,000,000 to the Preferred Partner, 4900 Jackson, LLC, to convert an existing 15,000 square foot warehouse into a new cannabis growing and processing facility.  The growing and processing facility was completed in 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, we have received $1,158,000 in principal, interest and consulting payments from the operator of the facility. These payments are scheduled to continue through May of 2017. 
 
Monaco Street Property
 
 On July 31, 2014, we closed on an all cash purchase of a five-acre parcel of land located in north central Denver, Colorado. The total purchase price for the property was $2,250,000.  The property is currently zoned for cannabis cultivation and processing by the City and County of Denver. We received concept approval from the City and County of Denver for the construction of a 125,000 square foot cannabis cultivation, processing, and administration facility on this property.  We estimate the cost to construct this facility will be approximately $12,500,000.  This property serves as collateral for a $990,000 loan which is due and payable on March 15, 2017. This property is held for resale, and we have no plans to develop on it.
Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center
 
On January 14, 2015, we entered into an agreement to purchase a 52.6 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Freetown, Massachusetts. The property is located approximately 47 miles southeast of Boston. We plan to develop the property as the Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Center "MMCC". Plans for the MMCC include the construction of sustainable greenhouse cultivation and processing facilities that will be leased to Registered Marijuana Dispensaries under the Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Program. Additional plans for the MMCC may include a testing laboratory, a research facility, a training center, an infused product production facility and corporate offices.  
 
On December 8, 2015, The Town of Freetown Planning Board unanimously approved our site plan application for the MMCC.  The site plan application requested 977,000 square feet of infrastructure for medical marijuana cultivation, processing, testing and associated administration in Freetown's Industrial Park.  
 
On March 29, 2016, the Department of Public Health (“DPH”) for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts approved our consulting agreement and development agreement relating to the MMCC's first tenant and Preferred Partner, Coastal Compassion, Inc. 
 
On April 7, 2016, we signed agreements with Coastal Compassion Inc. (“CCI”). CCI is one of a limited number of non-profit organizations that has received a provisional or final registration to cultivate, process and sell medical cannabis by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. CCI has agreed to become the initial tenant in our planned MMCC. Tim Keogh, our Chief Executive Officer, is a Board Member of CCI. 
 
Pursuant to the agreements, we agreed to provide CCI with financing of up to $2.5 million for a five-year term at 18% interest per year for construction and working capital required for CCI’s approved dispensary and cultivation center in Fairhaven, MA. For a three- year period beginning April 1, 2016, we agreed to consult with CCI in the design, construction and operation of the Fairhaven facility. CCI will pay us $10,000 each month for these consulting services. The DPH has approved our agreement with CCI relating to the consulting, the loan, and the development and lease terms for Building A of the MMCC.

 On October 17, 2016, we closed the acquisition of the 52.6-acre parcel of land in Freetown, Massachusetts. The deposits of $925,000 previously paid by us to the seller, Boston Beer Company (“BBC”), were credited against the total purchase price of $4,475,000. The remaining balance of $3,550,000 was paid to BBC by Massachusetts Medical Properties, LLC (“MMP”). 
 
 As part of a simultaneous transaction, we assigned the property rights to MMP for a nominal fee, and entered into a lease agreement in which MMP agreed to lease the property to us for an initial term of fifty years. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for four additional ten year periods. The lease is a triple net lease, whereby we will pay all real estate taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance.
 
The lease payments will be the greater of (a) $30,000 per month; (b) $0.38 per square foot per month of any structure built on the property; or (c) 1.5% of all gross monthly sales of products sold by us, any of our assignees, or any of our subtenants. The lease payments will be adjusted up (but not down) every five years by any increase in the Consumer Price Index.
 
Between October 17, 2016 and April 17, 2017, the monthly lease payments will accrue, with all accrued lease payments to be paid to MMP on April 17, 2017. 
 
 Under the terms of the lease, we have six months to obtain capital funding for the construction of the first phase building. In the event that we are unable to raise these funds within this six month period, we have an additional six month period to do so; provided, that we have paid accrued lease payments and closing costs. If we are then unable to raise the funds on or before twelve months from October 17, 2016, the lease will terminate.
 
We will receive credit for the $925,000 paid towards the purchase price in the form of discounted lease payments. For the initial fifty (50) year term of the lease, the lease payments will be reduced by $1,541.67 each month.

Market Conditions
 
According to ArcView Market Research’s 4th Edition of The State of Legal Marijuana Markets report, “The strong growth in demand for legal cannabis over the past two years is expected to continue in the years ahead. Twenty-eight states already permit medical cannabis use and eight states and the District of Columbia have passed ballot measures to allow for full adult use of cannabis. With 8 of 9 ballot measures for medical and adult-use cannabis laws passing in November, 2016 has proven to be a significant year for the cannabis industry. A majority of U.S. states have transitioned from cannabis prohibition to some form of regulated legal markets.”   Sales of legal medical and adult use marijuana were $4.6 billion in 2014, $5.7 billion in 2015 and are expected to grow to $22.8 billion by 2020. The cannabis industry was the fastest growing industry in the United States between 2014 and 2015 (74% growth) and is projected to grow faster than any other industry in the country over the next decade.

 While the industry is growing rapidly, the cannabis industry faces four major obstacles that challenge its growth and profitability. First, the cultivation of cannabis is a very capital-intensive enterprise. Many cannabis entrepreneurs do not have access to the capital required to build the infrastructure required to meet growing demand and sales projections. Traditional sources of financing, such as banks, are not available currently to cannabis producers and retailers. Second, there is a significant shortage of knowledge related to virtually all areas of the cannabis business. When new states are added to the list of regulated cannabis markets, there will be a scarcity of experience and expertise to serve the needs of growers and retailers in these states. Third, the majority of states do not allow access to medical cannabis for its patients. This presents an obstacle to the medical cannabis industry and requires financial resources and dedicated advocacy to change regulations on the state level. Fourth, as explained below, marijuana is illegal under federal law.
 
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law.  Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse.  The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.”  If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
As of December 28, 2016, 28 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana.  Additionally, voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, Nevada, California, Massachusetts, Maine and the District of Columbia approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for recreational use by adults.  The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana.   However, there is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of such federal laws. Additionally, the Trump administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly.  Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.  While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal government or the enactment of new and more restrictive laws.
 
Competition
 
Currently, there are a number of other companies that are involved in the marijuana industry, many of which we consider to be our competition. Many of these companies provide services similar to those which we provide or plan to provide.  We expect that other companies will recognize the value of serving the marijuana industry and become our competitors.
General
 
Our offices are located at 3200 Brighton Blvd., Unit 144 Denver, CO 80216. We lease this space located on a month-to-month basis at a rate of $2,870 per month.
 
 As of September 30, 2016, we had two full time employees, that being Timothy Keogh, our Chief Executive Officer and Jane Roach, our Office Manager.  As of September 30, 2016, Mr. Keogh was spending approximately 90% of his time on our business and Jane Roach was spending approximately 100% of her time on our business.  Ben Barton, our Chief Financial Officer, plans to spend approximately 95% of his time on our business.
