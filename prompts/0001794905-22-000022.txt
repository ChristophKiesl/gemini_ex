History and Background
Cyxtera is a global data center leader in retail colocation and interconnection services. Cyxtera’s data center platform consists of 61 highly interconnected data centers across 28 markets on three continents. Cyxtera provides an innovative suite of deeply connected and intelligently automated infrastructure and interconnection solutions to more than 2,300 enterprises, service providers and government agencies around the world.
Cyxtera was incorporated in Delaware as Starboard Value Acquisition Corp. (“SVAC”) on November 14, 2019. On July 29, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), SVAC consummated the business combination pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 21, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among SVAC, Cyxtera Technologies, Inc. (now known as Cyxtera Technologies, LLC), a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Cyxtera”), Mundo Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC (“Merger Sub 1”), Cyxtera Holdings, LLC (formerly known as Mundo Merger Sub 2, LLC), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC (“Merger Sub 2” and, together with Mundo Merger Sub 1, the “Merger Subs”), and Mundo Holdings, Inc. (“NewCo”), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SIS Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership and the sole stockholder of Legacy Cyxtera (“SIS”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Legacy Cyxtera was contributed to NewCo and then converted into a limited liability company and, thereafter, Merger Sub 1 was merged with and into NewCo, with NewCo surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC and immediately following such merger and as part of the same overall transaction NewCo was merged with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2 surviving such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SVAC (the “Business Combination” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, SVAC changed its name to Cyxtera Technologies, Inc. 
Business Overview
We are a global data center leader in retail colocation and interconnection services. We provide an innovative suite of deeply connected and intelligently automated infrastructure and interconnection solutions to more than 2,300 leading enterprises, service providers and government agencies around the world – enabling them to scale faster, meet rising consumer expectations and gain a competitive edge.
We believe that our data center platform sets us apart from our competitors in the data center industry in the following ways:
•Global Footprint: Over 61 facilities in 28 markets, including 10 of the 10 most attractive global markets.
•Breadth of Offering: Complete suite of colocation, connectivity and bare metal solutions.
•World-Class Platform: High-quality assets with dense connectivity and a strong customer ecosystem.
•Market Leadership: Recognized as a leader by customers and industry thought leaders.
•Continuous Innovation: Proven track record of developing innovative products and services.
We focus exclusively on carrier-neutral retail colocation, interconnection and related services, an area we believe represents the sweet spot within the broader data center industry.
We have a large global footprint, which includes key markets in North America, Europe and Asia. This scale and geographic reach enable us to deliver solutions to enterprises, service providers and government agencies in the locations where they want to be – near population centers, customers, employees and service providers – and to support their growth with deployments in multiple data centers across several markets. Our 245 MW of total 
power capacity and 40.7 MW of available expansion capacity is balanced across our platform, positioning us to meet the expanding requirements of our strong customer base.
Our scale and density of our interconnection platform strengthens our customer value proposition. Our interconnection platform includes more than 240 individual network service providers, with an average of 23 per site; low latency connectivity to major public cloud zones from virtually all of our data centers; and approximately 40,000 cross-connects. Our interconnection solutions are the backbone of a global platform of data centers that operate as an ecosystem where our customers can easily connect to other enterprises and business partners, including a wide range of network service providers, public cloud service providers and “as a Service” providers. Utilizing innovative, software-defined and API-driven solutions, we make all of these products easier to consume, allowing customers to deploy, access and manage their IT infrastructure solutions with the click of a button.
We believe we have a stable and predictable business model, with more than 90% of our revenue being recurring revenue, fixed term customer contracts (typically three years), long-tenured customer relationships and network effects that drive customer stickiness.
Our Platform and Competitive Strengths
We believe that our differentiated platform positions us well to compete effectively against other data center providers and capitalize on the secular tailwinds driving rapid industry growth.
Strategic and Centrally Located Data Centers – Our data centers are strategically located in large metropolitan markets globally, which are in close proximity to major business and financial hubs, core clusters of connectivity and a wide range of data center customers, including a diverse collection of global enterprises and leading hyperscale cloud providers. This scale and geographic reach enable us to meet our customers where they want to be and support their growth with deployments in multiple data centers across multiple markets. Furthermore, we believe that the scale and distribution of our data center footprint position us for continued growth and create sustainable barriers to market entry for new entrants and smaller regional players.
High-Quality, Reliable and Secure Facilities – Our portfolio consists of high-quality Tier III data center facilities. A Tier III data center is concurrently maintainable with redundant components as a key differentiator, with redundant distribution paths to serve the critical environment. Tier III data centers provide continuous operations, as their redundant infrastructure allows for equipment maintenance or replacement to be completed without shutting down the facility. Our preventative maintenance program ensures all electrical and mechanical infrastructure is maintained to meet or exceed industry standards. This ensures customers receive the highest levels of availability and has led to 99.999% availability over the last three years.
Attractive and Diversified Customer Base – We have a diversified customer base of over 2,300 customers, consisting primarily of large enterprises and government entities. A majority of our customer base consists of cloud, information technology and network service providers, creating a symbiotic ecosystem with the corporate customers that account for the remainder of our revenue. Only Lumen accounts for more than 5% of our annual revenues (approximately 11% in 2021) and our top 20 customers, other than Lumen, account for approximately 25% of total revenues on a combined basis. Our customers have a long tenure with us, with an average tenure of over 14 years for our top 20 customers (excluding Lumen). The following companies represent some of our customers:
Highly Connected Ecosystem – Our carrier-neutral colocation and interconnection platform consists of approximately 40,000 physical and virtual cross-connects, more than 240 network service providers, more than 1,400 networks and low latency connectivity to major public cloud zones from virtually all of our data centers. We believe that the density of our interconnection platform strengthens our ecosystem, and attracts enterprises, media and content providers, service providers and other groups wanting to access these diverse networks and other enterprises in a single location versus connecting these parties in multiple locations. As of December 31, 2021, our interconnection revenue represented approximately 11% of total revenue.
A Differentiated Platform and Innovative Products – We have a history of, and will continue to invest significantly in, delivering innovative products that make it easier for our customers to consume our data center and related offerings “as a Service”. Our differentiated platform is based on five principles:
•Focus on Innovation – We have developed our Cyxtera Digital Exchange and Enterprise Bare Metal product offerings from the ground up using in-house resources. We maintain a technical research and software development team focused on bringing new innovations to market. We believe this is a competitive advantage that sets us apart from our competitors who have acquired, or do not offer, similar technologies, positioning us to be a leader in using technology to transform the data center and interconnection experience for our customers. Customers want data center providers that can evolve and provide innovative products and services as technology advances, and we believe we have demonstrated this capability.
•Programmability – The Cyxtera Digital Exchange has used an “API-first” approach to offer maximum flexibility, cross-platform versatility and custom solutioning. In addition, by considering API development early on, we built with future functionality in mind, laying the groundwork for an extensible platform.
•“Cloud-Like” Agility – Built on a software-programmable and massively scalable network fabric, our digital exchange offers on-demand provisioning and customization of each element of the traditional data center — including storage, compute, networking, and management — making the data center easier to consume. By providing our customers with the financial and operational flexibility of the cloud alongside the performance and security of enterprise-grade infrastructure, we believe we deliver a solution that maximizes their ability to compete in today’s digital economy.
•Intelligent Automation as a Core Competency – We are passionate about baking automation into every aspect of our business including, for example, by using IoT sensors to share real-time temperature and humidity data and providing customers with tools for automating recurring tasks. Our remote management capabilities deliver an intuitive user experience that brings customers closer to the data center than ever before.
•Seasoned Management Team with Proven Track Record – Our senior management team represents a strong balance of significant experience within the data center industry and related technology and telecommunications industries. This includes the experience of our Chair, who founded and, together with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and other key members of our senior management team, built and successfully ran Terremark Worldwide, Inc. until its sale to Verizon Communications, Inc. in 2011.
Our Growth Strategies
Our objective is to continue growing our position as a leading provider of data center services globally. The key elements of our strategy include:
Increase utilization of in-place data center capacity
As of December 31, 2021, we had a utilization rate of approximately 71% based on square feet of sellable data center capacity (up from 67% as of December 31, 2020). We believe we can leverage our regional sales and partnership strategy to drive capital efficient growth and increase utilization rates of our existing capacity to an industry norm in excess of 80% over time, generating significant revenue growth with high flow-through due to the high operating leverage in our business model.
Drive interconnection penetration and density
We provide more than 2,300 customers with access to over 1,400 networks and facilitate approximately 40,000 cross connects. As data creation and network traffic continue to increase, the powerful network effects present within our ecosystems will result in increased demand for interconnection amongst enterprises and service providers across our global platform. This sticky, recurring revenue and our high contribution margin (95%+) underpin our attractive business model and drive outsized returns on investments. We expect interconnection revenue to grow to 15% of revenue by 2025.
Expand within our existing data center footprint
We have identified several attractive expansion options within existing markets across our footprint. We are currently expanding in our Chicago and Silicon Valley markets and have the ability to further expand in those markets and in London. These expansions, totaling approximately 18 MW of additional sellable power capacity in aggregate, can be executed in a capital efficient manner by expanding existing facilities and leveraging in-market staffing to manage their day-to-day operations. Any such expansion would be success-based, leveraging confirmed customer demand, and would generate substantial high-margin revenue due to the high operating leverage and flow through in our business model.
Enter new markets
Our enterprise customers increasingly prefer to purchase data center services from a small group of partners who can meet their IT requirements on a multi-regional or global scale, and with the efficiency of a single contract structure for their global purchases. We currently operate data centers across all key markets in North America and in key markets in Europe and Asia. We will look to opportunistically expand into new, high-growth markets across Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America to further build out our global platform.
Grow new and existing elements of our innovative product/service portfolio
Since our launch, we have focused on innovative technologies that are intended to improve the customer experience by making it easier for customers to consume our data center services, connect with other customers and service providers and empower their autom0ation initiatives. These innovative technologies include our Enterprise Bare Metal and Digital Exchange (software-defined networking) solutions, among others. We have seen rapid adoption of these offerings by our customers as their requirements continue to evolve.
Strategic M&A and Asset Ownership
We believe we have an opportunity to drive significant incremental growth and value creation through various inorganic growth initiatives, including strategic M&A and increasing our asset ownership. We believe the data center industry remains fragmented and is ripe for further consolidation. We believe that we are well-positioned to be a successful consolidator because of the global scale of our platform, the software systems implemented following the carve-out (which were selected with growth in mind), and the acquisition and integration experience of our team. In addition, we would opportunistically seek to drive additional value creation by acquiring leased assets to increase our ownership base.
Our Product Portfolio
We provide a variety of data center products and services that are specifically designed to address the needs of enterprises, service providers and government agencies. The following are our primary service and product offerings:
Colocation: We provide retail colocation services in 61 high-quality, highly connected data centers in 28 markets across the world. Our colocation services provide customers space and power in our reliable, redundant and secure data centers to host their critical applications and workloads in an integrated ecosystem. Colocation space and power services are offered under fixed duration contracts (typically three years) and billed on a monthly basis generating monthly recurring revenue.
Interconnection: Our carrier- and cloud-neutral, densely connected global data center footprint and thriving partner ecosystem deliver the local, global and cloud connectivity options customers need for today’s distributed hybrid IT. We offer traditional physical cross connects as well as virtual cross connects that can be provisioned on-demand through the Cyxtera Digital Exchange. These offerings provide customers the ability to establish fast, convenient, affordable and highly reliable connections to their preferred network service providers, low latency public cloud on-ramps and a wide range of technology and network service providers and business partners. Interconnection services are offered on month-to-month contract terms and generate monthly recurring revenue.
Bare Metal: Cyxtera Enterprise Bare Metal is an on-demand IT infrastructure solution that allows customers to consume our data center services in a cloud-like fashion by enabling customers to purchase compute solutions “as a Service”. Our fully automated provisioning platform enables customers to seamlessly connect to partner services, including single-tenant, private bare metal servers from NVIDIA, Nutanix, Fujitsu and HPE. Enterprise Bare Metal offers the best of all worlds – rapid access to high-performance compute power to solve for even the most bandwidth-intensive AI and ML workloads, the ability to rapidly scale up and down in accordance with business requirements and the financial benefits associated with having a predictable monthly operating expense rather than a large, upfront capital purchase. Enterprise Bare Metal services are offered under fixed duration contracts and billed on a monthly basis generating monthly recurring revenue.
Cyxtera SmartCabs: In late 2021, Cyxtera launched SmartCabs. SmartCabs are on-demand, dedicated colocation cabinets, complete with built-in power and integrated, configurable, core network fabric. SmartCabs allows customers to instantly deploy and dynamically configure their end-to-end colocation infrastructure in a cloud-like, on-demand model with direct access to a robust ecosystem of technology and service providers available across Cyxtera’s global platform. Integrated with Cyxtera’s massively scalable and highly secure network fabric and offering access to network connectivity from Cyxtera’s on-demand Layer 3 bandwidth solution, IP Connect, 
SmartCabs enable customers to achieve rapid connectivity in an as-a-service model without requiring them to bring in additional network hardware or incur further capital expenditures to get started. Cyxtera expects SmartCabs to be available in 10 markets by the end of this year.
Deployment Services: We offer a variety of value-added services to help customers streamline data center deployment and reduce time-to-solution. These services are provided by our team of industry-recognized personnel and include custom data center installation and set-up, access to secure cages and cabinets, integrated structured cabling solutions including cage design, rack layout and rack elevation and the ability to deliver a turnkey environment. Deployment services are one-time in nature and generally billed at the time of completion or delivery.
Gold Support: Through our gold support services, our infrastructure professionals are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist customers with routine management of their environments such as server reboots, telecommunications support, equipment racking and stacking, operating system loading and magnetic tape backups of critical data. Gold support services can be consumed on an ad hoc basis or in pre-paid blocks, in each case generating non-recurring revenue. Customers can also elect to purchase recurring monthly blocks of gold support hours, generating monthly recurring revenue. 
Competition 
We compete with numerous providers of data center and interconnection services. Many of these companies own or operate data centers similar to ours in the same markets in which our data centers are located. Certain of our data center competitors include Digital Realty Trust, Inc., Equinix, Inc. and Switch, Inc. as well as several privately held data center services providers. We believe that we are differentiated from most competitors in the retail data center industry because we offer a true platform with the large scale and geographic reach of our data center portfolio, density of our interconnection platform – which creates an ecosystem where our customers can easily connect to other enterprises and business partners – and innovative, software-defined technologies that increase the value proposition for customers by making it easier for them to address their hybrid IT infrastructure needs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.”
Customers
Our customers include network service providers, cloud and IT services providers, digital media and content providers, financial services companies and global enterprise ecosystem in various industries. We have more than 2,300 customers, and Lumen accounted for 11% of the total revenues as of December 31, 2021. We provide each customer access to a choice of highly customized solutions based on their scale, colocation and interconnection needs. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on trademarks, domain names, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, contractual provisions and restrictions on access and use to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These include: trademark registrations and applications for “Cyxtera” and the Cyxtera logo; pending patent applications covering various technologies related to our Cyxtera Digital Exchange offering; and various domain name registrations, including for “cyxtera.com.”
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 745 employees worldwide, with 659 based in the United States and Canada, 60 based in Europe, and 26 based in Asia-Pacific. Of those employees, 379 were in engineering and 
operations, 147 were in sales and marketing, and 219 were in management, finance and administration. In addition, of the 745 employees, 744 were full-time employees.
Commitment to Diversity
We have made a commitment to diversity and inclusion in the workplace, one where everyone has the opportunity to fully participate and is valued for their distinctive skills, experiences and perspectives. We make all recruiting, payment, performance and promotion decisions based on merit, without discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, age, family status, ethnic origin, nationality, disability or religious belief.
Employee Development and Recognition
We have invested in resources and opportunities to allow our team members to develop and enhance their skills, including through Cyxtera University, our on-demand learning channel that allows employees to access homegrown and third-party learning tools and content. We seek to proactively recognize employees who are performing at a high level, including through quarterly “Spotlight Awards” that provide for cash bonuses and recognition on our quarterly all-employee town hall meetings.
In early 2022, we launched the Cyxtera Leadership Development Program, a strategic initiative designed to identify and develop the next generation of our company leadership. Participants, who range from Vice Presidents to individual contributors, were selected based on their current outstanding performance, overall skill set and leadership potential. The goal of the program is to work with each selected employee to assess their current leadership skills and identify areas of focus and improvement to enable and empower their future career path.
Employee Health and Safety
We are dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our team members, customers, partners and suppliers. To that end, our dedicated global health and safety function ensures that employees are trained on best practices to create a safe and healthy workplace for all. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of additional precautionary measures as necessary or advisable to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers all while providing a consistent level of service to our customers. In addition, we shifted to a “work from home” policy for all personnel other than data center operations personnel, providing all employees with annual and monthly stipends to support their work from home requirements. 
Employee Engagement and Satisfaction
We conduct periodic employee surveys as a means to receive feedback from our team members and improve employee engagement and satisfaction. We intend to conduct such surveys on at least an annual basis.
Sustainability
We are committed to protecting, connecting and powering a more sustainable digital world and to greening our customers’ supply chains. Through our sustainability efforts, Cyxtera strives to protect our planet and climate, unleash our people’s potential to be a force for good and lead with purpose and integrity in everything we do. Our definition of business growth and success includes steadfastly adhering to best-in-class environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices.
Environmental Matters
We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and could affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Risk Factors
—Risks Related to Environmental Laws and Climate Change Impacts—Environmental regulations may impose new or unexpected costs on us.”
Insurance
We carry comprehensive general liability, property, earthquake, flood and business interruption insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio. We also carry coverage for technology professional liability and cybersecurity. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. In the opinion of our management, we maintain adequate insurance with limits and coverages we believe to be commercially reasonable. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots and war, because such coverage is not available or is not available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, although we carry earthquake and flood insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable, such policies are subject to limitations in certain flood and seismically active zones. Certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—The level of insurance coverage that we purchases may prove to be inadequate.”
