General
 
Flexsteel Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) was incorporated in 1929 and is one of the oldest and largest manufacturer, importer and marketer of residential and contract upholstered and wood furniture products in the United States. Product offerings include a wide variety of upholstered and wood furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, reclining and rocker-reclining chairs, swivel rockers, sofa beds, convertible bedding units, occasional tables, desks, dining tables and chairs and bedroom furniture. The Company’s products are intended for use in home, office, hotel, healthcare and other contract applications. A featured component in most of the upholstered furniture is a unique steel drop-in seat spring from which our name “Flexsteel” is derived. The Company distributes its products throughout the United States through the Company’s sales force and various independent representatives.
 
The Company operates in one reportable segment, furniture products. Our furniture products business involves the distribution of manufactured and imported products consisting of a broad line of upholstered and wooden furniture for residential and contract markets.

Manufacturing and Offshore Sourcing
 
We operate manufacturing facilities that are located in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi and Juarez, Mexico. These manufacturing operations are integral to our product offerings and distribution strategy by offering smaller and more frequent product runs of a wider product selection. We identify and eliminate manufacturing inefficiencies and adjust manufacturing schedules on a daily basis to meet customer requirements. We have established relationships with key suppliers to ensure prompt delivery of quality component parts. Our production includes the use of selected component parts sourced offshore to enhance our value in the marketplace.
 
We integrate our manufactured products with finished products acquired from offshore suppliers who can meet our quality specification and scheduling requirements. We will continue to pursue and refine this blended strategy, offering customers manufactured goods, products manufactured utilizing imported component parts, and ready-to-deliver imported products. This blended focus on products allows the Company to provide a wide range of price points, styles and product categories to satisfy customer requirements.

Competition 
 
The furniture industry is highly competitive and includes a large number of U.S. and foreign manufacturers and distributors, none of which dominates the market. The markets in which we compete include a large number of relatively small manufacturers; however, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes than the Company. Our products compete based on style, quality, price, delivery, service and durability. We believe that our steel seat spring, manufacturing and sourcing capabilities, facility locations, commitment to customers, product quality, delivery, service, value and experienced production, sales, marketing and management teams, are some of our competitive advantages.

The Company’s business is not considered seasonal.

It is not common in the furniture industry to obtain a patent for a furniture design. If a particular design of a furniture manufacturer is well accepted in the marketplace, it is common for other manufacturers to imitate the same design without recourse by the furniture manufacturer who initially introduced the design. Furniture products are designed by the Company’s own design staff and through the services of third-party designers. New models and designs of furniture, as well as new fabrics, are introduced continuously. In the last three fiscal years, these design activities involved the following expenditures (in thousands):
