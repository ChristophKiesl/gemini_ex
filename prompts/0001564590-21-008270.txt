Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating best-in-class cancer therapies. Our initial focus has been on well-characterized biological pathways with significant scientific data supporting their importance. We have built a robust and highly efficient drug discovery capability to create highly differentiated small molecules, which we have the ability to develop in combinations with our monoclonal antibodies through rationally designed, indication-specific trial designs. Our vision is to create, develop and commercialize highly differentiated combination cancer therapies.
Our Clinical Development Pipeline
 The following chart summarizes our clinical pipeline. In 2020, we entered into an Option, License and Collaboration Agreement (Gilead Collaboration Agreement) with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), whereby Gilead obtained an exclusive license to zimberelimab and a time-limited exclusive option to all of our current and future programs during the 10-year collaboration term. For each program to which Gilead exercises their option, the parties will co-develop globally and co-commercialize the program in the U.S., subject to certain exceptions, and Gilead will have the right to commercialize the program outside of the United States, subject to the rights of our existing partners to certain territories. In 2017, we entered into an Option and License Agreement (Taiho Agreement) with Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Taiho) pursuant to which Taiho has a time-limited option to exclusively license the development and commercialization rights to each of our programs for Japan and certain other territories in Asia (excluding China). To date, Taiho has exercised their option rights to our adenosine receptor antagonist program (including etrumadenant) and our anti-PD-1 program (including zimberelimab).

We currently have four clinical-stage investigational products:

 
• | Domvanalimab (previously referred to as AB154) is our anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibody designed to promote sustained immune activation and tumor clearance in combination with other immunotherapy and anti-cancer agents. TIGIT-mediated signaling is known to suppress an array of anti-cancer immune cells. Domvanalimab blocks TIGIT with sub-nanomolar affinity and, in a Phase 1 trial, demonstrated complete receptor coverage on all TIGIT-expressing peripheral leukocytes at the dose-levels tested. In our Phase 1 trial, domvanalimab exhibited a favorable safety profile and demonstrated clinical activity consistent with what has been shown for other anti-TIGIT antibodies in early-stage trials. We are currently evaluating domvanalimab in combination with zimberelimab with or without etrumadenant vs. zimberelimab monotherapy in ARC-7, our randomized Phase 2 trial in first-line metastatic, PD-L1≥50%

non-small cell lung cancer. In February 2021, we initiated ARC-10, our first registrational trial, which will evaluate domvanalimab in combination with zimberelimab and zimberelimab monotherapy vs. chemotherapy in this same setting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Etrumadenant (previously referred to as AB928), the first dual A2a/A2b adenosine receptor antagonist to enter the clinic, is designed to maximally inhibit the adenosine-driven impairment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (mainly T cells and NK cells) and myeloid cells (dendritic cells, macrophages), mediated by the A2a and A2b receptors, respectively. A2b is also upregulated in certain tumors, such as in KRAS-mutated cancers. As a result, etrumadenant may uniquely block adenosine’s immunosuppressive and cancer cell-intrinsic effects. Developed specifically for the oncology setting, etrumadenant achieves high penetration of tumor tissue, robust potency in the presence of high adenosine concentrations, and minimal shift in potency from non-specific plasma protein binding. Etrumadenant has demonstrated a favorable safety profile with a variety of combination regimens and exhibits pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics consistent with once-daily dosing. Etrumadenant is currently being evaluated by us in several randomized or Phase 2 trials across major tumor types, including in our ARC-4, ARC-6, ARC-7, and ARC-9 studies, as well as in two randomized Phase 1b/2 trials being conducted by Genentech (the Morpheus trials).

• | AB680 is an extremely potent and selective small-molecule CD73 inhibitor designed to provide differential benefits relative to monoclonal antibodies, such as greater inhibition of CD73 enzymatic activity (both soluble and cell-bound) and deeper tumor penetration. CD73 is the primary enzymatic producer of immunosuppressive adenosine in the tumor microenvironment; high CD73 expression is associated with significantly poorer prognosis in several tumor types. By effectively eliminating CD73-derived adenosine, AB680 may improve the efficacy of treatment approaches proven to elicit anti-cancer immune responses (e.g., with anti-PD1 and/or platinum-based chemotherapy). AB680 was the first small-molecule CD73 inhibitor to enter the clinic and demonstrated a favorable safety profile with a long half-life in a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers. We are currently evaluating AB680 in a Phase 1/1b study for first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer (ARC-8) as well as in a Phase 2 study in combination with etrumadenant for late-line metastatic prostate cancer (ARC-6).

• | Zimberelimab (previously referred to as AB122) is our anti-PD-1 antibody that we in-licensed to enable the development of our combination regimens. The in-licensed rights include commercialization rights in all countries worldwide other than greater China and Thailand. Guangzhou Gloria Biosciences Co. (Gloria Biosciences), which holds commercialization rights to the same molecule in China, has filed a New Drug Application (NDA) that was accepted for review by China’s National Medicinal Products Association in early 2020 for classical relapsed/refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma. To date, zimberelimab, either alone or in combination with other agents, has been evaluated by us in over 200 patients. We are currently evaluating zimberelimab in combination with other agents across several tumor types, including as discussed above under “Domvanalimab” in our ARC-7 trial and recently initiated ARC-10 registrational trial which is designed to support the approval of zimberelimab. In 2019, Taiho exercised its option right to zimberelimab and in 2020, as part of our Gilead Collaboration Agreement, Gilead obtained an exclusive license to zimberelimab. We retain rights to co-develop zimberelimab with Gilead globally and to co-commercialize with Gilead in the U.S.

We conduct our clinical trials in the U.S. and internationally in geographic regions that are impacted by COVID-19 to varying degrees. While we have seen relatively robust enrollment across our ongoing Arcus-sponsored studies, we expect to see volatility as local governments respond to resurgences and the emergence of new strains, each of which may result in the prolonged reinstitution, extension or enhancement of shelter-in-place measures. The American Cancer Society has also reported that the pandemic has led to declines in screening, diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients, which will impact the enrollment of patients in clinical trials targeting early stage cancers and retention of patients overall in our trials. Patient safety remains our paramount concern and we continue to collaborate with our existing and with new investigational sites to implement measures to minimize disruptions to patients and ensure continued access to treatment, in accordance with health authority guidance. We are unable to predict the full impact of this pandemic on our clinical programs.

Our Strategy 
 Our overarching vision is to create a broad portfolio of best-in-class oncology therapeutics and develop combinations that bring transformative clinical benefits over current treatment options. Our clinical development approach aims to generate meaningful data in the most efficient manner possible in order to rapidly advance our investigational products through clinical trials. Some of the key elements of our strategy include:

• | Building a differentiated portfolio by focusing on intra-portfolio combinations. We are building a diverse portfolio of small-molecule investigational products that target different immune mechanisms, as well as cell-intrinsic pathways important for cancer growth and metastasis. In addition to small molecules, we are also developing antibody investigational products that target what we believe are some of the most important immune checkpoint receptors, including PD-1 and TIGIT, and that we expect to be critical components of our intra-portfolio combinations. By combining these antibody candidates with our internally discovered small-molecule investigational products, we believe we can create highly differentiated combination products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Designing our clinical trials to advance our compounds as quickly and efficiently as possible. We have designed our combination trials to enable faster and higher confidence decision making compared to conventional clinical trial approaches. Our platform trial designs, such as our ARC-6 and ARC-9 studies, allow us to evaluate multiple combinations and settings for a single tumor type in one clinical trial, and compare those combinations against standard-of-care control arms. Our goal is to identify the best combinations and settings and to generate randomized proof-of-concept data for our investigational products early in their development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing combinations and tumor types based on strong biological rationales. In selecting tumor types to pursue, we are focusing on those that are most dependent on the pathways targeted by our agents, such as tumors with high levels of CD73 expression for ATP-adenosine inhibitors. We are also focusing on patient populations and settings in which we believe there is still considerable unmet need. As an example, several tumor types, such as pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, have a high percentage of cases that are driven by certain oncogenic mutations (eg, KRAS mutations) which are associated with poor responses to current available therapies and poor overall survival. Emerging data have also demonstrated that many of these oncogenic driver mutations (eg, KRAS, EGFR, BRAF) are associated with high expression levels of CD73 and the adenosine A2b receptor, uniquely positioning us to target multiple associated pathways with our portfolio of investigational ATP-adenosine targeting agents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focusing on ubiquitously important targets. We largely focus on targets that are ubiquitous, meaning that they are believed to play an important role in a broad range of human cancer types and settings. For example, CD73, the key enzyme responsible for the generation of extracellular adenosine, has been found to be over-expressed in many tumor types, including but not limited to non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastroesophageal cancer, suggesting that it plays a broad immuno-protective role in tumor survival. We believe that our focus on targets and pathways that are ubiquitously involved in cancer will enable our investigational products to address broad patient populations and significant market opportunities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximizing the value of our portfolio through strategic collaborations. We seek to establish collaborative relationships that will provide us with access to capital, opportunities and/or expertise. In 2017, we entered into the Taiho Agreement to secure a development and, if approved, commercialization partner for Japan and certain other Asian countries. In 2020, we established a partnership with Gilead that provided us with an upfront cash payment and equity investment totaling $375 million and provides us with up to $400 million in additional research and development funding during the 10-year collaboration term. Furthermore, for each program that Gilead exercises its option to, we will receive a substantial option payment and Gilead will share 50% of the global costs for that program, while preserving for us the option to co-promote our investigational products in the U.S., should they be approved. We intend to continue to establish strategic collaborations, such as our clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca to evaluate domvanalimab in combination with durvalumab in a registrational phase 3 clinical trial in patients with unresectable Stage 3 NSCLC, so that we can bring our investigational products to the broadest patient population possible.

Our Product Portfolio 
 Domvanalimab, our Anti-TIGIT Antibody
 Because of our early belief that anti-TIGIT antibodies have the potential to become the next backbone immunotherapy, we in-licensed domvanalimab in 2016 and are rapidly advancing this molecule through clinical development. We believe that domvanalimab will be the second or third anti-TIGIT antibody to enter into registrational trials.
 TIGIT is now widely believed to play an important role in suppressing the immune response to cancer. The primary ligand for TIGIT (T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains) is CD155, a protein that plays both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in regulating the activity of effector immune cells such as T and NK cells. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor highly expressed on T cells displaying an exhausted phenotype, tumor-infiltrating Treg, and NK cells. The ligands for TIGIT are broadly expressed on multiple cell types in the tumor micro-environment, including cancer cells, immune cells such as dendritic cells, and stromal cells such as endothelial cells. CD155 binding to TIGIT results in inhibition of immune cells. 
 In addition to TIGIT, CD155 binds, with lower affinity, to DNAM-1 (also known as CD226), a stimulatory receptor also expressed on T cells and NK cells. As a result, when anti-TIGIT antibodies bind to TIGIT, thereby blocking the TIGIT:CD155 interaction, they not only block an inhibitory signal on T cells and NK cells but also free up CD155 to bind to and activate DNAM-1, leading to increased activation of T cells and NK cells. 
 In our Phase 1 dose-escalation study for domvanalimab, we demonstrated the ability to have complete target coverage at very low doses. We have established intravenous dose schedules (every 2 or 3 weeks) and continue to evaluate additional doses and dose schedules in this Phase 1 study. 
 Our ongoing ARC-7 study is a randomized Phase 2 study evaluating the combination of domvanalimab and zimberelimab, with or without etrumadenant, versus zimberelimab monotherapy in first-line PD-L1≥50% NSCLC. We initiated this study in 2020 based on our strong belief that anti-TIGIT antibodies can build upon the efficacy of monotherapy anti-PD-(L)1 treatment in this patient population. We expect to conduct an interim analysis for this study in the second quarter of 2021. 
 We have initiated our first registrational trial for domvanalimab, ARC-10, which will evaluate domvanalimab in combination with zimberelimab versus zimberelimab monotherapy versus chemotherapy in the same patient population as ARC-7. This trial has been designed to support potential regulatory filings for both domvanalimab and zimberelimab combination therapy and zimberelimab monotherapy. In addition, we have entered into a clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca to evaluate domvanalimab in combination with durvalumab in PACIFIC-8, a registrational trial in Stage 3 NSCLC, a setting where durvalumab is already approved. We are also evaluating additional registrational trial opportunities for domvanalimab in combination with other therapies in various tumor types.
 There has been significantly increased activity from competitors evaluating anti-TIGIT combination therapies across multiple tumor types, including recently announced randomized, potentially pivotal, trials in lung cancer and other indications. Notably, at ASCO 2020, Roche presented data from its Phase 2 CITYSCAPE study which demonstrated that tiragolumab, its anti-TIGIT antibody, in combination with atezolizumab demonstrated a 66% overall response rate (ORR) in a subset of patients with high levels of PD-L1 compared to 24% for atezolizumab alone. Because of our early start in the development of domvanalimab and our aggressive clinical development plans, we believe that we are well positioned to establish ourselves as one of the leaders in the anti-TIGIT antibody field.
 Etrumadenant, our Dual A2a/A2b Adenosine Receptor Antagonist 
 Etrumadenant is a small molecule targeting the ATP-adenosine pathway. Under conditions of cellular damage or cell death, such as in response to certain chemotherapies, large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are released into the extracellular environment, where it is converted into adenosine monophosphate by the enzyme CD39 and then into adenosine by the enzyme CD73. However, the generation of large amounts of extracellular adenosine results in an immunosuppressive response that counteracts some of the potentially beneficial effects of chemotherapy. 
 Etrumadenant, which is an orally bioavailable, highly potent and reversible antagonist of the adenosine A2a and A2b receptors, is unlike most other clinical-stage adenosine receptor antagonists, which only target one of the two receptors. We believe that activation of the A2a receptors on T cells and NK cells mediates a significant portion of 
 8


the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine but that binding of adenosine to A2b receptors on myeloid cells also contributes significantly to intra-tumoral immune suppression; consequently, etrumadenant could prove to have more robust anti-tumor effects and activity in a broader range of tumor types than other A2a or A2b antagonists in clinical development. 
 We have evaluated etrumadenant in four Phase 1/1b studies (ARC-2, ARC-3, ARC-4 and ARC-5) across multiple tumor types and with different combination therapies, including with zimberelimab and standard-of-care chemotherapies. In all these studies, etrumadenant demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and 150 mg was established as the recommended daily dose of etrumadenant across all combinations evaluated. These studies further included expansion cohorts to evaluate etrumadenant in the following tumor types: advanced colorectal cancer, triple negative breast cancer, EGFR-mutated lung cancer and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Based on the results from the expansion cohorts, we have designed the following randomized trials to compare etrumadenant combinations against active comparators:
  
• | ARC-6, our platform trial in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC):
--+------------------------------------------------------


o | Etrumadenant + zimberelimab + enzalutamide vs. enzalutamide in 1L mCRPC
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Etrumadenant + zimberelimab + docetaxel vs. docetaxel in 2L+ mCRPC
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Etrumadenant ± zimberelimab ± AB680 in 3L+ mCRPC
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Since adenosine can be produced from various sources besides CD73 in different tumor types, such as prostatic acid phosphatase in prostate cancer, it is possible that inhibiting the adenosine pathway through multiple mechanisms may be needed in certain cancers like prostate cancer.
  
• | ARC-9, our platform trial in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Etrumadenant + zimberelimab + FOLFOX ± bevacizumab vs. FOLFOX ± bevacizumab (2nd line) or regorafenib (3rd line)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Etrumadenant + zimberelimab ± AB680 in 3L+ mCRC
--+------------------------------------------------


• | ARC-4, which is evaluating etrumadenant + zimberelimab + chemotherapy vs. zimberelimab + chemotherapy in EGFRmut NSCLC patients that have failed 1 or 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor-therapies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ARC-7, which includes an arm evaluating etrumadenant in combination with domvanalimab and zimberelimab. In this trial, patients that progress after zimberelimab monotherapy can cross over into the etrumadenant-containing arm to assess whether etrumadenant in combination with domvanalimab and zimberelimab may provide benefit to patients who have failed anti-PD-1 antibody therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Genentech whereby they are evaluating etrumadenant in two of their ongoing Phase 1b/2 MORPHEUS platform studies: 
  
• | Etrumadenant plus atezolizumab and regorafenib vs. atezolizumab and regorafenib vs. regorafenib monotherapy in third-line metastatic colorectal cancer; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Etrumadenant plus atezolizumab and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel vs. gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All these studies support our overall strategy of generating meaningful, randomized data on our investigational products in the fastest and most efficient manner possible.
 AB680, our CD73 Inhibitor 
 AB680 targets the ATP-adenosine pathway, specifically the CD73 enzyme, which plays a critical role in the last step of the process of extracellular ATP conversion into adenosine. CD73 inhibition should therefore be a highly effective approach to inhibiting adenosine-mediated immune suppression, as it could significantly suppress adenosine generation. 
 9


We believe AB680 was the first small-molecule CD73 inhibitor to enter clinical development. While there are several anti-CD73 antibodies in development, we believe that a small-molecule approach to CD73 inhibition could offer several advantages, including: 
  
• | More complete inhibition of CD73 enzymatic activity. We have shown in our assays that our small-molecule CD73 inhibitor, AB680, inhibits CD73 more potently (single-digit picomolar) and effectively than several of the anti-CD73 antibodies in clinical development, including oleclumab (MEDI9447, prepared by Arcus based on Patent Appl. US 2016/0129108). Our small-molecule CD73 inhibitors bind in the active site of the CD73 enzyme and they do so with an affinity about ten million times greater than the affinity of its substrate, AMP, for CD73. In contrast, many anti-CD73 antibodies were not designed to inhibit the enzymatic activity of CD73 but to instead induce internalization of CD73 from the cell surface and therefore will be less effective at inhibiting cell-bound and soluble forms of CD73. There are significant levels of soluble CD73 that have been shed from the cell surface. Our small-molecule inhibitors display comparable potency and effectiveness against soluble as well as membrane-bound forms of CD73.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deeper tumor penetration. Based on preclinical work, we expect that our small-molecule CD73 inhibitors should be able to achieve better penetration of tumor tissue relative to the CD73 antibodies which are much larger molecules. It is well accepted that monoclonal antibodies, because of their molecular size and properties, cannot diffuse further than a few microns from the blood vessel that delivers them to the tumor.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for both intravenous and oral delivery. We are developing both oral and intravenous formulations of AB680, which could provide flexibility on dosing regimens and be attractive commercially. The intravenous formulation of AB680 is dosed once every two weeks, which would be convenient for patients also undergoing infusions with an anti-PD-1 antibody or a chemotherapy regimen. An orally formulated AB680 would be convenient for patients not undergoing regular infusions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In our initial study of AB680 in healthy volunteers, AB680 was well tolerated in single and multi-day administration and demonstrated a half-life consistent with dosing every two weeks. At the highest doses tested, AB680 also achieved significant inhibition of CD73 activity following a single dose.
 We are currently evaluating AB680 in ARC-8, our Phase 1/1b clinical study in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (NP/Gem), standard-of-care chemotherapies used for advanced pancreatic cancer, and zimberelimab. We selected pancreatic cancer as the initial indication to pursue for AB680 given its high level of CD73 expression and the anticipated immunogenicity of the chemotherapy. 
 We presented initial results from the 25mg, 50mg, 75mg and 100mg (all dosed every two weeks) cohorts from the dose-escalation portion of ARC-8 at the ASCO 2021 Virtual Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO GI) in January 2021. These results demonstrated encouraging safety and clinical data:
  
• | No significant additive toxicity from AB680 plus NP/Gem was observed beyond that expected from NP/Gem alone.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Only one dose limiting toxicity in 19 evaluable patients was observed (Grade 2 autoimmune hepatitis), which resolved with steroid treatment and the patient was able to resume treatment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 17 efficacy-evaluable patients, a 41% (7/17) objective response rate (ORR) was observed. Of the partial responses, three were confirmed as of the presentation’s data cut-off date; of the four unconfirmed responders, three responded at the first tumor assessment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For patients that had been on drug for more than 16 weeks, an 85% (11/13) disease control rate (DCR) was achieved with the AB680 combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The last drug to be approved in the first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer setting was Abraxane® (nab-paclitaxel) in combination with gemcitabine, which demonstrated a 23% ORR and 48% DCR in its Phase 3 registrational study.
 Based on these results, we opened the dose-expansion portion of this trial using an AB680 dose of 100mg every two weeks and expect to open a control arm in this study shortly. Given the lack of significant additive toxicity from AB680, we are also exploring a 125mg dose of AB680 in the dose-escalation portion. Additionally, we have opened 
 10


arms to evaluate AB680 in combination with etrumadenant with and without zimberelimab in our ARC-6 and ARC-9 studies and plan to explore AB680 in other tumor types and settings that we believe are associated with high levels of adenosine.    
 Zimberelimab, our Anti-PD-1 Antibody 
 In 2017, we in-licensed zimberelimab from WuXi Biologics. Zimberelimab is a fully human IgG4 antibody that was discovered by WuXi Biologics using the transgenic rat platform from Open Monoclonal Technology. The biochemical, biological and preclinical properties of zimberelimab have been shown by WuXi Biologics and us to be comparable to those of the marketed anti-PD-1 antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab.
 We are currently using zimberelimab as the cornerstone of our combination strategy and it is being evaluated in combination with our other molecules in all of our ongoing clinical studies. Our registrational ARC-10 study includes a zimberelimab monotherapy arm and is designed to support the potential approval of zimberelimab as monotherapy.  
 In 2019, Taiho exercised its option to obtain development and commercialization rights to zimberelimab for Japan and certain other territories in Asia (excluding China). In 2020, Gilead received rights to zimberelimab as part of our partnership agreement with them. Together, we and Gilead will co-develop zimberelimab globally and co-commercialize zimberelimab in the U.S. Gilead has the right to commercialize zimberelimab outside the United States, subject to Taiho’s existing commercialization rights and Gloria Biosciences’s commercialization rights in China. 
 Our Early-Stage Drug Discovery Programs 
 We have active early stage discovery efforts focused on the creation of additional development candidates aimed at regulating various aspects of the anti-tumor immune response as well as other cancer-intrinsic pathways which we believe play an important role in many human cancers. These include AB308, our FcR-enabled anti-TIGIT antibody, which received IND clearance in January 2021 and is expected to enter a clinical trial shortly, as well as several small molecules aimed at modulating key biological pathways in various types of cancer that are responsible for the abnormal growth and resistance to current therapies. The targets for these programs include HIF-2a, PAK4, and Axl. We anticipate selecting small molecule development candidates and initiating CMC/preclinical development for at least two of these new programs, followed by initiation of clinical development for at least one of them in 2021.
 In addition, in December 2020, we announced a collaboration to discover anti-CD39 antibodies with WuXi Biologics. CD39 represents another key node along the ATP-adenosine pathway and rounds out our portfolio of ATP-adenosine targeting molecules.
 Commercialization Plans
 Subject to timely exercise of their respective option rights, the Taiho Agreement provides us with a potential commercialization partner for Japan and certain other Asian countries, and the Gilead Collaboration Agreement provides us with a potential commercialization partner for the rest of the world. Under our Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we retain co-promotion rights for the U.S. Therefore, we intend to build the necessary infrastructure and sales, marketing and commercial product distribution capabilities to co-promote our products, if approved, for the United States. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, and the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
License and Collaboration Agreements
 Gilead Agreements 
 On May 27, 2020, we entered into the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, a Common Stock Purchase Agreement, and an Investor Rights Agreement, (collectively, the Gilead Agreements), each with Gilead. The transactions under these agreements closed on July 13, 2020 following expiration of the antitrust waiting period. Pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, Gilead obtained an exclusive option to acquire an exclusive license to all of our current and future clinical programs during the 10-year collaboration term, contingent upon Gilead’s payment of up to $400.0 million over the collaboration term, and, for those programs that enter clinical development prior 
 11


to the end of the collaboration term, for up to an additional three years thereafter. Gilead may exercise its option, on a program-by-program basis, upon payment of an option fee that ranges from $200 million to $275 million per program for our clinical programs in existence at the date of the agreement, and $150 million per program for all of our other programs that enter clinical development thereafter. If Gilead exercises its option with respect to our TIGIT program, we are also eligible to receive up to $500 million in potential U.S. regulatory approval milestones with respect to domvanalimab. Pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, upon closing, Gilead made a $175 million upfront cash payment and obtained an exclusive license to our zimberelimab program. 
 Upon Gilead’s exercise of its option to a program, the companies will co-develop, equally share global development costs and equally share all profits and losses for the United States, subject to certain opt-out rights for us, expense caps on our spending and true-up adjustments. For each optioned program, provided we have not exercised our opt-out rights, we have an option to co-promote in the United States. Gilead will obtain rights to exclusively commercialize any optioned programs outside of the U.S., subject to the rights of our existing partners to any territories, and Gilead will pay to us tiered royalties as a percentage of revenues ranging from the high teens to the low twenties. 
 The Gilead Collaboration Agreement is subject to termination by either party for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency, and by Gilead with sufficient prior written notice. Other customary termination rights are further provided in the Gilead Collaboration Agreement.
 In addition to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we and Gilead entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement and an Investor Rights Agreement, which we refer to as the Equity Agreements, pursuant to which Gilead made an upfront equity investment of $200 million by purchasing from us 5,963,029 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $33.54 per share. Gilead also has the right, at its option, to purchase additional shares from us, up to a maximum ownership of 35% of our then-outstanding voting common stock, from time to time over the next five years, at a purchase price equal to the greater of a 20% premium to market (based on a trailing five-day average closing price) at the time Gilead exercises such option, and the $33.54 initial purchase price. The Equity Agreements also include a three-year standstill and a two-year lockup and provide Gilead with registration rights commencing at the end of the lockup period, pro rata participation rights in certain future financings and the right to designate two individuals to be appointed to our Board of Directors.
 On January 31, 2021, we and Gilead entered into an Amended and Restated Common Stock Purchase Agreement, which amended and restated in its entirety the Common Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Gilead purchased from us 5,650,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $39.00 per share. All other terms of the original Common Stock Purchase Agreement, including Gilead’s option to purchase additional shares from us, up to a maximum ownership of 35% of our then-outstanding common stock, remain unchanged.
 Taiho Option and License Agreement 
 In 2017, we entered into the Taiho Agreement, pursuant to which Taiho provided $35.0 million of non-refundable, non-creditable cash payments to us during the first three years of the agreement in exchange for an exclusive option, over a five-year period (the Option Period), to in-license the development and commercialization rights to clinical stage investigational products from our portfolio (each, an Arcus Program) for Japan and certain other territories in Asia (excluding China) (the Taiho Territory). As of December 31, 2019, Taiho has paid us the full $35.0 million obligation pursuant to the terms of the agreement. If we do not initiate IND-enabling studies for at least five Arcus Programs prior to the expiration of the Option Period, Taiho may elect to extend the Option Period, up to a maximum of seven years for the Option Period, subject to an extension fee. If Taiho elects to exercise any such options, the license described above will be granted under terms and conditions set forth in the agreement. Under such terms, Taiho is obligated to pay an option exercise payment for each option exercise of between $3.0 million to $15.0 million, with the amount dependent on the development stage of the applicable Arcus Program for which the option is exercised. In addition, Taiho is obligated to pay to us clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones of up to $275.0 million with respect to each program for which Taiho exercises the option and been granted the applicable license, as well as royalties ranging from high single digits to mid-teens, on net sales in Taiho’s territories. Royalties will be payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis during the period of time commencing on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country and ending upon the later of: (i) ten (10) years from the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country; and (ii) expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of our patents covering the manufacture, use or sale or exploitation of such licensed product in such country. 
 12


In July 2018, Taiho exercised its option to our adenosine receptor antagonist program, which includes etrumadenant, and in November 2019, Taiho exercised its option to our anti-PD-1 program, which includes zimberelimab. Upon such exercises, Taiho is responsible for the development and commercialization of licensed products from within the programs in the Taiho Territory.
 This agreement will remain in effect until (i) expiration of the last option exercise period if Taiho has not exercised any of its options or (ii) if Taiho has exercised any of its options, expiry of all royalty terms for the licensed products.
 WuXi Biologics License Agreement 
 Our license agreement (the WuXi PD-1 Agreement) with WuXi Biologics Ireland Limited (successor-in-interest to WuXi Biologics (Cayman) Inc., WuXi Biologics), which we entered into in 2017 as subsequently amended, provides us with an exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, and commercialize products that include an anti-PD-1 antibody, including zimberelimab, throughout the world except for Greater China and Thailand. We have made upfront and milestone payments under the WuXi PD-1 Agreement totaling $31.0 million and incurred sub-license fees of $11.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and we may be required to make additional clinical and regulatory milestone payments, commercialization milestone payments up to $375.0 million, and royalty payments that range from high single-digits to low teens of net sales beginning on the first commercial sale and ending on the later of (i) ten (10) years following such first commercial sale and (ii) the expiry of all patents that may subsequently be issued or granted that cover the product in such country, hereafter referred to as the royalty term. We are also required to pay WuXi Biologics a percentage in the low double digits of certain sublicense income that we receive from our sublicensees in direct connection with our sublicensees’ rights to use WuXi Biologics’s patents, patent applications and know-how. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we made milestone payments of $5.0 million and incurred sub-license fees of $10.1 million under the WuXi PD-1 Agreement, all recorded within research and development expense.
 We are obligated to appoint WuXi Biologics as our exclusive manufacturer of such licensed products for a specified period of time subject to certain exceptions. Our sublicensees, however, may manufacture, at any time, certain portions of their requirements for such product subject to certain conditions. We made certain covenants not to commercialize any anti-PD-1 antibody licensed or obtained by us after the date of the license agreement with WuXi Biologics other than anti-PD-1 antibodies licensed from WuXi Biologics, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the WuXi Agreement. This agreement terminates, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, on expiration of the royalty term for such licensed product for the applicable country. 
 Abmuno License Agreement 
 In 2016, we entered into a license agreement (the Abmuno Agreement) with Abmuno Therapeutics LLC (Abmuno) for a worldwide exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture, and commercialize products that include an anti-TIGIT antibody, including domvanalimab. Under the agreement, we have made upfront and milestone payments totaling $9.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and we may be required to make additional clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments of up to $98.0 million. 
 The Abmuno Agreement terminates on the latest of (i) the expiry of the last-to-expire Abmuno licensed patent that covers a product that contains an anti-TIGIT antibody, (ii) the date on which there is no longer an Abmuno licensed patent application that is still pending and has been pending for a certain period of time that covers a product that contains an anti-TIGIT antibody and (iii) 10 years from the date of first commercial sale. 
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our investigational products for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our investigational products obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational products, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our investigational products. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, our third-party contract manufacturers continue to operate at or near normal levels and, at this time and subject to further COVID-19 
 13


implications, we believe we currently have sufficient drug supply for our ongoing clinical studies and we do not anticipate any disruptions to our drug supply chain.
 To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug product for our investigational products from single-source third party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our investigational products and intend to put in place framework agreements under which third-party contract manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs. With respect to zimberelimab, we agreed, as part of our license agreement with WuXi Biologics, that WuXi Biologics would be our exclusive manufacturer of zimberelimab with respect to clinical and commercial supplies until a certain number of years after marketing approval for zimberelimab, subject to certain exceptions. 
 As we advance our investigational products through development, we will consider our lack of redundant supply for the API and drug product for each of our investigational products to protect against any potential supply disruptions. 
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop. 
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Any investigational products that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies that may become available in the future. 
 We will compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that develop immuno-oncology treatments. There are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer in partnership with Merck KGaA, Regeneron in partnership with Sanofi Genzyme and Roche/Genentech. 
 For our dual adenosine receptor antagonist, etrumadenant, we are aware that Incyte has initiated clinical development of a dual adenosine receptor antagonist and we are aware of clinical-stage selective adenosine A2aR antagonists being developed by other companies, including AstraZeneca, Corvus, CStone, iTeos Therapeutics and Novartis, and a clinical-stage selective adenosine A2bR antagonist being developed by Palobiofarma. To our knowledge, there are no adenosine receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of cancer and the most advanced is in Phase 2 development.
 For our small molecule CD73 inhibitor, AB680, we are aware of several pharmaceutical companies developing antibodies against this target, including Akeso, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Corvus, Novartis, Symphogen and Tracon/I-Mab, all of whom have advanced their CD73 antibodies into clinical development. Other pharmaceutical companies, such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Calithera, Eli Lilly, Merck and ORIC, have small-molecule programs against this target, of which only Eli Lilly has advanced its CD73 inhibitor into clinical development. To our knowledge, there are no approved CD73 inhibitors and the most advanced is in Phase 2 development.
 For our anti-PD-1 antibody, zimberelimab, multiple large pharmaceutical companies have already received regulatory approvals for their anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, including AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer in partnership with Merck KGaA, Regeneron in partnership with Sanofi Genzyme and Roche/Genentech, and there are also many other anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies in clinical development.
 For our anti-TIGIT antibody, domvanalimab, we are aware of several pharmaceutical companies developing antibodies against this target, including Agenus, Beigene, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Compugen, Roche/Genentech, Innovent, iTeos Therapeutics, Merck KGaA, Mereo and Seattle Genetics. To our knowledge, there are no approved anti-TIGIT antibodies and the most advanced agent is in Phase 3 development.
 Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory 
 14


approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These potential competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our investigational products, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics (if required), the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries for our investigational products, to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing, in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, patent applications intended to cover the composition of matter of our investigational products, their methods of use, and related discoveries, technologies, inventions and improvements that may be commercially important to our business. We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We also intend to take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 As of February 1, 2021, we have issued U.S. patents directed to compositions of matter with respect to our adenosine receptor antagonist, CD73 inhibitor and anti-TIGIT antibody programs. As of February 1, 2021, our company-owned and licensed patent portfolio consists of 18 pending or issued U.S. patent applications, 8 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent applications, and approximately 250 pending or issued foreign patent applications directed to compositions of matter, methods of synthesis and methods of use. The term of any patents that issue will vary in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction, but is typically 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued patents and any patents that may issue in the future from our company-owned or licensed pending applications are projected to expire between 2035 and 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our investigational products and enforce the patent rights that we own or license, and could affect the value of such intellectual property. With respect to both company-owned and licensed intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that the patent applications we are currently pursuing or may file in the future will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Our competitors may independently develop similar investigational products or technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. We cannot be sure that any patents granted to us will be commercially useful in protecting our products or their methods of use or manufacture. Moreover, even issued patents do not guarantee us the right to commercialize our products. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing or manufacturing our investigational products.
 Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of an investigational product, it is possible that, before a product can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved product may, in certain cases, be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term 
 15


during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved product. While we intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 Government Regulation
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of therapeutic products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and implementing regulations. These laws and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of therapeutic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending regulatory applications, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
  
• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (GCP), to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submissions to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA) for a new product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the facility or facilities where the investigational product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the investigational product’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA/BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA/BLA.
--+----------------------------------------

 16



Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the investigational product or disease. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific trials or all trials conducted under the IND.
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of an investigational product’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the investigational product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about an investigational product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical trials to support NDAs/BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the investigational product usually into healthy human subjects, the investigational product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the investigational product for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If an investigational product demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the investigational product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the investigational product. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in certain circumstances.
 17


Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the investigational product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the investigational product and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the investigational product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA, for a drug investigational product, or a BLA, for a biological investigational product, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the investigational product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information and the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review investigational products are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA or BLA; most applications for priority review investigational products are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA or BLA. Priority review can be applied to an investigational product that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use, a BLA to determine whether the product is safe, pure, and potent, and in each case, whether the investigational product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel investigational products, or investigational products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the investigational product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the investigational product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To assure GCP and cGMP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditures of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive. The FDA may disagree with our trial design or interpret data from preclinical studies and clinical trials differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biological product in the United States with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 18


Even if an investigational product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Foreign Clinical Trials to Support an IND, NDA, or BLA
 The FDA will accept as support for an IND, NDA, or BLA a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial if it was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an on-site inspection, if necessary. A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical trial to support an IND must submit the following supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the trial conformed to GCP:
  
• | the investigator’s qualifications;
--+-----------------------------------


• | a description of the research facilities;
--+------------------------------------------


• | a detailed summary of the protocol and trial results and, if requested, case records or additional background data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of the drug substance and drug product, including the components, formulation, specifications, and, if available, the bioavailability of the investigational product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | information showing that the trial is adequate and well controlled;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the name and address of the independent ethics committee that reviewed the trial and a statement that the independent ethics committee meets the required definition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | a summary of the independent ethics committee’s decision to approve or modify and approve the trial, or to provide a favorable opinion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how informed consent was obtained;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | a description of what incentives, if any, were provided to subjects to participate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how the sponsor monitored the trial and ensured that the trial was consistent with the protocol;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a description of how investigators were trained to comply with GCP and to conduct the trial in accordance with the trial protocol; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a statement on whether written commitments by investigators to comply with GCP and the protocol were obtained.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Regulatory applications based solely on foreign clinical data meeting these criteria may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the trials have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet any of these criteria may result in the application not being approvable based on the foreign data alone.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing investigational products, or provide for the approval of an investigational product on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if an investigational product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the investigational product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, investigational products that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of investigational products to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give an investigational product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, an initial review within eight months as compared to a standard review time of twelve months.
 Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated investigational product and expedite review of the application for an investigational product designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new investigational product that meets the following criteria: is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of an investigational product receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provides Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of an investigational product as a “breakthrough therapy” if the investigational product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the investigational product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. 
 20


Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application for the therapeutic for that particular disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The FDA may revoke orphan drug designation, and if it does, it will publicize the drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug.
 If an investigational product with orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the investigational product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same investigational product for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our investigational products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same investigational product as defined by the FDA or if our investigational product is determined to be contained within the competitor’s investigational product for the same indication or disease.
 21


Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 After approval, owners of relevant drug or biological product patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the product’s testing phase—the time between IND and NDA or BLA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA or BLA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
 For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the investigational product covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for an investigational product for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. An investigational product is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new investigational product containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the investigational product substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such investigational product where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing investigational product. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for investigational products containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Biosimilars
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological investigational products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological investigational product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials, animal trials, and a clinical trial or trials, unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element. A biosimilar investigational product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic investigational product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) 18 months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first 
 22


interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Any product manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:

• | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | registration and listing requirements; and
--+-------------------------------------------


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Manufacturers, their subcontractors, and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drug and biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP, including data integrity requirements, and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers engaged by us if our products are approved. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizures of products, injunctive actions or other civil penalties. We cannot be certain we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials or require us to recall a product from distribution.
 23


In addition, therapeutic manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate product.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical drug trials (other than Phase 1 trials) are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the investigational product, comparator(s), patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of certain trials may be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of trial-related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could in the future be required to be disclosed. In addition, publication policies of major medical journals mandate certain registration and disclosures as a pre-condition for potential publication, even when this is not presently mandated as a matter of law. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Additional Controls for Biological Products
 To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 After a BLA is approved, the biological product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
 In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biological products, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic and regulated by FDA as a medical device, at the same time that the FDA approves the investigational product. The review of an in vitro companion diagnostic in conjunction with the review of an investigational product involves coordination of review between internal organizations within FDA. Most companion diagnostics require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMAs are subject to a substantial application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the 
 24


FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 After a device is placed on the market following appropriate approval or clearance from the FDA, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (ACA), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (FCA) (discussed below).
 The federal false claims, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or 
 25


approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Certain of our products, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs or biologicals, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.
 In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price (ASP) and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to our products in the 
 26


future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. Medicare reimbursement rates may also reflect budgetary constraints placed on the Medicare program.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act) within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any investigational products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.
 27


Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
  
• | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


• | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

 We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Additionally, our collaborators will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any companion diagnostic tests they develop separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our investigational products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any investigational product that we successfully develop.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular investigational product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any investigational products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 28


Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of investigational products, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell investigational products for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 For example, the ACA has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;

 There remain legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in December 2017, Congress repealed the tax penalty for an individual’s failure to maintain ACA-mandated health insurance that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate” as part of a tax reform bill. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although 
 29


the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
 Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Medicare sequester reductions under the Budget Control Act of 2011 are suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. Further, the Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals. The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of this rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.
 We anticipate that current and future healthcare reform measures could result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from investigational products that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop investigational products. Further, it is possible that additional government action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Other Regulations
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to conduct clinical trials or market a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Australia
 Conducting clinical trials for therapeutic drug candidates in Australia is subject to regulation by Australian regulatory bodies. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the National Health and Medical Research Council set the codes of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) for clinical research in Australia, and compliance with these codes is mandatory. Australia has also adopted international codes, such as those promulgated by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (the ICH). The ICH guidelines must be complied with across all fields of clinical research, including those related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical data requirements and trial designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in-human trial under ICH guidelines are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major jurisdictions.
 Clinical trials conducted using “unapproved therapeutic goods” in Australia, being those which have not yet been evaluated by the TGA for quality, safety and efficacy must occur pursuant to either the Clinical Trial Notification Scheme (CTN Scheme), or the Clinical Trial Exemption Scheme (CTX Scheme). In each case, the trial is supervised by a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) an independent review committee set up under guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council that ensures the protection of rights, safety and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical trial. A HREC does this by reviewing, approving and providing continuing examination of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects.
 31


The CTN Scheme broadly involves:
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to a HREC, of all material relating to the proposed clinical trial, including the trial protocol;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the institution or organization at which the trial will be conducted, referred to as the “Approving Authority”, giving final approval for the conduct of the trial at the site, having regard to the advice from the HREC;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the investigator submitting a ‘Notification of Intent to Conduct a Clinical Trial’ form (the CTN Form) to the TGA. The CTN form must be signed by the sponsor, the principal investigator, the chairman of the HREC and a person responsible from the Approving Authority. The TGA does not review any data relating to the clinical trial however CTN trials cannot commence until the trial has been notified to the TGA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the CTX Scheme:
  
• | a sponsor submits an application to conduct a clinical trial to the TGA for evaluation and comment; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a sponsor must forward any comments made by the TGA Delegate to the HREC(s) at the sites where the trial will be conducted.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A sponsor cannot commence a trial under the CTX Scheme until written advice has been received from the TGA regarding the application and approval for the conduct of the trial has been obtained from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted.
 Approval for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) is required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed (or imported, exported or manufactured) in Australia. In order to obtain registration of the product on the ARTG, it is required that:
  
• | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the therapeutic product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evidence is compiled which demonstrates that the manufacture of the therapeutic product complies with the principles of cGMP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing and clinical data is derived to submit to the Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines, which makes recommendations to the TGA as to whether or not to grant approval to include the therapeutic product in the ARTG; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an ultimate decision is made by the TGA whether to include the therapeutic product in the ARTG.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Europe
 Similar to the United States and Australia, the conduct of clinical trials in the EU are subject to regulatory controls. Under the current EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (Directive), before a clinical trial can be initiated in the EU, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the national Competent Authority and one or more Ethics Committees. In 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 (Regulation) to replace the current Directive, with a three-year transition period. The Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State, who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU database. The Regulation will become directly applicable in all EU Member States once the centralized portal and database for clinical trials are fully functional. 
 The Directive will still apply for three years from the date of application of the Regulation for clinical trial applications submitted before the date of application of the Regulation and for clinical trial applications submitted under the Directive within one year after the date of application of the Regulation.

Commercialization of our investigational products may only occur in the EU following approval of a marketing application, which can be obtained through either a centralized or a decentralized procedure:
  
• | Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. If this committee delivers a favorable opinion, this typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs, and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Under the decentralized procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which a marketing authorization is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (SPC) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national marketing authorization in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will be subject to additional regulations with respect to any activities we conduct in the EU. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to health-related and other personal data of individuals in the European Union. The GPDR, which went into effect in May 2018, imposes more stringent operational requirements on processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is collected, used and shared, limitations on retention of personal data, more stringent requirements pertaining to genetic, biometric and health data, mandatory data breach notification requirements, and higher standards for controllers to demonstrate valid consent for certain data processing activities. The GDPR further provides that European Union Member States may implement their own additional laws and regulations in relation to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could result in differences in the GDPR’s implementation among Member States. The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we must put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules.
 Human Capital Resources
 Our culture and values can be defined by one overarching concept: We do the right things for the right reasons. We take pride in hard work and approach our mission—to create, develop and commercialize highly differentiated combination cancer therapies that have the potential to cure—with a great sense of urgency. We recognize that our employees are a critical component to our success and we strive to attract the best talent from a range of sources, including an internship program through which we have developed strong relationships with multiple universities to foster talent and attract skilled graduates. In 2020, we added 105 new employees to our team and expect more growth in 2021, with a focus on expanding our expertise and capabilities in research, clinical development and across our organization. 
 We recognize that attracting skilled talent is only one part of the equation. We endeavor to retain and motivate our employees by empowering them to make the decisions they are most qualified and best positioned to decide and by providing opportunities for growth and development, such as through our education reimbursement program. We focus on wellness through our CEO-funded lunch program, a quarterly stipend to assist with wellness and commuter expenses, and our coverage of 95% of the costs for healthcare benefits. Since the COVID pandemic, we have increased our focus on safety and wellness. In March 2020, we voluntarily transitioned our employees, including our laboratory-based personnel, to work-from-home prior to the institution of state and local shelter-in-place orders. While we were able to transition our non-laboratory operations to remote work arrangements, this was not possible for our laboratory-based personnel. Despite a shutdown in our laboratory operations into June 2020, we did not institute any furlough or salary reductions. In connection with the resumption of our laboratory operations, we instituted regular COVID-19 testing services in order to minimize the risk to our employees.
 33


As of February 1, 2021, we had 236 full-time employees, 92 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees or R.N. certifications. Of these employees, 184 were engaged in research and development activities and 52 were engaged in general and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
