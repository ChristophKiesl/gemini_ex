   Recent Developments
 
 Business Optimization
 
In April, 2021, we committed to a strategic business optimization plan to eliminate approximately 1,600 SKUs of low-margin, third-party distributed products and streamline physical therapy and rehabilitation product sales exclusively to dealers. Sales of distributed products has been declining and the maintenance of our own direct sales force has been perceived as competing with some of our customers. These actions were taken as part of our efforts to improve gross margins and profitability over the long-term. The elimination of distributed products and our direct sales channel has reduced complexity and associated support costs, while enhancing our focus on the higher margin products we manufacture, and on our customers. The optimization plan was substantially complete as of June 30, 2021. We anticipate that the elimination of our distributed products portfolio will result in an approximate $11 million reduction in annual net sales for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, but that annual gross margin and operating income in fiscal year 2022 will improve relative to fiscal year 2021.

 Total costs associated with these exit activities were $1,001,000 during the year ended June 30, 2021, and consisted of cash charges totaling $158,000 and non-cash charges totaling $843,000. Cash charges included employee severance and retention costs. Non-cash charges included: (1) $488,000 related to excess and obsolete inventory, (2) $255,000 related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, (3) $67,000 related to impairment of property and equipment, and (4) $33,000 related to impairment of intangible assets. Charges associated with excess and obsolete inventory are included in costs of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. All other charges are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidates statements of operations. We do not expect to incur additional charges associated with these exit activities. Accrued severance at June 30, 2021, of $158,000, is expected to be settled within three months. 


Tennessee Building Sale   
 On April 2, 2021, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of our former manufacturing facility building located at 6607 Mountainview Road, Ooltewah, Tennessee for a purchase price of $1,750,000. On May 13, 2021, Dynatronics and Maple Leaf Realco VII, LLC closed the sale, resulting in net proceeds of $1,650,000, for a gain of $812,000.
  Forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program Loan
 
 On April 29, 2020, we entered into a promissory note with Bank of the West to evidence a loan in the amount of $3,477,000 under the paycheck protection program established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration.  On June 29, 2021, we received notification from Bank of the West that the SBA approved the Company's forgiveness application for the entire balance of the promissory note for $3,518,000, including all accrued interest thereon, leaving the Company with a remaining Note balance of zero as of June 30, 2021.

  Our Products
 
 We sell products that we manufacture. Historically, we also sold and distributed products that were manufactured by unrelated third parties. To distinguish between these types of products, in this report we refer to products manufactured by any of our Dynatronics affiliated entities or contract manufacturer as “Manufactured Products”, and we refer to our products that we distributed that were manufactured by third parties as “Distributed Products” . Manufactured Products accounted for approximately 79% of our net sales (excluding freight, repairs, and miscellaneous items) in fiscal year 2021.
 
 We offer a broad range of restorative products for clinical use in physical therapy, rehabilitation, orthopedics, pain management, and athletic training. Our offerings include orthopedic soft bracing products, treatment tables, rehabilitation equipment, therapeutic modalities, and related supplies.

 Patents and Trademarks
 
 Patents. We own a United States patent on our thermoelectric technology that will remain in effect until February 2033. We also hold a United States patent on our combination traction/phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until December 2026, and a United States patent on our phototherapy technology that will remain in effect until August 2025.
   
 Trademarks and Copyrights. We own trademarks used in our business, particularly marks relating to our corporate and product names. United States trademark registrations that are significant to our business include Dynatron®, Dynatron Solaris®, Dynaheat®, BodyIce®, Powermatic®, Bird & Cronin®, Physician’s Choice®, and the Hausmann designed logo.

 Federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the United States, regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs. We may register additional trademarks in countries where our products are or may be sold in the future. Protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection provided by registration under U.S. law. Trademark protection continues in some countries so long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, so long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely. Our print materials are also protected under copyright laws, both in the United States and internationally.
 
 We also claim ownership and protection of certain product names, unregistered trademarks, and service marks under common law. Common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We believe these trademarks, whether registered or claimed under common law, constitute valuable assets, adding to recognition of the Company and the effective marketing of our products.
 
 Trade Secrets. We own certain intellectual property, including trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with key employees and other parties involved in manufacturing, research, and development. Even where these agreements exist, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors.
 
 We intend to protect our legal rights in our intellectual property by all appropriate legal action. Consequently, we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights. Any litigation related to our intellectual property could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel.
 
  Warranty Service
 
 We provide a warranty on all Manufactured Products for time periods generally ranging in length from 90 days to five years from the date of sale. We service warranty claims on these products at our Utah, New Jersey and Minnesota sites depending on the product and service required. Our warranty policies are comparable to warranties generally available in the industry. Warranty claims are not material.
 
 Distributed Products carry warranties provided by the various manufacturers of those products. We do not generally supplement these warranties or provide unreimbursed warranty services for Distributed Products. We also sell accessory items for our Manufactured Products that are supplied by other manufacturers. These accessory products carry warranties from their original manufacturers without supplement from us.
 
  Customers and Markets
 
 We sell products to licensed practitioners such as orthopedists, physical therapists, chiropractors, and athletic trainers. Our customers also include professional sports teams and universities, sports medicine specialists, post-acute care facilities, hospitals, clinics, retail distributors and equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners. We utilize a network of over 300 independent dealers throughout the United States. Most dealers purchase and take title to the products, which they then sell to end users. In addition, we utilize a network of independent sales representatives combined with a small number of targeted direct sales representatives.
 
 We have entered into agreements with independent clinics and hospitals, regional and national chains of physical therapy clinics and hospitals, integrated delivery networks, group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), and government agencies. We sell products directly to these clinics, hospitals, and groups pursuant to preferred pricing arrangements. No single customer or group of related accounts was responsible for 10% or more of net sales in fiscal years 2021 and 2020.
 
 We export products to approximately 30 different countries. Sales outside North America totaled approximately $1,160,000 in fiscal year 2021 (or approximately 2.4% of net sales) and $1,286,000 in fiscal year 2020 (or approximately 2.4% of net sales). We have no foreign manufacturing operations, but we purchase certain products and components from foreign manufacturers.

  Competition
 
 We do not compete with a single competitor across all of our product lines. Our industry comprises numerous competitors of varying sizes, including personal care companies, branded consumer healthcare companies and private label manufacturers. Information necessary to determine or reasonably estimate our market share or that of any competitor in any of these markets of our highly fragmented industry is not readily available to us.
 
 We compete against various manufacturers and distributors, some of which are larger and more established, and have greater resources available to them, than Dynatronics. Our competitors in soft bracing products are primarily regional manufacturers, as well as several large corporations. Our competitors in treatment tables, exercise and rehabilitation equipment, and related supplies are from several domestic and international manufacturers and distributors.
 
 In the clinical market for therapeutic modality devices, we compete with both domestic and foreign companies. Several of our products are protected by patents or where patents have expired, the proprietary technology on which those patents were based. We believe that the integration of advanced technology in the design of our products has distinguished Dynatronics-branded products in this competitive market. For example, we were the first company to integrate infrared phototherapy as part of a combination therapy device. We believe these factors give us a competitive edge. Our primary domestic competitors in the therapeutic device manufacturing market include four large manufacturers.
 
 Trusted high-quality brands, on-time product delivery, and superior customer care are of key importance for us to remain competitive in this market and to maintain established relationships within our distribution channels.

 
  Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
 We produce Manufactured Products at our facilities in Northvale, New Jersey, Eagan, Minnesota, and Cottonwood Heights, Utah. The production of products historically manufactured in our Ooltewah, Tennessee facility have been transferred to our New Jersey and Minnesota facilities. Our Manufactured Products utilize custom components both fashioned internally from sourced raw materials, as well as components purchased from third-party suppliers. All parts and components purchased from third-party suppliers meet established specifications. Trained staff performs all sub-assembly, final assembly and quality assurance testing by following established procedures. Our design and development process ensures that Manufactured Products meet specified design requirements. We strive to manage the suppliers of components and materials to ensure their quality and availability for our manufacturing teams.
  
 Ascentron manufactures and assembles the Company's electrotherapy products, previously manufactured in our Utah facility, to specifications provided by the Company, and the Company purchases the finished products from Ascentron. The development and manufacture of a portion of our products manufactured to our specifications by Ascentron is subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and international regulatory agencies, as applicable. In compliance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and standards established by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, we have developed a comprehensive quality system that processes customer feedback and analyzes product performance trends. Conducting prompt reviews of timely information allows us to respond to customer needs to enhance quality performance of the devices we produce.
  
 Our Utah facility holds certification to ISO 13485:2016. Applicable quality systems enhance our ability to provide products and services that meet the expectations of our customers.
 
  Research and Development
 
 Total research and development (“R&D”) expenses in fiscal year 2021 were $10,000, compared to approximately $95,000 in fiscal year 2020.

  Regulatory Matters
 
 The manufacture, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates some of our products pursuant to the Medical Device Amendment of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and regulations promulgated under the FD&C Act. Advertising and other forms of promotion (including claims) and methods of marketing of the products are subject to regulation by the FDA and by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act, as applicable.
  
 As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and once registered we are subject to inspection for compliance with the FDA’s Quality Systems Regulations, as applicable. These regulations require us to manufacture our products and maintain related documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements for reportable events involving our devices. The FD&C Act and its medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA if allegations are made that one of our products has caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if a malfunction of a product would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. The FDA also prohibits an approved device from being marketed for unapproved uses. All of our therapeutic treatment devices, as currently designed, are cleared for marketing under section 510(k) of the Medical Device Amendment to the FD&C Act, or are considered 510(k) exempt. If a device is subject to section 510(k) clearance requirements, the FDA must receive pre-market notification from the manufacturer of its intent to market the device. The FDA must find that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device before the agency will clear the new device for marketing.
  
 We intend to continuously improve our products after they have been introduced into the market. Certain modifications to our marketed devices may require a pre-market notification and clearance before the changed device may be marketed, if the change or modification could significantly affect safety and/or effectiveness. As appropriate, we may therefore submit future 510(k) notifications to the FDA. No assurance can be given that clearance or approval of such new applications will be granted by the FDA on a timely basis, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data depending on the nature of the product changes. All of our devices, unless specifically exempted by regulation, are subject to the FD&C Act’s general controls, which include, among other things, registration and listing, adherence to the Quality System Regulation requirements for manufacturing, medical device reporting and the potential for voluntary and mandatory recalls described above.
  
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as the Affordable Care Act, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law. The passage of the Affordable Care Act imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain healthcare providers. Specifically, any transfer of value exceeding $10 in a single transfer or cumulative transfers over a one-year period exceeding $100 to any statutorily defined practitioner (primarily physicians, podiatrists, and chiropractors) must be reported to the federal government by March 31st of each year for the prior calendar year. The data is assembled and posted to a publicly accessible website by September 30th following the March 31st reporting date. If we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties. Several states have adopted similar reporting requirements. We believe we are in compliance with the Affordable Care Act and we have systems in place designed to achieve continued compliance.
 
 In March 2017, the FDA published guidance relating to Class II devices that would no longer be required to submit a pre-market notification (510(k)). This list was finalized in the Federal Register on July 11, 2017. Among the Class II devices exempted by this determination are some phototherapy devices such as those manufactured by us. That guidance indicates that such devices are considered safe and effective without adding the burden of a pre-market approval by the FDA. While this change diminishes the regulatory burden for such products, it also lowers the barriers to entry for competitive products. We view this change as generally positive for us and our ability to leverage existing technology competencies in this segment.
  
 Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal prosecutions. Any such action by the FDA could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products. Our Utah, Minnesota and New Jersey facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s cGMP and other requirements, including appropriate reporting regulations and various requirements for labeling and promotion.
  
 Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the FTC Act, as applicable. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Section 12 of the FTC Act provides that the dissemination or the causing to be disseminated of any false advertisement pertaining to, among other things, drugs, cosmetics, devices or foods, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all advertising claims made about our products. The type of substantiation required depends upon the product claims made.

 If the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g., a manufacturer or distributor does not possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of administrative and judicial processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of such orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any such action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.
  
 From time to time, legislation is introduced in the Congress of the United States or in state legislatures that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of medical devices and products like those we manufacture. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be on our business and our results of operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, domestically or internationally, would have on our business in the future. They could include, however, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. The necessity of complying with any or all such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
  
 In addition to compliance with FDA rules and regulations, we are also required to comply with international regulatory laws or other regulatory schemes used by other countries in which we choose to do business. Foreign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us. We believe all of our present products are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable performance standards in countries where the products are sold.
 
  Foreign Government Regulation
 
 Although it is not a current focus, we may expand our activities to market our products in select international markets in the future. The regulatory requirements for our products vary from country to country. Some countries impose product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on some of the products we manufacture and distribute. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Environment
 
 Environmental regulations and the cost of compliance with them are not material to our business. Numerous federal, state and local laws regulate the sale of products containing certain identified ingredients that may impact human health and the environment. For instance, California has enacted Proposition 65, which requires the disclosure of specified listed ingredient chemicals on the labels of products sold in that state and the use of warning labels when such ingredients may be found. We believe we are compliant with such regulations.
 Seasonality
 
 Our business is affected by some seasonality, which could result in fluctuation in our operating results. Sales are typically higher in our first and fourth fiscal quarters (the summer and spring months), while sales in our second and third fiscal quarters are generally lower (the fall and winter months). Therefore, our quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

  Employees
 
 As of June 30, 2021, we employed 175 people, of which 170 were employed on a full-time basis. Certain of our employees (38 individuals) are subject to a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in February 2022. We believe our labor relations with both union and non-union employees are satisfactory.
