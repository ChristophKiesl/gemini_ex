Item 1. Business
Overview
Qualtrics pioneered a new category of software, experience management, or XM, that enables organizations to find and fix broken experiences and drive operational improvements to improve customer loyalty, increase employee retention, and become a brand that people love. 
Qualtrics technology helps organizations find and keep customers, retain and engage employees, and improve their competitive position in their product categories and talent markets. Our XM Platform helps organizations listen to their employees and customers, understand their feedback, and then take action in response. 
Why It Matters:
The experiences organizations deliver are vital to their ability to compete and win. In 2022, half of consumers said they had cut spending or switched brands due to a poor experience, potentially impacting $3.1 trillion in global spending, according to the XM institute. The global pandemic, which has altered the way people work, shop, and interact with each other, accelerated a shift in nearly every expectation people have of businesses. 
Companies are facing an economic downturn, and they need to focus on the essentials – finding and keeping customers, retaining key employees, bringing the right products to market, and mitigating risks that exist in the business. They cannot afford customer churn, unexpected employee departures, or costly compliance issues. Qualtrics seeks to protect companies from these risks by helping them: 
•quickly identify points of friction in the customer journey – from the website to the contact center – and resolve issues immediately to win new customers and deepen customer satisfaction of existing ones; and
•understand exactly where and why employees are frustrated so they can quickly intervene to keep their employees productive and reduce unwanted attrition. 
And Qualtrics helps its customers to do this with empathy, speed, and scale. 
 Experience management is growing because businesses are facing unprecedented fluidity and risk. Nearly a quarter of a million people list “Qualtrics” as a skill on LinkedIn, and more than 5.6 million people list “experience management” as a skill, demonstrating our Company’s transformative influence on the world of work. Qualtrics helps companies get things right to attract great talent, develop loyalty among their customers, and build lasting, meaningful businesses and brands. 
Qualtrics is a mission-critical software platform that enables breakthrough design and continuous improvement of customer and employee experiences on a single, secure, cloud-native platform.
In addition to using surveys to collect post-transaction feedback to monitor trends in satisfaction scores, our XM Platform enables organizations to bring together all of their experience data, both structured and unstructured, analyze it with native advanced AI-powered analytics, and take real-time action to continually improve the experiences they deliver to their customers and employees. 
As of December 31, 2022, the Qualtrics XM Platform is trusted by more than 18,750 customers of all sizes, including over 90% of the Fortune 100. The broad adoption of our platform is facilitated by a multi-pronged go-to-market model comprised of inside and field sales teams, joint solution selling with SAP, and our growing Qualtrics Partner Network (“QPN”) of over 400 global member companies that are partnering with us on our platform to help drive breakthrough business outcomes for our customers. 
Qualtrics is a system of action that guides users with specific instructions for improvement and automated actions to improve experiences. It provides each individual employee in an organization a powerful, easy-to-use interface that creates everyday habits to take action on feedback from customers and employees. It has the power to change organizational behavior and create a culture of action. 
The Qualtrics XM Platform 
The Qualtrics XM Platform helps organizations design the next set of experiences that will attract new customers and employees, and then continuously improve each of those experiences to stay relevant, retain customers and employees, and become even more competitive across the four core experiences of business—employee, customer, brand, and product.
In 2022, the Qualtrics XM Platform reached 10 billion Experience iDs over the life of the XM Platform—serving as the largest human sentiment database in the world. Innovations on the XM Platform have deepened Qualtrics’ ability to give organizations quick, actionable insights to drive business results, and deepen their customer relationships. 
Qualtrics captures every form of customer and employee feedback, including survey responses, contact center chat interactions, social media posts, product reviews, and more. With advanced machine learning and AI, Qualtrics analyzes this data to understand the emotion, effort, and intent behind the words. Experience iD captures all of this customer experience data in a single profile, creating a digital history of all user interactions and experiences over time in a single view.
Qualtrics’ AI technology captures aggregated data, offering organizations insights to help them take the right action to improve customer experiences. The data captured within XiD also enables development of a library of benchmark metrics, such as Customer Satisfaction (“CSAT”) and Net Promoter Score (“NPS”), so companies can assess their results against their peers.
Listen - Experience ID: Listen to every customer, and remember what they need 
Experience iD offers a single, unified view of every form of customer and employee feedback, including survey responses, contact center chat interactions, social media posts, product reviews and more. 
Qualtrics’ AI technology captures aggregated data within the 10 billion Experience iD profiles, offering organizations deeper insights to help them take the right action to improve customer experiences. 
Understand - Understand what’s happening, why it’s happening, and take action
Qualtrics XM Discover helps organizations listen to, analyze and act on everything that customers and employees are saying on every platform with omnichannel conversational analytics, extending the power of Qualtrics to understand the emotion, intensity, and effort behind every customer and employee experience. By adding Discover to the Qualtrics XM Platform, it is simple and scalable for companies to ask people how they feel about their experiences, analyze the data with sophisticated analytics, and take action on feedback, whether they offered it through surveys or other places people share their experiences, such as customer service chats, social media, or online product reviews. 
With Qualtrics CrossXM, company leaders can learn how their employee, customer and brand experiences impact one another, helping them identify the actions they can take to drive the biggest impact across their business. This innovation allows them to understand how key employee experience metrics, such as manager support, career development, and recognition, have a direct, statistically significant impact on customer outcomes. With these insights, leaders can focus on initiatives that will drive the most value for employees and customers. 
Qualtrics has advanced natural language processing, or NLP, in 23 languages and over 150 categorization models to measure sentiment (the positivity or negative of comments), effort (the ease or difficulty expressed within feedback), emotions, empathy, intent, and more.
Act - Build a culture of action 
With Experience Workflows, or xFlow, the Qualtrics XM Platform can automatically route recommended actions to the people in the best position to address issues with customers or employees using experience workflow automation. Employees can log into a role-based account and receive alerts relevant to their role and be given specific actions to drive improvement. The system tracks issues, progress, and next steps to help monitor progress and keep managers informed.
The Qualtrics XM Platform is well positioned to solve the key challenges companies are struggling with around the world today. 
With Qualtrics, teams are empowered with the ability to build and save experience workflows that can be shared and scaled across departments, retail locations, or global deployments. Built with an open API architecture, our highly configurable platform provides a robust ecosystem of integrations for automating and connecting the entire experience management process—from collecting experience feedback from any third-party channel, to uncovering hidden trends using native or third-party analysis, to driving activities and action using any operational system that employees already use as part of their existing routines. These automated solutions are available out of the box, purpose-built for specific industries, departments, and geographies. 
What Sets Us Apart
Our approach to architecting solutions and how we bring those solutions to our customers has enabled us to strengthen our lead in the experience management (XM) category. We pioneered the XM category two decades ago and remain a recognized market leader in the category today. We are the leading and largest pure-play XM provider in the market. Our brand is synonymous with experience management and associated with quality and usability, providing us an advantage with attracting new customers. We are also thought leaders in the market. Through our founding of the XM Institute, we deliver a wide variety of industry-specific content, leadership, training, networking, and research to help XM leaders develop and excel in their jobs.
We have several distinguishing advantages:
•Single Cloud Native Platform. Qualtrics allows organizations to manage the experiences of customers and employees on a single, connected platform. Organizations power experience management programs across their customer, employee, product, and brand, monitor the health of their entire business through robust analytics and dashboards, and drive action across the entire organization from one common interface.
•Ability to Address Experience Holistically. We provide specific solutions across the key areas that have the highest impact on an organization: customers, employees, product, and brand. CrossXM analyzes experiences within customers, employees, and brands individually and correlates data across areas to provide targeted actions leaders can make to impact business results and customer outcomes. Our XM Platform integrates experience, or X-data that we collect with siloed operational, or O-data, that organizations already have, providing everyone in an organization from the C-suite to employees on the front line with a holistic view of experiences across key areas and constituencies and a clear set of actions they can take to have the biggest impact. 
•Combined Insights from all Sources of Feedback. Qualtrics XM Discover, a new set of products launched in 2022, helps companies tune into conversations that are already happening and build a richer understanding of what customers and employees want and expect. XM Discover extends the Qualtrics XM Platform’s AI and machine learning capabilities, analyzing conversations in 23 languages and consisting of more than 150 out-of-the-box models tuned into the nuanced terminologies and discussions that happen across industries. Based on customer and employee interactions, organizations can capture, at scale: 
◦emotions and emotional intensity across a spectrum of 50+ emotions; 
◦the customer’s or employee’s intent – what they were trying to accomplish; 
◦how much effort a customer or employee had to expend at any step of their journey; and 
◦the presence or absence of empathy in a conversation. 
With this addition, organizations can use Qualtrics to gather experience data from any structured and unstructured source, analyze it with sophisticated AI and machine learning, and take action to deliver better customer and employee experiences. 
•Built for Action. Qualtrics xFlow helps organizations build a culture of action through a low code / no-code interface to create automated workflows to close experience gaps at scale. xFlow enables organizations to automate experience workflows to drive action natively or by integrating with systems that an organization already uses. For example, with our analytics-driven Smart Routing, our XM Platform can automatically generate a customer ticket and action to resolution when a negative sentiment is expressed on a social media site. In this way, our XM Platform not only helps to identify issues, but also serves as a system of action by automatically directing feedback and recommended actions to the teams that are in the best position to make improvements. Or the system can bypass the need for employees to resolve issues and instead automate service recovery so customer or employee issues do not slip through the cracks. xFlow works across our XM Platform and provides automatic notifications, raises tickets, and closes experience gaps immediately.
•Real-time Insight. Our XM Platform uses advanced AI and machine learning to extract feedback and provide real-time coaching, insights and analysis. This timeliness is necessary to affect outcomes, including reducing churn, increasing sales, preventing employee turnover, increasing engagement, and enhancing brand among others. 
•Enterprise Ready. Our XM Platform is scalable and secure. We have built our XM Platform on open-source technologies that are designed to scale horizontally to support large-scale streaming and batch processing, with ‘always-on’ infrastructure. As an example of our scalability, up to one million healthcare providers within the Aetna network link customer digital behavior with net promoter score, or NPS, and customer satisfaction, or CSAT, across their 22 million customers on our XM Platform. Our XM Platform adheres to the high standards of security and privacy demanded by the largest organizations in the world. Our XM Platform enables role-based permissioning to ensure that the right people have access to sensitive customer and employee information. We are ISO 27001 certified and enable our customers to maintain their compliance with General Data Protection Guidelines, or GDPR and SOC2, and we are certified on Health Information Alliance Trust, or HITRUST. We have achieved Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, authorization to deliver services to United States federal government agencies. Additionally, organizations own and retain all their data gathered on our XM Platform.
•Easy Adoption and Rapid Time to Value. Our technology is designed to be easy to deploy, configure, use, and scale. By making the complex capabilities of our XM Platform simple to use, we allow customers of all types and sizes to generate value quickly. In addition, the modularity of our XM Platform allows our customers to deploy one or more of our solutions initially and then adopt additional modules as their use cases grow and evolve. As initial deployments generate valuable X-data and the value of that data compounds over time, we see many customers adding additional functionality as the power and influence of experience management insights spread throughout their organizations. 
•Powerful and Multi-Pronged Go-to-Market Model. Our powerful go-to-market model enables us to land both small and large customers initially and expand those relationships significantly over time. The broad adoption of our XM Platform is facilitated by a multi-pronged go-to-market model comprising highly productive field and inside-sales teams, a joint development and solution selling partnership with SAP, and our robust and growing QPN. QPN has over 400 global member companies partnering with us on our XM Platform to help drive breakthrough business outcomes for joint customers. The Qualtrics Developer Platform, or QDP, a core element of QPN, provides deep technical capabilities that enable companies to build robust XM extensions and deliver automated workflows to drive action.
Our Growth Strategies
Key elements of our growth strategies include:
•Drive New Customer Sales. We believe that our market opportunity remains largely under penetrated. We estimate that our total addressable market is $60 billion. We will continue to invest aggressively in our direct and indirect sales and marketing capabilities to continue to acquire new customers, including continued growth in the number of enterprise customers. We plan to continue to acquire new customers with our powerful multi-pronged go-to-market model.
•Expand Within Existing Customers. Our customer base of more than 18,750 organizations as of December 31, 2022, represents a significant growth opportunity for us. There is opportunity to expand both the number of users and use cases within an organization. As users start to focus more deeply on specific experiences, they often look to add integrated solutions, CustomerXM, EmployeeXM, ProductXM, BrandXM, and DesignXM. We offer a flexible pricing model that helps further expand our presence within organizations as they increase volume of responses, add solutions and integrations, grow users and employees and increase features and workflows within each solution. Our goal is to increase the number of customers that standardize on our XM Platform within their organization, increasing the number of our organization-wide deployments and creating opportunity for expanded use cases. 
•Expand Our Global Presence. A key focus of our company is to continue to penetrate unaddressed global markets. Constituents can provide feedback in over 75 languages, and our core admin user interface supports over 20 languages. To penetrate markets outside North America, we have developed a hub-and-spoke sales model comprised of centralized inside-sales teams surrounded by regional direct sales groups. Our first two hubs outside North America were in Dublin, Ireland and Sydney, Australia. We have opened sales offices in additional countries, including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Sweden, Spain, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. To address data sovereignty concerns among our international customers, we have data centers in Canada, Germany, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Australia. We believe that this investment should further increase our international expansion opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 30% of our revenue came from markets outside the United States, and we believe that there is significant opportunity for continued growth in the global markets.
•Continue to Innovate and Enhance Our XM Platform. As we add to our customer base, we use our technology to draw insights and ensure that we are best serving our customers’ needs. These insights lead to innovative features, such as XM Solutions for creating faster time-to-value, XM Benchmarks to derive deeper insights, XM Automated Actions to quickly close identified experience gaps, and improvements in our iQ product features to drive intelligent action taking. These innovations lead to a greater value proposition for our customers and increased adoption of our XM Platform by both new and existing customers.
•Grow Revenue from Key Industry Verticals. While our XM Platform is industry-agnostic, we have made a number of industry-specific investments that will accelerate our adoption within certain verticals, including government, education, healthcare, technology, and financial services. We have developed Certified XM Solutions, leveraging partners’ expertise, and embedding industry-specific content into our products. Our Certified XM Solutions are packaged projects and programs with expert content, workflow, and automation. In every key vertical, we have reference customers that we believe validate the adoption of our XM Platform.
•Further Develop Our Partner Ecosystem. We have developed a network of leading and consulting partners, delivery partners, and technology partners who enrich our offerings, scale our coverage, and help us reach a broader audience than we would be able to reach on our own. Our partner channel extends our sales reach, enhances our products, and provides implementation leverage both domestically and internationally. Since the launch of QPN in 2018, we have entered into many impactful partnerships with over 400 global member companies, including Accenture, Ernst & Young, Deloitte, IBM, J.D. Power, and Kantar. During 2019, we launched the Qualtrics Developer Platform as a core element of QPN. We will continue to partner with other leading organizations to broaden our reach and maintain our strong net retention rates.
•Jointly Develop, Market and Sell our Solutions with SAP. As part of SAP, we have been able to utilize our partnership to grow and enhance our business. We will continue to jointly develop, market, and sell our solutions with SAP. SAP has a global footprint, which has allowed us to reach new geographies and expand our international presence faster. Our go-to-market motion has greater enterprise reach through SAP’s global customer base, allowing Qualtrics to be sold alongside SAP applications through our solution selling partnership.

These tools are used by market research professionals, marketing teams, product teams, HR teams, academics, insights professionals, data analysts, and developers to do advanced market, customer, and employee research. These customers use DesignXM to adopt a self-service approach to conducting a wide variety of research projects that formerly required hiring expensive outsourced consultants.
Our DesignXM solution can be purchased as software only or can be packaged with expert research services delivered in house, or via our ecosystem partners. 
Qualtrics Developer Platform
The Qualtrics Developer Platform, or QDP, enables customers to seamlessly integrate Qualtrics with their existing applications and workflows and extend the functionality of the XM Platform. QDP includes a robust set of developer tools—including Software Developer Kits, or SDKs, APIs, and workflow configuration tools—for our customers or third-party developers to build data connectors, widgets, plug-ins, visualizations, workflows, and automations. Leveraging the QDP, customers can connect Qualtrics with third-party software systems to automate key business processes, enhance their XM program by bringing experience data from other listening posts into Qualtrics, and extend the XM Platform to address their specific business requirements.
Through the QDP, we provide over 140 out-of-the-box integrations, primarily built through XM Extensions, across 30 complementary technology categories with leading enterprise solutions like SAP, Adobe, Atlassian, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, and Zendesk, and applications in adjacent software categories such as digital experience, social analytics, user research, help desk and support, and contact center management. The aforementioned XM Extensions, along with select partner solutions, can be marketed and sold on the XM Marketplace, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by our innovation partners. 
Modern Data Processing Architecture
Over 160 million interactions are analyzed and over 100 million distinct responses are generated each month on our XM Platform. Each piece of X-data represents a distinct data stream, which are combined with related streams generated from social media, enterprise, and third-party integrations via API. Our XM Platform continually aggregates these data streams to provide up-to-the-minute analytics, as well as near real-time analysis across billions of historical data points collected. Our architecture is designed to scale horizontally and cost effectively by combining the Platform-as-a-Service offerings available in public cloud data center facilities and modern open-source technology stacks running within our co-location data centers.
Information Security as a Key Business Enabler
We have achieved multiple information security certifications, including the globally recognized ISO 27001 standard in addition to FedRAMP certification to authorize the use of our XM Platform for U.S. Federal Government agencies. These certifications require ongoing independent validation of our compliance frameworks to provide our customers with confidence in choosing our XM Platform. Our premium Data Isolation feature protects customer response data with a customer specific encryption key. Qualtrics provides our customers with self-service tools to help comply with privacy frameworks such as GDPR.
Research and Development
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, testing, and quality of our XM Platform. We focus our efforts on developing our core technologies and further enhancing their usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility. We prioritize research and development and attempt to foster creativity and autonomy in our engineering teams.

Customers
As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 18,750 customers using our XM Platform in more than 120 countries. We have key reference customers in many industry verticals that we believe validate our solutions in the market, and our customers range from small and medium-sized organizations to Fortune 100 companies. 
Our Go-To-Market Strategy
Our XM Platform is used by more than 18,750 customers of all sizes globally across a broad range of industries, including over 90% of the Fortune 100 as of December 31, 2022. No one industry comprises more than 15% of our revenues, with banking, professional & business services, technology, education, and healthcare making up the top five. Our XM Platform has been adopted by many of the world’s largest organizations that view us as a strategic partner in their digital transformation initiatives. 
This broad adoption of our XM Platform is facilitated by a multi-pronged go-to-market model comprised of highly productive inside and field sales teams, a joint development and solution selling partnership with SAP, and our robust and growing QPN. We primarily generate sales through our direct sales team, which includes both inside and field sales personnel. All sales personnel focus on attracting new customers as well as expanding usage within our existing customer base. Our sales team is supported by technical sales professionals and subject-matter experts who facilitate the sales process through developing and presenting demonstrations of our XM Platform after assessing requirements, addressing security and technical questions, and matching customer needs with the appropriate Qualtrics solutions. We also have a team of solution experts who help advise on best practices and methodologies, assist with program design, and provide assistance as required through customer launch to accelerate time to value. Our customer success team complements our sales team by consulting with our customers and helping drive adoption, subscription renewal, expansion to additional use cases, and customer value.
Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our XM Platform, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of loyal customers and users. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including user conferences (such as our annual X4 Summit), online advertising, webinars, blogs, corporate communications, white papers, and case studies.
We also work with partners through QPN, which has over 400 global member companies delivering breakthrough business outcomes for our customers.
QPN consists of the following: 
•Strategic Partners offer a full suite of capabilities to accelerate XM within customers’ organizations, including implementation, consulting, and XM program and solution design. Strategic partners include Accenture, Bain, Capgemini, Deloitte, EY, and others.
•Innovation Partners bring XM into customers’ existing IT ecosystems and augment the capabilities of our XM Platform. Leveraging the Qualtrics Developer Platform, customers can connect Qualtrics to third-party software systems to automate key business processes, enhance their XM programs by bringing experience data from other listening posts into Qualtrics, and extend our XM Platform to address their specific business requirements. Innovation partners include enterprise software leaders such as Adobe, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and independent software vendors in adjacent software categories (e.g., digital experience, social listening & analytics, user research).
•Advisory Partners are trusted XM scientists and consultants trained on our XM Platform. They work with customers to design plans and roadmaps for starting their experience management journeys. Advisory partners include Ipsos, JD Power, Kantar TNS, and many more.

Enterprise organizations work with these accredited partners to scope and implement XM programs and to provide ongoing platform customizations. Delivery partners include Acumen Solutions, Ugam (a Merkle company), Workforce Science Associates, and many others.
We will continue to jointly develop, market, and sell our solutions with SAP. Examples include the use of our XM Platform within SAP SuccessFactors to gauge employee sentiment at various stages of the employee lifecycle and create workflows to resolve experience gaps that might lead to dissatisfaction and employee attrition, within SAP’s e-commerce applications to listen and act upon customer sentiment to drive higher conversion rates as consumer buying behavior moves online, and within procurement applications to enable buyers and suppliers to better understand and collaborate with each other. In addition, we have a robust roadmap of potential areas of collaboration across SAP’s product portfolio. As an independent subsidiary of SAP, we will aim to replicate those collaborations with a broader ecosystem of partners. 
Professional Services
Our professional services team helps customers design and execute their market intelligence projects, through our DesignXM offering, and provides our customers with implementation, training, and similar services to help them realize the full benefits of our XM Platform. Our training programs include a mix of virtual and in-person offerings with different options focused either on helping onboard teams of users quickly or helping individuals achieve certification level subject matter expertise. Our team works closely with our partners and enables them to deploy our solutions. By working with these partners, we both augment our pipeline and our ability to scale globally by size and complexity of deployment.
Competition
Experience management is a new and rapidly developing software category. Certain features of our XM Platform compete in certain segments of the overall experience management market. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
•Providers of software for specific use cases, such as Medallia for customer experience;
•Traditional professional and marketing research services firms, such as Aon Hewitt and Towers Watson; and
•Individual-focused and self-service survey tools, such as Momentive.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:
•Product features, quality, functionality, and design;
•Ease of deployment and use;
•Market vision and pace of product innovation;
•Security and privacy;
•Overall platform experience;
•Third-party integrations; 
•Pricing and total cost of ownership; 
•Brand awareness and reputation;
•Accessibility across several devices, operating systems, and applications;
•Strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•Customer support.
Some of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. Moreover, because our market is new and rapidly developing, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid technology and content development cycles or lower marketing costs, could introduce new products and services that disrupt our market and better address the needs of our customers and potential customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The experience management software category is relatively new and rapidly changing, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed” for additional information.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of international and domestic registered, pending, and common law trademarks to protect our brand.
In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and other contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Further, many companies in the communications and technology industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may face in the future allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights” for additional information.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonality in billings with our customers, and we typically record a higher percentage of billings in our fourth quarter, as we have historically executed many of our contracts in the third and fourth quarters due to the fiscal year ends and procurement cycles of our customers. 
Corporate Information
We were formed in 2002 as Qualtrics Labs, Inc. In 2012, Qualtrics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, was established as a new parent company for our operating business. In September 2014, we incorporated Qualtrics International Inc. in Delaware. Through a corporate restructuring in September 2014, Qualtrics, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qualtrics International Inc. In January 2019, we were acquired by SAP America, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP SE (“SAP”), a multinational corporation that is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany. In January 2021, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “XM.” SAP continues to be our controlling shareholder.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 5,600 full-time employees. We also engage contractors and consultants from time to time. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Our Values
Our mission is to make business more human. Our values are TACOS: that’s Transparency, All-In, Customer Obsessed, One Team, and Scrappy. 
Our values support how we achieve our mission and how we engage with each other and our customers.
This is how we explain our values—we are transparent with each other and openly share our goals, strengths and improvement areas as one diverse and inclusive team. We are committed to helping our customers succeed and deliver results with care and responsibility. We are innovators and creative problem solvers.
This is not just who we are, but what we do. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
We seek for ourselves representation that matches the world around us and inclusion that far exceeds it. We will use our people, processes, and technology to measure progress and aim to become a guiding light for our customers to do the same. 
DEI is a cornerstone of our company culture and embedded into our People strategy. We transparently share progress internally and externally to remain accountable. 
We believe in pay equity and proactively measure for gender and racial gaps. 
We believe in measurable inclusion and use our technology to measure overall inclusion at our company. 
We want everyone to bring their whole selves to work. Our employee resource groups and business resource groups play a vital role in creating a culture of inclusion. These are entirely run by our employees with the support and backing of our company. By the end of 2022, close to 50% of all Qualtrics employees belong to a community group.
Our communities include (among others):
•Disability: our employee resource group called Q&Able empowers all employees, regardless of their ability, to succeed by promoting accessibility in physical and online spaces for employees and clients with mental, intellectual, and/or physical disabilities;
•Gender: our employee resource group called Women's Leadership Development has a mission to empower all women at Qualtrics to globally thrive through attracting and developing top talent and elevating the voices of all women;
•LGBTQ+: our employee resource group called Q Pride makes Qualtrics a welcoming place to work for members of the LGBTQ+ community;
•Racial and Ethnic Minorities: our employee resource group called MosaiQ aims to advance the careers, goals, and well-being of racial and ethnic minorities by intentionally and continuously creating spaces for them to connect, amplifying their voices, and supporting their professional careers;
•Sustainability: our business resource group called The Green Team is a vibrant community of employees who are passionately helping Qualtrics be a force for good in creating a healthier planet; and
•Veterans: our employee resource group called Q Salute builds a community and camaraderie that enables successful careers for Veterans and their families in the civilian world starting at Qualtrics.
