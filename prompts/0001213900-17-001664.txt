Description of Business
 
SGB is in the business of modifying cargo shipping containers for use in construction. SGB takes existing steel shipping containers and repurposes them into modules that can be stacked, arranged, or configured to fit any construction application. The use of these repurposed shipping containers, now called “SG BlocksTM,” allows architects, builders, and owners more design flexibility and greater construction efficiency than traditional methods of construction. SG BlocksTM also have a particular application in meeting safe and sustainable housing needs, especially in hurricane- and earthquake-prone areas.
 
Rather than using new steel and lumber, SGB capitalizes on the structural engineering and design parameters a shipping container must meet and repurposes them for use in building. Offering a product that typically exceeds building code requirements, SGB enables developers, architects, builders, and owners to achieve more efficient construction, faster execution, and stronger buildings of higher value and extended life. Since inception, SGB has developed and implemented the technology to provide an alternative to traditional site-based construction at reduced cost and is committed to providing a construction methodology that will lessen the global carbon footprint.
 
SGB does not simply recycle old shipping containers (which requires additional energy consumption to break down material and then reform it for another purposes)—it utilizes existing steel shipping container structures and repurposes them into modules that can be put to a higher and better use with significantly less energy input. Each container is a building block module that can be arranged in virtually any stacking configuration to create the spaces and volumes needed. Architectural creativity combined with engineering expertise is used in stacking and arranging the blocks, which can be interconnected and modified to suit specific building space requirements. The SG BlocksTM system affords architects, owners, and builders flexibility and creative opportunities.
 
SGB first selects shipping containers appropriate for a given project, which are then redesigned to customer specifications. These durable steel containers are modified or manufactured into SG BlocksTM. A combination of engineering and architecture is used to make the containers adaptable for a wide variety of commercial and residential uses. Criteria and testing processes have been developed to evaluate each container. Conversion and assembly is subjected to quality control, making the containers “code-ready.”

Only containers bearing an approval plate from the CSC may be reconfigured into an SG BlockTM. The CSC approval plate confirms that the containers were tested and certified as strong enough to withstand the extreme pressures and lateral forces involved in shipping. In addition, before selection as an SG BlockTM, every container is inspected for structural damage, out-of-plane dents, warping, water tightness, and overall condition. These steps assure SGB that the specific container will be strong enough for use in construction applications.
 
SG BlocksTM can be used to build virtually any style of construction, from traditional to modern, and can be delivered with a highly durable surface finish or ready to be clad with any type of standard or green technology-friendly building skin.
 
SGB uses an outsource model, whereby we maintain low overhead costs and partner with third parties to reduce risks along the supply chain. This allows us to operate with low fixed costs and gives us flexibility to scale our business response to fluctuating demand.
 
Environmentally Responsible Building
 
Environmentally friendly building is the practice of designing, constructing, operating, maintaining, and removing buildings in ways that conserve natural resources and reduce their impact on the environment. Builders are increasingly incorporating “green” components in all projects as they adopt the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) system, a third-party certification program and the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high performance green buildings. We believe the SG BlocksTM system contributes significantly towards LEED certification for completed projects by using a repurposed product and through geographic proximity to the construction site and helping minimize the wasteful practices of traditional construction methods.
 
The Process of the SG Blocks™ Conversion
 
The robust structure of a shipping container is the beginning of the SG BlocksTM system. Our intermodal framing system allows us to customize the dimensions of a modular unit by expanding the ceilings or walls to client needs, while maintaining the strength and ease of stacking that a shipping container provides. Various combinations of siding, brick, and stucco can be added and the interior finished as any conventional structure would be. Upon completion, structures look and feel as if they were erected using traditional construction methods. However, the SGB product is generally stronger, more durable, environmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods.
 
SGB starts by selecting containers that are approved by the CSC. All CSC approved containers bear a CSC approval plate that is used to track their movement in trade. The CSC approval plate is also used to verify that the container has been tested and is considered to be able to withstand all of the lateral forces and pressures it could potentially experience while in use. The presence of the CSC plate confirms that the containers were built in compliance with rigorous international standards. Prior to being used as an SG BlockTM, each container is recertified as meeting these original standards of strength and rigidity.

SGB then provides specific and detailed engineering and fabrication details to qualified contractors and subcontractors who proceed to modify the containers in various configurations, which often requires structural changes, wall reconfigurations, the creation of window and door openings, and ceiling alterations to allow sheetrock hanging. The exterior walls and roof structure are then insulated with a high-tech waterproof ceramic insulation. Next, the SG BlocksTM are either shipped directly to the building site or are run through a modular factory and then delivered to the site. The builder, generally under contract with SGB, places the SG BlocksTM into position on their foundation and connects them together by welding. The builder may add roof trusses or other roof systems, quickly creating an insulated structure under roof. The potential for savings in building time can be significant, particularly if interior pre-finish modularization is introduced at this step.
 
Our Industry
 
The building industry has a reputation for resistance to change. By and large, the industry still erects structures using materials such as concrete, lumber, and steel as they have for centuries. The deployment of those materials also takes readily recognizable forms. Concrete may be pre-cast or poured in place. Low-rise development may use block-and-plank construction that is little different from 19th-century techniques. High-rise steel frame and curtain wall buildings have been around since the first generation of skyscrapers.
 
Off-site construction—prefabricated or modular building—is working through its growing pains. Factory-built housing has been around for some time, but adapting the concept to high-rise projects is a newer process. Quality control and the ability to scale up modular construction remain issues, but in the past two years alone, modular building has made large strides towards adapting its concept to high-rise projects.
    Fabricating whole segments of buildings in a facility and shipping the completed units to the site provides both cost and speed advantages compared to traditional construction methods. Weather is also less of a factor in our modular construction process.
 
Other benefits to modular construction include more efficient workplace supervision and better training. The controlled construction environment and assembly line techniques remove many of the problems encountered during traditional construction, such as theft, vandalism, damage to building products and materials, and unskilled labor. Factory employees are trained and managed more effectively and efficiently than on-site contract labor, resulting in better quality and better project management with the trades. This is especially significant because of the country-wide decline in the number of skilled laborers.
 
Finally, our methods also benefit the greater community by reducing congestion, noise, and dust at the site—a not-insignificant advantage for project sponsors.
 
Target Markets
 
SGB sells into a multi-billion dollar market for new construction in North America. SGB believes that SG BlocksTM have a particular application in a number of segments, including:

● | Multi-Family Housing 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the use of SG BlocksTM can be an attractive option in the market for construction of multi-family housing units, as total construction spending on private multi-family residential units has increased in recent years.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
The construction industry is highly competitive. SGB competes against numerous local, regional, national, and international builders around the world. SGB is committed to educating the building community on the benefits of its technology and positioning SG BlocksTM as complementary to their strategy, rather than as competition. SGB may compete for building opportunities with entities that possess greater financial, marketing and other resources than it does. Competition may increase if there is future consolidation in the land development and construction industry or from new building technologies that could arise.


We believe SGB can distinguish itself from its competitors on the basis of quality, cost, and construction time. SGB’s buildings are constructed through the connection of heavy gauge steel shipping containers that exceed traditional construction quality. SGB’s construction method is typically less expensive than traditional construction methods, particularly in urban locations and multi-story projects. Construction time is also generally reduced by using SGB’s construction method, reducing both construction and soft costs substantially. The SG BlocksTM are designed to be hurricane-, tornado-, and earthquake-resistant, and able to withstand harsh climate conditions. Their flexibility of construction allows architects, developers, and owners to design SG BlocksTM to meet their needs.
