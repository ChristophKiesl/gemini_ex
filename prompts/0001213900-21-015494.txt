ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
 
Company Profile
 
GreenVision Acquisition Corp is a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 11, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of engaging in a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses or entities. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in North America, Europe and Asia (excluding China) in the life sciences and healthcare industries. In connection with our listing application with the Nasdaq Stock Market, we agreed that we would not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China.
 
On November 21, 2019, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,750,000 units (the “Units”), inclusive of the over-allotment option of 750,000 Units. Each unit consisted of one share of common stock, par value $0.00001, one redeemable warrant, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of common stock upon consummation of a business combination. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated a private placement (“Private Placement”) with its sponsor, GreenVision Capital Holdings LLC. (“Sponsor”) for the purchase of 2,100,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $2,100,000, pursuant to the Sponsor Subscription Agreement dated September 19, 2019. In addition, the Company sold to I-Bankers Securities Inc., for $100, a share purchase warrant to purchase up to 287,500 shares exercisable at $12.00 per share, commencing on the later of the consummation of the Company’s initial business combination and 360 days from the effective date of the Registration Statement, pursuant to the Share Purchase Warrant dated November 21, 2019.
 
As of November 21, 2019, a total of $57,500,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders. Subsequently, we have twice elected to extend the period within which we must complete a business combination by three months and have deposited an aggregate of $1,150,000 into the trust account in connection with such extensions.
 
Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates and engaging in non-binding discussions with potential target entities. We have had losses since inception from incurring formation and operating costs since completion of our IPO.
 
Recent Developments
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
On August 26, 2020, we entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “AHA Merger Agreement”) with GreenVision Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of GreenVision (“Merger Sub”), Accountable Healthcare America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“AHA”) and Michael Bowen, in his capacity as the representative of the AHA shareholders. Pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub was anticipated to merge with and into AHA (the “AHA Merger”), with AHA surviving the merger in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law as our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
On November 13, 2020, we received a notice from AHA pursuant to the Merger Agreement that the proposed purchases by AHA of Jupiter Medical Group, Inc. (“JMG”), Primary Care Associates, Inc. (“PCA”) and Health Promoters LLC (“HP”) had been terminated by the representatives of each of JMG, PCA and HP. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, AHA’s obligation to purchase JMG, PCA and HP was a condition to closing of the transactions contemplated by the AHA Merger Agreement. We concluded that the inability of AHA to consummate these proposed acquisitions constituted a breach of the covenant that such transactions be completed prior to the closing date and further results in a material adverse effect. Accordingly, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we had the right to immediately terminate the Merger Agreement. Although we provided AHA with a period of ten (10) days to cure this event, AHA was not able to effect a cure and on November 24, 2020, we sent a notice to AHA, effective immediately, to terminate the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the termination notice, we expressly reserved all our rights and remedies under the AHA Merger Agreement

On February 8, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Helbiz Merger Agreement”) with GreenVision Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of GreenVision (“Merger Sub”), Helbiz, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Helbiz”) and Salvatore Palella, in his capacity as the representative of the Helbiz shareholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into Helbiz (the “Helbiz Merger”), with Helbiz surviving the merger in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the related ancillary agreements, the “Business Combination”). Helbiz provides tech-driven, on-demand transportation solutions that help people move seamlessly within cities. It focuses on micro-mobility and strives to provide first- and last-mile transportation solutions in urban environments.
 
The aggregate consideration payable at the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”) to the stockholders of Helbiz will be the issuance of such number of shares of our Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Common Stock”) as shall be determined by subtracting the “Closing Net Debt” of Helbiz (as defined in the Merger Agreement) from the agreed valuation of $300,000,000, and dividing such difference by $10.00, which represents the agreed valuation of one share of our Common Stock. The total number of shares of our Common Stock to be issued at Closing, following the determination of the final Closing Net Debt, shall be subject to reduction for Indemnification Escrow Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement) for indemnification claims, as described below. Of the shares to be delivered at Closing, the holders of Helbiz common stock will receive, in exchange for the Helbiz shares owned by such persons, shares of a class of our Common Stock to be established and designated as “Class A Common Stock”, except that Helbiz shares owned by Salvatore Palella, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Helbiz (the “Founder”) will instead be exchanged for a number of shares of a class of our Common Stock to be established and designated as “Class B Common Stock”. The number of shares of our Common Stock (whether Class A or Class B) that each Helbiz shareholder shall receive will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the number of shares of common stock of Helbiz held by such stockholders by the Closing Consideration Conversion Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
 
The shares of Class B Common Stock will have the same economic terms as the shares of Class A Common Stock in all material respects, but the shares of Class A Common Stock will be entitled to one (1) vote per share, and the shares of Class B Common Stock will be entitled to such number of votes per share, so that the total number of Class B Common Stock issued to Founder represent, in the aggregate, no more than 60% of all of our voting securities on a fully-diluted basis for a period of up to 24 months from the Closing. Except for certain permitted transfers, any shares of Class B Common Stock that are transferred by the Founder will automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock (i) at the option of such holder to convert such shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock or (ii) upon the earlier of the death of Founder, the consent of a majority of the holders of Class B Common Stock, or a date that is 2 years from the Closing of the Business Combination.
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Helbiz Merger Agreement are subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Helbiz Merger Agreement, the Helbiz Merger and certain other actions related thereto by our stockholders, and the availability of a minimum amount of cash in our trust account, after giving effect to redemptions by the Company’s public stockholders, if any. Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the Helbiz Business Combination.
 
Extensions
 
Pursuant to the AHA Merger Agreement, AHA provided the sum of $575,000 (the “Transaction Deposit”) at execution to us which funds were utilized to fund the deposit required to extend the existence of GreenVision from November 21, 2020 to February 21, 2021, if we determine to proceed with the extension in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. On November 13, 2020, we had elected to extend the time to complete a business combination with AHA until February 21, 2021 and deposited the funds provided by AHA into our trust account. As previously reported, however, on November 24, we terminated the AHA Merger Agreement. Effective upon termination of the AHA Merger agreement on November 24, 2020, we are entitled to receive a break-up fee of $3,750,000 which is to be reduced by the Transaction Deposit. As of December 31, 2020, the $575,000 was reflected as a contribution to equity in our consolidated balance sheets.
 
Upon execution of the Helbiz Merger Agreement, Helbiz provided a transaction deposit in the sum of $750,000 to us, of which, $575,000 may be utilized to provide all or a portion of the deposit required to extend the existence of GreenVision from February 21, 2021 to May 21 2021. On February 9, 2021, we elected to extend the date by which we are required to complete a business combination to May 21, 2021 and deposited $575,000 of the funds provided by Helbiz into our trust account.

Management Business Combination Experience
 
Our management team is led by Zhigeng (David) Fu, Qi (Karl) Ye, He (Herbert) Yu, Jonathan Intrater, and Lee Stern; each has distinctive and complementary backgrounds and extensive networks in the life science and healthcare industries, as well as other various industries in China, and other regions of Asia, Europe and North America which we believe can provide a rich selection of potential targets. We intend to focus on targeting middle market entities with a valuation range in the $100 million to $300 million range.
 
We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive business combination opportunities with compelling growth records and further potential. Members of our management team have extensive experience in executing business combinations, as they are long-term professionals as legal counsel to buyers and sellers in mergers and acquisitions, private equity investors or buy and sell side investment bankers. David Fu, our Chief Executive Officer, is an Of Counsel of Global Law Office, Shanghai, China. Mr. Fu has more than 25 years legal experience in foreign direct investment, mergers and acquisitions, private equity investment and restructuring of foreign-invested enterprises in China as well as outbound acquisitions and overseas securities offerings and listings by Chinese companies. Qi (Karl) Ye is a veteran investment manager in Shanghai, China. He has more than 13 years of broad experience in the financial industry, specializing in capital markets, mutual fund investment, private equity and venture capital investment, and has managed over $5 billion in assets under management. Professor Herbert Yu, one of the members of our Board of Directors has been director of The Cancer Epidemiology Program University of Hawaii Cancer Center since March 5, 2012. Professor He served as an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Full Professor at the School of Medicine at Yale University and has over 20 years involvement in leading edge cancer research including the areas of carcinogenic factors and molecular epidemiology. Mr. Intrater, another member of our Board, is a Managing Director in the investment banking department at United States’ based Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., Inc. and has extensive experience in merger advisory transactions.

Our management team continues to actively source target candidates where they believe will be attractive candidates for acquisition, utilizing their deal-making track record, professional relationships, and capital markets expertise to enhance the growth potential and value of a target business and provide opportunities for an attractive return to our stockholders.
 
BUSINESS STRATEGY
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our business combination with a company that meets one or more criteria of
 

● | being or having the potential to be disruptive in the life science or healthcare industry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | possessing a strong growth record;
--+-----------------------------------


● | significant potential for further growth;
--+------------------------------------------


● | a leading technology position or potential for such position; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | a proven management team prepared for being a public company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our selection process will leverage our management team’s broad and deep relationship network, industry experiences and deal sourcing capabilities to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities. Our management team has a distinctive combination of capabilities including:
 

● | analyzing performance, financial and otherwise, of existing public and private entities
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an extensive history of accessing the capital markets across various business cycles, including financing businesses and assisting companies with transition to public ownership.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our founders have, and will continue to communicate with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities. Our management team will also utilize the services of our investment banker, I-Bankers Securities, Inc. as well as other advisors.
 
Our objective is to generate an attractive return for stockholders through a merger with an industry leader with a strong growth record and growth potential. We expect to favor opportunities with certain industry and business characteristics such as compelling long-term growth prospects, attractive competitive dynamics, consolidation opportunities, leading technological position and strong management. We will also consider additional factors such as high barriers to entry, significant streams of recurring revenue, high incremental margins and attractive free cash flow characteristics.

ACQUISITION CRITERIA
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may ultimately decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire one or more companies or businesses that we believe:

● | have exhibited strong growth in revenue or profit in recent fiscal periods or have healthy cash flow from operations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will offer an attractive return for our stockholders, potential upside from growth in the target business and with an improved capital structure will provide a favorable upside reward metric measured against any identified downside risks; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | meet some key characteristics such as being or having the capability of being a disruptive participant within an industry, especially life sciences or the healthcare industries; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are capable of obtaining both organic and acquisitive growth; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are or can be positioned to enhance stockholder value and revenue growth as a result of increased presence across geographic borders; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | possess exploitable intellectual property. 
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. If we decide to enter into our business combination with a target business that does not meet all or some of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Form 10-K, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC and deliver to stockholders.
 
Past performance is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. Stockholders should not rely on the historical record of our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance.
 
OUR ACQUISITION PROCESS
 
In evaluating one or more prospective target business or businesses, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and key employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion and they may not be able to rely upon such opinion.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors own securities which will be worthless if we fail to complete a business combination and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.

We are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
EFFECTING A BUSINESS COMBINATION
 
We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. In the case of a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. In either case, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
Following the above-described extensions, we have until 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering (completed on November 21, 2019) to consummate an initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be $10.00 per share (regardless of whether or not the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option), without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure stockholders that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
 
NASDAQ rules require that our business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Although our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able independently to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. However, if NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange after our IPO, we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the balance in the trust account.

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 
Status as a public company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of common stock or for a combination of our shares of common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. We believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek stockholder approval of a business combination, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding rights, which may represent a source of future dilution.
 
Financial position
 
With funds in the trust account of $57,500,000 available to use for a business combination, not including the additional amounts deposited in connection with the two prior extensions, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. In connection with any potential acquisition, we may be required to obtain acquisition financing. However, since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us.
 
Management Expertise
 
We will seek to capitalize on the operating experience and contacts of our officers and directors in consummating an initial business combination. We believe the network and skills of these individuals make them valuable resources to our company and will assist us in consummating a transaction. Past performance of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination.
EFFECTING A BUSINESS COMBINATION
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time following our IPO (completed on November 21, 2019). We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of private warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination which has not yet been identified. Accordingly, investors in our IPO are investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense and potential loss of voting control, among others. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. We may determine to acquire more than one business or entity for our initial business combination, however, any such determination could tax our management and financial resources and adversely affect our time to complete a business combination.

In selecting a target business for a business combination, we are not required or bound to acquire a business in a particular geographic region or industry sector. However, we have focused our efforts in North America, Europe and Asia (excluding China), and in the life and health sciences sectors. We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China.
 
Subject to the requirement that while we are listed on NASDAQ our target business have a fair market value of 80% of the trust account balance (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account), as described below, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. Except as described below, we have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no basis for investors in our IPO to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete a business combination. To the extent we effect a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure stockholders that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
In our process of identifying an acquisition candidate, we believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous acquisition candidates. Our principal means of identifying potential target businesses have been through the extensive contacts and relationships of our founders, officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, we believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers will generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Form 10-K and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our founders, officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is), the repayment of non-interest-bearing loans and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers or directors or their affiliates. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
Subject to the limitations that while we are listed on NASDAQ a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (approximately $45,600,000) (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 

● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------

 
7

 


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
The target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (approximately $45,600,000) (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account). The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.
 
If NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange after our IPO, we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the balance in the trust account.

We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund-raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
We expect to complete only a single business combination. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we may need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our schedule, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. 
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure stockholders that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure stockholders that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure stockholders that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
9

 

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure stockholders that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. In the case of a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. In either case, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait up to 18 months from the closing of our IPO (November 21, 2019) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
Our founders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote their sponsor shares as well as any public shares acquired in or after our IPO in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, prior to a business combination, to affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem all public shares if it cannot complete an business combination within 12 months (or 15 or 18 months, as applicable) of the closing of this proposed offering, unless the Company provides public stockholders an opportunity to redeem their public shares, (3) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (4) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction we could need as few as 359,376 of our public shares (or approximately 6.25% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming only the minimum number of shares required to constitute a quorum are present at the stockholder meeting, the over-allotment option is not exercised and the founders do not purchase any units in our IPO or units or shares in the after-market).
 
None of our officers, directors, founders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock in our IPO or from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or to convert their shares, our officers, directors, founders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote or increase the likelihood of satisfying the necessary closing conditions to such transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, founders and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.

Conversion/Tender Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares. Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public stockholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.
 
Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our IPO or purchased by them in our IPO or in the aftermarket.
 
 We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.
 
Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination
 
Following the above-described extensions, if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of our IPO (completed on November 21, 2019), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period for two additional three-month periods to consummate a business combination. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC on November 18, 2020, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our founders or their affiliates or designees (which may include the potential target business), upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $575,000 ($0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. As previously reported, we have twice elected to extend the period within which we must complete a business combination by three months and have deposited an aggregate of $1,150,000 into the trust account in connection with such extensions. The providers of such additional funds may receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. Our founders have approved the issuance of the private warrants upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five (5) days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we do extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination as described above, we would follow the same liquidation procedures described above if we do not complete a business combination by the end of the extended period. At such time, the warrants will expire and holders of warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation and the warrants will be worthless.
 
There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants or rights, both of which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 12-month time period (or 15-month or 18-month time period, as applicable) from the closing of our IPO (November 21, 2019)). We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors).
 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we do not complete a business combination within the requisite time period, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 18th month from the closing of our IPO (November 21, 2019) and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
We seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after our IPO) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. The underwriters in our IPO will execute such a waiver agreement.
 
12

 

As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than approximately $10.00 (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) due to claims or potential claims of creditors. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.00 per share (whether or not the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. Our sponsor has been newly formed and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities or promissory notes of our company. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
 
We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below.
 
If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their insider shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account and from the interest income on the balance of the trust account (net income and other tax obligations) that may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $50,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00.
 
If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.

Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our IPO that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we hold a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to stockholder’s rights or pre-business combination activity (including the substance or timing within which we have to complete a business combination), we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in connection with any such vote. Our sponsor, officers and directors and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. have each agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any insider shares, private shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our certificate of incorporation includes several provisions which can impact our ability to consummate a business combination including, among other things, that:

● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 12 months of the closing of our IPO (or up to18 months from the closing of our IPO if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail elsewhere), then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account to all of our public holders of shares of common stock;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | upon the consummation of our IPO, $50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, was placed into the trust account;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also has certain provisions which can impact the ability of holders of our common stock to obtain conversion of their shares into funds held in trust. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, without our prior consent.
 
Potential Revisions to Agreements with Insiders
 
Each of our sponsor and officers and directors has entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which each of them has agreed to do certain things relating to us and our activities prior to a business combination. We could seek to amend these letter agreements without the approval of stockholders, although we have no intention to do so. In particular:

● | Restrictions relating to liquidating the trust account if we failed to consummate a business combination in the time-frames specified above could be amended, but only if we allowed all stockholders to redeem their shares in connection with such amendment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Restrictions relating to our insiders being required to vote in favor of a business combination or against any amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow our insiders to vote on a transaction as they wished;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14

 


● | The requirement of members of the management team to remain our officer or director until the closing of a business combination could be amended to allow persons to resign from their positions with us if, for example, the current management team was having difficulty locating a target business and another management team had a potential target business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The restrictions on transfer of our securities could be amended to allow transfer to third parties who were not members of our original management team;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The obligation of our management team to not propose amendments to our organizational documents could be amended to allow them to propose such changes to our stockholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The obligation of insiders to not receive any compensation in connection with a business combination could be modified in order to allow them to receive such compensation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The requirement to obtain a valuation for any target business affiliated with our insiders, in the event it was too expensive to do so.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Except as specified above, stockholders would not be required to be given the opportunity to redeem their shares in connection with such changes. Such changes could result in:
 

● | Our having an extended period of time to consummate a business combination (although with less in trust as a certain number of our stockholders would likely redeem their shares in connection with any such extension);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our insiders being able to vote against a business combination or in favor of changes to our organizational documents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our operations being controlled by a new management team that our stockholders did not elect to invest with;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our insiders receiving compensation in connection with a business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our insiders closing a transaction with one of their affiliates without receiving an independent valuation of such business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will not agree to any such changes unless we believed that such changes were in the best interests of our stockholders (for example, if we believed such a modification were necessary to complete a business combination). Each of our officers and directors have fiduciary obligations to us requiring that they act in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.
 
COMPETITION
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay the underwriters the business combination marketing fee upon consummation of our initial business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure stockholders that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
We currently have two executive officers, David Fu as our Chief Executive Officer and Karl Ye as our Chief Financial Officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
