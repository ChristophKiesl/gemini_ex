Overview
​
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the United States, Europe and additional international markets. We target our development programs for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develop, with partners, for those indications that require them, diagnostic tools intended to direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.
​
Our marketed product Rubraca® (rucaparib), an oral small molecule inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (“PARP”), is marketed in the United States for two indications specific to recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer and also an indication specific to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”). The initial indication received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2016 and covers the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA (human genes associated with the repair of damaged DNA) mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved

companion diagnostic for Rubraca. In April 2018, the FDA also approved Rubraca for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The approval in this second, broader and earlier-line indication on a priority review timeline was based on positive data from the phase 3 ARIEL3 clinical trial. Diagnostic testing is not required for patients to be prescribed Rubraca in this maintenance treatment indication.
​
In May 2020, the FDA approved Rubraca for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC associated with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy. The FDA approved this third indication under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response data from the TRITON2 clinical trial. We launched Rubraca for this indication in the U.S. following receipt of the approval. As an accelerated approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The TRITON3 clinical trial is expected to serve as the confirmatory study for Rubraca’s approval in mCRPC. In August 2020, the FDA approved the use of Foundation Medicine’s blood-based diagnostic test, FoundationOne Liquid CDx, as a companion diagnostic for the detection of deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) to select mCRPC patients for treatment with Rubraca.
​
In Europe, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization in May 2018 for Rubraca as monotherapy treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed or progressive, BRCA mutated (germline and/or somatic), high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who have been treated with two or more prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy, and who are unable to tolerate further platinum-based chemotherapy. In January 2019, the European Commission granted a variation to the marketing authorization to include the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. With this approval, Rubraca is authorized in Europe for certain patients in the recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance setting regardless of their BRCA mutation status. Following successful reimbursement negotiations, Rubraca has been launched in each of Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, and reimbursement is pending in Switzerland.
​
In December 2020, Rubraca met the primary study endpoint of significantly improving progression-free survival (“PFS”) versus chemotherapy in the ARIEL4 confirmatory study. An interim analysis of overall survival, a secondary endpoint in the study in which 51% of events had occurred in the intent-to-treat population, showed a trend toward an overall survival advantage in the chemotherapy arm, but was confounded by the high rate (64%) of per-protocol crossover to Rubraca following progression on chemotherapy. Additional ARIEL4 study results are expected to be submitted for presentation at a medical congress meeting in 2021. ARIEL4 is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized study of Rubraca versus chemotherapy, which enrolled relapsed ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations (inclusive of germline and/or somatic) who had received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Completion of ARIEL4 is a post-marketing commitment in the U.S. and Europe.
 ​
Beyond our labeled indications, we have a clinical development program underway to further evaluate Rubraca in a variety of solid tumor types, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents, including several studies as part of our ongoing clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“Bristol Myers Squibb”) to evaluate its immunotherapy Opdivo® (nivolumab) in combination with Rubraca. We anticipate initial data of Rubraca monotherapy versus placebo from our ATHENA study in the second half of 2021, with the results of Rubraca versus Opdivo in all study populations a year or more later. However, the timing of the ATHENA data readouts is dependent on the timing of data maturity driven by PFS events.
​
We initiated the Phase 2 LODESTAR study in December 2019 to evaluate Rubraca as monotherapy treatment in patients with recurrent solid tumors associated with a deleterious mutation in homologous recombination repair genes. Based on our interactions with the FDA, we believe that this study may be registration-enabling for a targeted gene- and tumor-agnostic label, if data from the trial support the potential for an accelerated approval. Assuming enrollment in this study continues as planned, and subject to the data, we may potentially file a supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) with the FDA for this indication in the second half of 2021 or the first half of 2022. 
​
We hold worldwide rights to Rubraca.
​
Pursuant to our license and collaboration agreement with 3B Pharmaceuticals GmbH (“3BP”), entered into in September 2019, we have initiated development of a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (“PTRT”) and imaging agent 

4




targeting fibroblast-activating protein (“FAP”). We have completed sufficient preclinical work to support an investigational new drug application (“IND”) for the lead candidate under our license and collaboration agreement, designated internally as FAP-2286. Accordingly, we submitted two INDs for FAP-2286 for use as imaging and treatment agents in December 2020 to support an initial Phase 1 study to determine the dose and tolerability of FAP-2286 as a therapeutic agent with expansion cohorts planned in multiple tumor types as part of a global development program. The INDs are expected to become effective following receipt and submission, and acceptance by the FDA, of satisfactory chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) data for the imaging agent from clinical sites. The FAP-targeting imaging agent will be utilized to identify tumors that contain FAP for treatment in the Phase 1 LuMIERE clinical study, which we anticipate initiating in the first half of 2021. 
​
In addition to our planned studies, the University of California San Francisco is sponsoring a separate, investigator-initiated, imaging-only study with gallium-68 labeled FAP-2286 (NCT04621435) to evaluate FAP expression in multiple tumor types; their study is currently recruiting. We hold U.S. and global rights to FAP-2286, excluding Europe (defined to include Russia, Turkey and Israel), where 3BP retains rights. We are also collaborating with 3BP on a discovery program directed to up to three additional, undisclosed targets for targeted radionuclide therapy, to which we would obtain global rights for any resulting product candidates.
​
Lucitanib, our second product candidate currently in clinical development, is an investigational, oral, potent angiogenesis inhibitor which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“VEGFR1-3”), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (“PDGFR α/β”) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“FGFR1-3”). Lucitanib inhibits the same three pathways as Lenvima® (lenvatinib), which has received an FDA approval for use in endometrial cancer in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), a PD-1 inhibitor. This, together with preclinical data for lucitanib in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor that demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to that of single agents, represent a scientific rationale for development of lucitanib in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, and in February 2019, lucitanib was added to our clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb. The Clovis-sponsored LIO-1 study of lucitanib in combination with nivolumab in advanced solid tumors and gynecologic cancers is currently enrolling patients in the Phase 2 part of the study. We expect to present interim data from this study at medical meetings in 2021, which are expected to include interim results from the ovarian and endometrial cancer expansion cohorts. We hold the global (excluding China) development and commercialization rights for lucitanib.
​
Clovis was founded in 2009. We have built our organization to support innovative oncology drug development for the treatment of specific subsets of cancer populations. To implement our strategy, we have assembled an experienced team with core competencies in global clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory operations and commercialization in oncology, as well as establishing collaborative relationships with companies specializing in companion diagnostic development.
​
Clinical Development Pipeline
​
We continue to evaluate the use of Rubraca for selected patient populations and, where appropriate, collaborate with partners for companion diagnostic development. We have focused our development strategy for Rubraca on indications where we believe patient populations exhibit higher frequencies of mutant BRCA tumors or tumors with other homologous recombination deficiencies (“HRD”), where PARP inhibitors have demonstrated clinical or pre-clinical activity in tumors. We are also developing lucitanib in combinations, including with Rubraca, based on encouraging data in clinical studies of other similar oncology compounds. FAP-2286 is currently the subject of IND-enabling preclinical studies and we submitted two INDs in December 2020. The following table summarizes the principal ongoing or planned Clovis- or collaborator-sponsored studies:

​
In certain of these trials, we or our collaborators may have access to interim data on a periodic or continuing basis that will not be made available publicly on the same timeframe as such data becomes available to us, or at all.
​
Rubraca – a PARP Inhibitor
​
Overview
​
Rubraca is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3. We in-licensed Rubraca from Pfizer, Inc. in June 2011 and hold exclusive worldwide rights. Rubraca has received regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. Rubraca also received regulatory approval in the United States as a monotherapy treatment of adult patients with BRCA1/2-mutant recurrent, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
​
In the United States, Rubraca is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic)-associated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and selected for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca. BRCA mutations are believed to occur in approximately 25% of women with ovarian cancer. In April 2018, the FDA granted a second approval for Rubraca for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy, a broader and earlier-line indication. Diagnostic testing is not required for patients to be prescribed Rubraca in this maintenance treatment indication.
​
In the United States, Rubraca is approved for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC associated with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy. The FDA approved this indication in May 2020 under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response data from the TRITON2 clinical trial. We launched Rubraca for this indication in the U.S. following receipt of the approval. As an accelerated approval, continued approval 

6




for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The TRITON3 clinical trial is expected to serve as the confirmatory study for Rubraca’s approval in mCRPC. In August 2020, the FDA approved the use of Foundation Medicine’s blood-based diagnostic test, FoundationOne Liquid CDx, as a companion diagnostic for the detection of deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) to select mCRPC patients for treatment with Rubraca.
​
In Europe, Rubraca is authorized for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of their BRCA mutation status. Following successful reimbursement negotiations, Rubraca has been launched in each of Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands, and reimbursement is pending in Switzerland.
​
The Role of PARP Inhibition in Cancer Therapy
​
Cells in the human body are under constant attack from agents that can cause damage to DNA, including sunlight and other forms of radiation, as well as DNA-binding chemicals that can cause changes in the composition of DNA. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to enable such DNA repair, and these mechanisms are complementary to each other, each driving repair of specific types of DNA damage. If a cell’s DNA damage repair system is overwhelmed, then the cell will die undergoing a form of suicide termed apoptosis. A fundamental principle of cancer therapy is to damage cells profoundly with radiation or DNA-binding drugs, such as alkylating agents or platinums, to induce apoptosis, and thus cancer cell death. Multiple DNA repair mechanisms active in the cell may reduce the activity of these anti-cancer therapies.
​
The PARP family comprises 17 structurally related proteins that have been identified on the basis of sequence similarity. PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3 play a central role in DNA repair. They are rapidly recruited to the sites of DNA damage and catalyze the recruitment of additional proteins that initiate the repair of damaged DNA. The breast cancer 1 (“BRCA1”) and breast cancer 2 (“BRCA2”) genes also have important roles in DNA repair pathways such as homologous recombination. According to the National Cancer Institute, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with an increased risk of ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.
 ​
Rubraca is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, including PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3. PARP inhibitors have shown activity in BRCA1/2 mutant and homologous recombination (“HR”) repair deficient cancer cell lines through a mechanism known as synthetic lethality in which the loss of two genes/pathways is required for cell death. The inhibition/inactivation of repair pathways by administration of a PARP inhibitor in the context of an underlying genetic defect such as a BRCA mutation results in tumor cell death through accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. 
​
Alterations in DNA repair genes other than BRCA1/2 have been observed in, and contribute to the hereditary risk of, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. PARP inhibitors have shown evidence of nonclinical and clinical activity in tumors with alterations in non-BRCA HR genes. DNA repair deficiencies resulting from genetic and epigenetic alterations can result in a “BRCA-like” phenotype that may also render tumor cells sensitive to PARP inhibitors. One approach to identify patients with DNA repair deficiencies due to mechanisms other than a mutation in BRCA or other non-BRCA HR genes is to assess loss of heterozygosity (“LOH”), or the loss of one normal copy of a gene, which arises from error-prone DNA repair pathways when HR is compromised. 
​
On the basis of these scientific observations, we initially developed Rubraca in ovarian cancer patients with tumors having BRCA mutations or other HRD. These molecular markers also may be used to select patients with other tumors for treatment with Rubraca. Thus, in addition to ovarian trials, studies open for enrollment or under consideration to further evaluate Rubraca, either alone or in combination with other agents, include prostate, breast, pancreatic, bladder and gastroesophageal cancers.
​
Ovarian cancer
​
According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated more than 21,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the United States and there will be an estimated nearly 14,000 deaths from ovarian cancer in 2021, and according to GLOBOCAN in 2020, an estimated 66,000 women in Europe are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer, and ovarian cancer is among those cancers with the highest rate of deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 75% of women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer at an advanced stage, and patients who are diagnosed with 

7




advanced ovarian cancer have a 70-95% chance of recurrence according to the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance. According to a Clinical Cancer Research 2010 publication, up to 60% of patients with ovarian cancer may be HR-deficient.
​
Rubraca’s approvals in the U.S. and Europe in the recurrent BRCA mutant ovarian cancer treatment setting were based on data from two multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trials, Study 10 (NCT01482715) and ARIEL2 (NCT01891344), in women with advanced BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer who had progressed after two or more prior chemotherapies. All patients received Rubraca orally 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy outcome measure of both studies was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”) version 1.1. Results from a blinded independent radiology review (“BICR”) were consistent.
​
The efficacy of Rubraca in the ovarian cancer maintenance treatment setting was investigated in ARIEL3 (NCT01968213), a double-blind, multicenter clinical trial in which 564 patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were in response to platinum-based chemotherapy were randomized (2:1) to receive Rubraca tablets 600 mg orally twice daily (n=375) or placebo (n=189). Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients had achieved a response (complete or partial) to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by best response to last platinum (complete or partial), time to progression following the penultimate platinum therapy (6 to < 12 months and ≥ 12 months), and tumor biomarker status. The major efficacy outcome was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECISTv1.1. 
​
The primary efficacy analysis evaluated three prospectively defined molecular sub-groups in a step-down manner: 1) tumor BRCA mutant (“tBRCAmut”) patients, inclusive of germline and somatic BRCA mutations (n=196); 2) HRD patients, including tBRCAmut patients and BRCA wild-type with high LOH (n=354), and, finally, 3) the intent-to-treat population, or all patients treated in ARIEL3 (n=564). ARIEL3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to Rubraca as compared with placebo in all patients, and in the HRD and tBRCAmut subgroups. Median PFS in the tBRCAmut patients was 16.6 months (95% CI: 13.4–22.9) in the Rubraca group (n=130) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.4–6.7) in the placebo group (n=66) (Hazard Ratio, or HR: 0.23 [95% CI: 0.16–0.34]; p<0.0001). Median PFS in the HRD patients was 13.6 months (95% CI: 10.9–16.2) in the Rubraca group (n=236) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 5.1–5.6) in the placebo group (n=118) (HR: 0.32 [95% CI: 0.24–0.42]; p<0·0001). Median PFS in the intent-to-treat population was 10.8 months (95% CI: 8.3–11.4) in the Rubraca group (n=375) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 5.3–5.5) in the placebo group (n=189) (HR: 0.36 [95% CI: 0.30–0.45]; p<0·0001). An exploratory analysis in the HRD/BRCA wild-type population demonstrated a median PFS of 9.7 months (95% CI: 7.9–13.1) in the Rubraca group (n=106) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.1–5.7) in the placebo group (n=52) (HR: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.29–0.66]); p<0.0001).
​
BICR results were consistent. In a pre-specified analysis of the key stand-alone secondary endpoint of progression-free survival assessed by BICR, PFS was also improved in the Rubraca group compared with placebo in all three populations. Median PFS in the tBRCAmut patients was 26.8 months (95% CI: 19.2 to not reached) in the Rubraca group versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.9–8.1) in the placebo group (HR: 0.20 [95% CI: 0.13–0.32]; p<0.0001). Median PFS in the HRD patients was 22.9 months (95% CI: 16.2 to not reported) in the Rubraca group versus 5.5 months (95% CI: 5.1–7.4) in the placebo group (HR: 0.34 [95% CI: 0.24–0.47]; p<0.0001). Median PFS in the intent-to-treat population was 13.7 months (95% CI: 11.0–19.1) versus 5.4 months (95% CI: 5.1–5.5) in the placebo group (HR: 0.35 [0.28–0.45]; p<0.0001). An exploratory analysis in the HRD/BRCA wild-type population demonstrated a median PFS of 11.1 months (95% CI: 8.2-NR) in the Rubraca group (n=106) versus 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.9–8.2) in the placebo group (n=52) (HR: 0.55 [95% CI: 0.35–0.89]; p=0.0135).
​
Enrollment in ARIEL3 included one-third of patients who had achieved a complete response to their prior platinum-based therapy, and two-thirds of patients who had achieved a partial response to their prior platinum-based therapy. Of those with a partial response, 37% had measurable disease at the time of enrollment and were therefore evaluable for response. The confirmed overall response rate by investigator-assessed RECISTv1.1 in the tBRCAmut group treated with Rubraca was 37.5% (15/40), of these, 17.5% (7/40) were complete responses. This compared with 9% (2/23) in the placebo group (p=0.0055). No complete responses were seen in the tBRCAmut placebo group. RECIST responses were also observed in BRCA wild-type HRD-positive and BRCA wild-type HRD-negative subgroups. In a subsequent post hoc exploratory analysis of ARIEL3 data, a higher response rate was also seen in patients without measurable disease in both the tBRCAmut group and the intent to treat population (inclusive of BRCAmut patients) as compared to placebo. RECIST responses were not assessed by independent blinded review.

​
Safety data from ARIEL3 demonstrated consistency with prior Rubraca studies. Treatment emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) in the ARIEL3 Rubraca group were generally managed with dose modifications and not associated with increased mortality or morbidity compared with the placebo group. The most common (occurring in ≥5% of patients) TEAEs of grade ≥3 reported in patients treated with Rubraca in the ARIEL3 study were anemia/decreased hemoglobin (21%), increase in ALT/AST (10%), neutropenia (7%), asthenia/fatigue (7%) and thrombocytopenia (5%). The discontinuation rate for TEAEs (excluding disease progression) was 15% for Rubraca-treated patients and 2% for the placebo arm. In ARIEL3, the rate of treatment-emergent myelodysplastic syndrome (“MDS”)/acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) in the Rubraca arm was <1% (3/372), and no patients on the placebo arm experienced treatment-emergent MDS/AML. In approximately 1,100 patients treated with Rubraca, MDS/AML occurred in 10 patients (0.9%), including those in long term follow-up. Of these, 5 occurred during treatment or during the 28-day safety follow-up (0.5%). The duration of Rubraca treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged from 1 month to approximately 28 months. The cases were typical of secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML; in all cases, patients had received previous platinum containing chemotherapy regimens and/or other DNA damaging agents.
​
At the time of the analysis of PFS, overall survival (OS) data were not mature (with 22% of events). The comprehensive dataset for ARIEL3 was presented at the 2017 European Society of Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress in early September 2017 and subsequently published in The Lancet. The ARIEL3 dataset formed the basis for sNDA filed with the FDA as well as the marketing authorization variation filed with the EMA supporting the approval of Rubraca in the US in April 2018 and Europe in January 2019 respectively, as maintenance treatment in adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
​
The ARIEL4 confirmatory study (NCT 02855944) is a Phase 3 multicenter, randomized study of Rubraca versus chemotherapy, which enrolled relapsed ovarian cancer patients with BRCA mutations (inclusive of germline and/or somatic) who had received two or more prior lines of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study is investigator-assessed progression-free survival (“InvPFS”), with a step-down analysis from the efficacy population (if significant) to the intent to treat (“ITT”) population. The efficacy population comprised the group of patients with a deleterious tumor BRCA mutation and excluded those with a BRCA reversion mutation as determined by a blood test. Development of reversion mutations that restore BRCA protein function are associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapies and PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutant cancers, and these occur more frequently in platinum-resistant vs platinum-sensitive patients (13% and 2% respectively in the ARIEL2 study). In December 2020, Rubraca met the primary study endpoint of significantly improving InvPFS versus chemotherapy. Patients with a BRCA reversion mutation represented 7% of patients enrolled in the study and as anticipated, InvPFS results for those patients showed limited benefit from Rubraca therapy. An interim analysis of overall survival, a secondary endpoint in the study in which 51% of events had occurred in the intent-to-treat population, showed a trend toward an overall survival advantage in the chemotherapy arm, but was confounded by the high rate (64%) of per-protocol crossover to Rubraca following progression on chemotherapy. An analysis of the ITT population of patients showed a trend toward an OS advantage for those patients who received Rubraca at any point in the trial versus those who did not. Additional ARIEL4 study results are expected to be submitted for presentation at a medical congress meeting in 2021. Completion of ARIEL4 is a post-marketing commitment in the U.S. and Europe. 
​
Prostate cancer
​
The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 248,000 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2021, and the GLOBOCAN Cancer Fact Sheets estimated that approximately 473,000 men in Europe were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020. Castrate-resistant prostate cancer has a high likelihood of developing metastases. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”) is an incurable disease, usually associated with poor prognosis. Approximately 43,000 men in the U.S. are expected to be diagnosed with mCRPC in 2020. According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for mCRPC is approximately 30%. A number of publications have reported germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are approximately 12% in mCRPC according to an article published in JCO Precision Oncology in 2017. These molecular markers may be used to select patients for treatment with a PARP inhibitor. 
​
The TRITON (Trial of Rucaparib in Prostate Indications) program in prostate cancer initiated in the second half of 2016, and currently includes two Clovis-sponsored studies. Enrollment is complete for TRITON2; TRITON3 continues to enroll patients.

​
The TRITON2 study (NCT02952534) is a multicenter Phase 2 single-arm study of Rubraca in men with mCRPC that enrolled patients with BRCA mutations (inclusive of germline and/or somatic) or other deleterious mutations in other homologous recombination repair genes. Patients in the TRITON2 study have received prior treatment with at least one androgen receptor (“AR”)-directed therapy and one previous line of taxane-based chemotherapy and were screened for a deleterious germline or somatic mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2 or one of 13 other pre-specified homologous recombination (“HR”) genes. Study participants were allocated into three cohorts based on the type of gene mutation and disease status, as determined by genomic sequencing and RECIST criteria, respectively. Each cohort receives 600 mg Rubraca twice daily and are grouped based on the following criteria: A) mutation in either BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM genes, with tumors that can be measured with visceral and/or nodal disease; B) mutation in either BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM genes, with tumors that cannot be measured with visceral and/or nodal disease, or C) mutation in another HR gene associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibition, with or without measurable disease. The primary study endpoints include confirmed ORR and duration of response (“DOR”) per modified RECIST v.1.1/PCWG3 criteria assessed by BICR in patients with measurable disease at baseline by independent review and PSA response in patients with no measurable disease at baseline. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (“OS”), clinical benefit rate, and safety and tolerability.
​
Efficacy and safety data from TRITON2 formed the basis of a sNDA that was submitted to FDA in late 2019. Evaluable patient populations in the sNDA dataset included the following: 62 RECIST-evaluable patients with a BRCA (germline and/or somatic) mutation and measurable disease (BICR); 115 patients with a BRCA (germline and/or somatic) mutation and measurable or non-measurable disease; and 209 patients with HRD-positive mCRPC. The RECIST-evaluable patient population demonstrated a 44% ORR (N=62; 95% CI 31, 57) by BICR. Objective response rates were similar for patients with a germline BRCA versus somatic BRCA mutation. Median DOR was not evaluable at data cut-off. Additionally, a 55% confirmed PSA response rate (95% CI 45, 64) was observed in an analysis of 115 patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) and measurable or non-measurable disease.
​
TRITON2 evaluated the safety of Rubraca 600 mg twice daily as monotherapy treatment in the 209 patients with HRD-positive mCRPC enrolled in the study, including the 115 with BRCA-mutated mCRPC. The most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20% of patients; CTCAE Grade 1-4) occurring in the BRCA mutant population (n=115) were asthenia/fatigue, nausea, anemia, ALT/AST increased, decreased appetite, constipation, rash, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (greater than or equal to 35% of patients; CTCAE Grade 1-4) were increase in ALT, decrease in leukocytes, decrease in phosphate, decrease in absolute neutrophil count, decrease in hemoglobin, increase in alkaline phosphatase, increase in creatinine, increase in triglycerides, decrease in lymphocytes, decrease in platelets, and decrease in sodium.
​
In May 2020, the FDA approved Rubraca for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC associated with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) who have been treated previously with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy. The FDA approved this indication under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of response data from the TRITON2 clinical trial. We launched Rubraca for this indication in the U.S. following receipt of the approval. As an accelerated approval, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. The TRITON3 clinical trial is expected to serve as the confirmatory study for Rubraca’s approval in mCRPC. In August 2020, the FDA approved the use of Foundation Medicine’s blood-based diagnostic test, FoundationOne Liquid CDx, as a companion diagnostic for the detection of deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) to select mCRPC patients for treatment with Rubraca.
​
The TRITON3 study (NCT02975934) is a Phase 3 comparative study in men with mCRPC enrolling BRCA mutant and ATM (both inclusive of germline and/or somatic) patients who have progressed on AR-targeted therapy and who have not yet received chemotherapy in the castrate-resistant setting. TRITON3 will compare Rubraca to physician’s choice of AR-targeted therapy or chemotherapy in these patients. The planned primary endpoint of the study is radiologic PFS. TRITON3 initiated during the first quarter of 2017.
​
The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology is sponsoring the Phase 3 CASPAR study (NCT04455750) comparing the combination of enzalutamide and Rubraca to enzalutamide alone in mCRPC. The study is expected to enroll approximately 1,000 patients in the United States at National Clinical Trials Network (“NCTN”) sites nationally and is currently the only study evaluating the combination of a PARP inhibitor and a novel anti-androgen with an overall survival endpoint. The Alliance is part of the NCTN sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. CASPAR is expected to begin enrolling patients in the near-term.

LODESTAR tumor-agnostic study 
​
The LODESTAR clinical study (NCT04171700) is a Phase 2 study evaluating Rubraca as monotherapy treatment in patients with recurrent solid tumors associated with a deleterious homologous recombination repair (“HRR”) gene mutation across a variety of tumor types. These gene mutations include BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D in the primary cohort, as well as several additional genes in an exploratory cohort. We anticipate that this study may potentially be registration-enabling for a targeted gene- and tumor-agnostic label. The study initiated in late 2019 and is currently enrolling. 
​
Opdivo combination trials
Our ongoing collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb involves the evaluation of the combination of Rubraca with Bristol Myers Squibb’s immunotherapy Opdivo® (nivolumab) in multiple tumor types.
We believe that a preclinical rationale supports the conduct of clinical trials of the combination of our PARP inhibitor Rubraca with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as the PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo. BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other HRD mutations are associated with increased tumor mutational burden, which may create additional tumor-specific antigens or “neoepitopes.” Increased tumor mutation burden has been shown to correlate with increased benefit from immune checkpoint blockade. In addition, cell death that is induced by a PARP inhibitor is considered immunogenic and stimulates a “STING-like” pathway due to fragmented DNA release into cytosol. In mice studies, rucaparib and an anti-PD-1 antibody demonstrated anti-tumor activity in BRCA1 mutant ovarian tumors. The combination of rucaparib and either an anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody were equally compelling in preclinical studies.
Three combination trials of Rubraca and Opdivo are currently underway sponsored by Clovis or Bristol Myers Squibb, and in February 2019, lucitanib was added to the clinical collaboration in combinations with Opdivo.
ATHENA is the Clovis-sponsored four-arm first-line maintenance treatment study (NCT03522246) to evaluate Rubraca and Opdivo, Rubraca, Opdivo and placebo in approximately 1,000 newly diagnosed patients with stage III/IV high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who have completed platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary objectives are first, to determine if Rubraca extends PFS versus placebo, and second, to determine if the combination of Rubraca and Opdivo meaningfully extends PFS versus Rubraca monotherapy, or versus placebo. The ATHENA study, which initiated in 2018 and completed enrollment in the second quarter of 2020, evaluates Rubraca in terms of two key outcomes in a step-down manner: monotherapy versus placebo in the first-line maintenance setting in the HRD population, inclusive of BRCA, and in the all comers (intent-to-treat) population, and later, any potential advantage for the combination of Rubraca and Opdivo in the same patient populations. ATHENA is the first front-line switch maintenance study to evaluate a PARP inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 in one study design. We anticipate the results of the Rubraca monotherapy arm versus placebo in all study populations in the second half of 2021, and then a year or more later, the results of Rubraca plus Opdivo versus Rubraca in all study populations. However, the timing of the ATHENA readouts is dependent on the timing of data maturity driven by PFS events. Each of the analyses will first evaluate outcomes in the HRD population, inclusive of BRCA, and then step down to the entire intent-to-treat population.
Bristol Myers Squibb is sponsoring CheckMate 9KD (NCT03338790), a Phase 2 three-arm study in mCRPC, evaluating Opdivo + Rubraca, Opdivo + docetaxel + prednisone, and Opdivo + enzalutamide, with the objective of determining how the combinations affects objective response rate and PSA response. The study has completed enrollment of patients with biomarker negative or positive disease, for whom tumor tissue samples were used to determine biomarker status. Bristol Myers Squibb initiated the study in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Bristol Myers Squibb is also sponsoring FRACTION-GC (NCT02935634), a Phase 2 multi-arm study evaluating Opdivo in combination with other therapies in advanced gastric cancer. The trial includes, among other combinations, an evaluation of Opdivo + Rubraca, Yervoy + Rubraca and the triplet combination of Opdivo + Yervoy + Rubraca. This is the first sponsored study to explore this triplet combination, and it is now enrolling patients into the safety lead-in part of the Rubraca-containing portion of the study.

Pancreatic cancer
​
Interim results from an investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial of Rubraca as first-line maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive patients with advanced pancreatic cancer reported at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) annual meeting in April 2019 suggest that first-line maintenance therapy with Rubraca following induction with platinum-based chemotherapy provides disease control with no new safety signals among patients with a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2. Based on these data as well as the earlier Clovis-sponsored RUCAPANC study, we plan to enroll patients with pancreatic cancer and selected genetic mutations in the LODESTAR pan-tumor study of rucaparib that initiated in late 2019.
​
Bladder cancer
​
In April 2019, we discontinued our Clovis-sponsored ATLAS Phase 2 open-label monotherapy clinical trial evaluating rucaparib in recurrent, metastatic bladder cancer. The decision was based on recommendations by an independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) following its review of preliminary efficacy data for 62 patients enrolled and treated in the study, which demonstrated that the objective response rate in the intent-to-treat population did not meet the protocol-defined continuance criteria, and suggested that monotherapy treatment may not provide a meaningful clinical benefit in the all-comer patient population enrolled in the trial. Following the DMC’s recommendation to stop enrollment in the study, we terminated the ATLAS study early. We plan to enroll patients with advanced bladder cancer and selected genetic mutations in the LODESTAR pan-tumor study of rucaparib that initiated in late 2019. 
​
Companion Diagnostics
​
Three FDA-approved companion diagnostic tests are commercially available to select cancer patients for treatment with Rubraca. 
​

​
FAP-2286 and Radionuclide Therapy Development Program
​
FAP-2286 is a preclinical candidate discovered by 3BP under investigation as a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (“PTRT”) and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein alpha (“FAP”). In September 2019, we acquired U.S. and global rights to FAP-2286, excluding Europe (inclusive of Russia, Turkey and Israel), where 3BP retains rights. We are also collaborating with 3BP on a discovery program directed to up to three additional, undisclosed targets for targeted radionuclide therapy, to which we would obtain global rights for any resulting product candidates.
​
Patent applications are pending that claim FAP-2286 generically and specifically (including with respect to composition of matter) that, if issued, would have expiration dates in 2040. 
​
The Role of Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha as a Radiopharmaceutical Target
​

12




FAP is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (“CAFs”) which are found in the majority of cancer types, potentially making it a suitable target across a wide array of solid tumors. FAP is highly expressed in many epithelial cancers, including more than 90% of breast, lung, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas. CAFs are highly prevalent in the tumor microenvironment of many cancers and persist through all malignant stages of a tumor, from primary tumor to metastasis. FAP has limited expression on normal fibroblasts, reducing the potential for effects in normal tissue.
​
PTRT is an emerging class of drugs and it involves the administration via intravenous injection of a small amount of radioactive material – a radionuclide – that is combined with a peptide for use as a targeted pharmaceutical. The peptide is able to recognize and bind to specific targets on the cancer cells or in their microenvironment, and the intended result is to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor while sparing normal tissue because of its rapid systemic clearance. Radionuclides with different emission properties, primarily beta particles or more potent alpha particles, are used to deliver cytotoxic radiation to the tumor-associated targets. In order for the targeted radiopharmaceutical to be safe and efficacious, it must rapidly attach to cancer cells or in close vicinity to the cancer cells, be retained in or at the tumor site for a sufficient period of time that the radionuclide can have activity on the cancer cells, have minimal attachment to non-cancer cells, and then be rapidly cleared from the body. In most cases, the radionuclides may be visualized by using nuclear medicine imaging techniques to evaluate the specificity of the agent, supporting a precision medicine approach to delivery of the therapeutic form of the agent.
​
Clinical studies of small molecule imaging agents targeting FAP have validated this target in a diverse number of cancer indications and support the further evaluation of peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals have at least two potential modes of anti-tumor activity: radiation crossfire, in which tumor cells are irradiated due to their close proximity to CAFs; and depletion of CAFs, disrupting the communication between the tumor cells and the tumor stroma. In addition, in certain tumor types, such as sarcoma and mesothelioma, FAP is expressed on the tumor cells themselves, and in those tumors, FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals may have a direct antitumor effect.
​
In addition, an evident biological rationale supports the combination of targeted radionuclide therapy with cancer therapies including PARP inhibitors and anti-PD(L)-1 agents. While our initial development focus will be on monotherapy with FAP-2286, we intend to explore these types of combinations pre-clinically and clinically as well.
​
The FAP-2286 product candidate consists of a peptide that selectively binds to FAP and a linker and site to which radioactive medical isotopes can be attached for use as an imaging agent or therapeutic agent. Our initial development plans include the use of gallium-68 (68Ga) as an imaging agent and lutetium-177 (177Lu) as a therapeutic agent.
​
The anti-tumor efficacy of 177Lu-FAP-2286 has been evaluated preclinically in FAP-expressing tumor models. Data presented at the 2020 ESMO Virtual Congress demonstrated that a single, IV dose of 177Lu-FAP-2286 resulted in statistically significant tumor growth inhibition in two different mouse xenograft models: (1) HEK293 cells stably transfected with human FAP (HEK-FAP); and (2) Sarc4809 sarcoma patient-derived xenograft model with endogenous FAP expression.
​
First Clinical Experience Reported from FAP-2286 Named Patient Use
​
Physicians in Germany and certain other countries may treat patients suffering from life-threatening diseases or disease leading to severe disability with experimental drugs if no other appropriate options are available under named-patient or similar programs. A physician may initiate treatment for specific patients until there is commercial product available and patients are encouraged to enroll in clinical trials where possible. Named patient programs are not clinical trials and the treating physician is solely responsible for, and makes all decisions independently, including dose and assessment of efficacy and safety, and the drug sponsor has no role in decisions.
​
In December 2019, Professor Dr. Richard P. Baum reported his initial independent clinical experience with FAP-2286 in named-patient use in eleven patients at the International Centers for Precision Oncology Foundation Symposium in Bad Berka, Germany. At Prof. Dr. Baum’s clinic, FAP-2286 was linked to gallium-68 as a tumor-imaging compound using PET/CT scanning and to lutetium-177 as a therapeutic agent. While we were not provided the data behind his results and have not verified those results, we were encouraged by his presentation, and believe that his reported experience supports our pre-clinical and development plans.
​

As the early named patient use in Germany suggests, significant interest already exists within the academic community to explore the potential of FAP as an imaging and treatment target.
​
Our FAP-2286 Clinical Development Plan
​
In December 2020, we submitted two INDs for FAP-2286 for use as imaging and treatment agents, respectively, to support an initial Phase 1 study, designated the LuMIERE study, to determine the dose and tolerability of 177Lu-FAP-2286 as a therapeutic agent. Expansion cohorts are planned in multiple tumor types as part of a global development program. The INDs are expected to become effective following receipt and submission of satisfactory CMC data for the gallium-68 labeled imaging agent from clinical sites. The FAP-targeting imaging agent will be utilized to identify tumors that contain FAP for treatment in the Phase 1 clinical study, which we anticipate initiating in the first half of 2021. Studies of FAP-2286 linked to an alpha-emitter are also under consideration. 
​
In addition to our planned study, the University of California San Francisco is sponsoring a separate, investigator-initiated imaging-only study with gallium-68 labelled FAP-2286 to evaluate FAP expression in multiple tumor types (NCT04621435); this study is enrolling patients. Data from the study is expected to inform indication selection for the LuMIERE Phase 2 expansion cohorts.
​
Lucitanib – a VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR Inhibitor
​
Lucitanib is an investigational, oral, potent angiogenesis inhibitor which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“VEGFR1-3”), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (“PDGFR α/β”) and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 3 (“FGFR1-3”).
​
The composition of matter patent for lucitanib expires in 2030 in the U.S. and 2028 in Europe, with up to five years patent term extension available. We hold the global (excluding China) development and commercialization rights for lucitanib.
​
VEGF, PDGF and FGF: The Role of these Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Cancer
​
The VEGFs are a family of related extracellular proteins that normally regulate blood and lymphatic vessel development in humans. They act by binding to and activating VEGF receptors, which are cell surface proteins that transmit growth signals to specific cells that are involved in the development of new blood vessels. Certain VEGFs promote growth of multiple solid tumors by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels to feed the tumor and allow it to grow and metastasize. Tumors produce an excessive amount of VEGF. This results in excess VEGFR signaling and the formation of new blood vessels within the tumor. The VEGF ligands that induce angiogenesis are often present in a wide range of cancer indications, including a type of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma, a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, head and neck cancers and other solid tumors.
​
The PDGF family consists of five different isoforms of PDGF ligand that bind to and activate cellular responses through two different receptors (PDGFRα/ß). In tumors, PDGF signaling plays a diverse role in many aspects of tumor development promoting cell proliferation, invasion, migration and angiogenesis. Amplification and/or mutation of the gene encoding the PDGFRα receptor is observed in a wide range of cancers, including lung cancer, an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma and a cancer of the gastrointestinal tract known as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Amplification of the PDGFRα gene results in excess production, or the over-expression, of PDGFRα protein on the surface of the tumor cell. The over-expression of PDGFRα on the tumor cell surface leads to an increased receptor signaling, which stimulates uncontrolled proliferation of some types of tumor cells. 
​
The FGFs are a family of related extracellular proteins that normally regulate cell proliferation and survival in humans. The FGF family consists of 22 ligands that exert their physiological effect on cells by binding to four FGFRs (FGFR1- 4). As with the PDGF family, some cancers display FGF/FGFR gene amplification/mutation resulting in continual activation of the FGFR signaling pathway leading to uncontrolled cell division. Tumors with a relatively high incidence of FGF aberrations, which include amplification of the FGFR1 gene and amplification of a region of chromosome 11q that contains several FGF ligands, include breast and lung cancers. In addition, FGFR gene amplification/mutation is also observed in a wide range of cancer indications including sarcoma, ovarian cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer.

As an inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, PDGFRα/ß and FGFR1-3 and given the role that each of these receptor kinases plays in tumor progression and metastasis formation, lucitanib has the potential benefit of targeting three relevant pro-angiogenic growth factors in targeted patient populations identified by molecular markers. Data from earlier studies suggest that lucitanib’s VEGF inhibition may be the primary driver of its activity, and both preclinical and clinical data provide a scientific rationale for further development on lucitanib in combination with other agents. 
​
Targeting angiogenesis and immune checkpoint pathways may have a synergistic effect on antitumor activity. Angiogenesis has been shown to be immunosuppressive within the tumor microenvironment, dampening anti-tumor immune responses, according to Nature Reviews in Clinical Oncology (Fukumura 2018). Immune effects of angiogenesis include modulation of T-cell infiltration into the tumor, inhibition of dendritic cell maturation, and the modulation of cell adhesion molecules and immune cell populations. Inhibition of angiogenesis by small molecule RTK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies may reverse immunosuppression. These data suggest the clinical activity of PD-(L)1 inhibitors may be enhanced through the inhibition of angiogenesis by lucitanib. Clovis preclinical studies of multiple syngeneic tumor models have shown that lucitanib in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor delivers superior activity. Multiple Phase 1-3 studies are examining the combination of angiogenesis and PD-(L)1 inhibitors in different indications.
​
Lucitanib inhibits the same three pathways as Lenvima (lenvatinib), which has shown encouraging results when combined with the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), and this combination has been approved by the FDA on an accelerated basis for the treatment of certain forms of endometrial cancer. This, together with preclinical data for lucitanib in combination with a PD(L)-1 inhibitor as described above, represent a scientific rationale for development of lucitanib in combination with a PD(L)-1 inhibitor, and in February 2019, lucitanib was added to our clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb evaluating combinations with Opdivo. 
​
LIO-1 is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 study (NCT04042116) of lucitanib in combination with Opdivo in advanced gynecologic cancers and other solid tumors to determine the recommended dose of lucitanib in combination with Opdivo in patients with an advanced solid tumor (Phase 1b); followed by evaluation of the safety and efficacy of lucitanib and Opdivo in patients with an advanced gynecological solid tumor (Phase 2), including ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers. The primary efficacy endpoint of the LIO-1 study is ORR as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. 
​
Initial data presented at the 2020 ESMO Virtual Congress from the Phase 1b part of the study in patients with an advanced solid tumor (n=17) identified the recommended starting Phase 2 dose of oral lucitanib to be used in combination with Opdivo and showed promising signs of antitumor activity. The recommended oral starting dose of lucitanib was established as 6 mg once daily, to be given in combination with Opdivo at a fixed dose of 480 mg intravenously (IV) once every 28 days. Across three dose levels studied (6 mg, 8 mg and 10 mg) of lucitanib in combination with Opdivo at (480 mg once every 28 days), only one dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 proteinuria was observed among 17 patients, and there were no apparent differences in TEAE frequencies between dose levels. In this small patient population, TEAEs were consistent with those expected for lucitanib and Opdivo. The Phase 2 part of the study is currently enrolling. We expect to present interim data from LIO-1 at medical meetings in 2021, which are expected to include interim results from the ovarian and endometrial cancer expansion cohorts.
​
Preclinical and clinical data also support the potential activity of combining angiogenesis and PARP inhibition. According to Cancer Research and Molecular and Cellular Biology, there is a link between PARP inhibition and suppression of angiogenesis: chronic hypoxia induces down-regulation of BRCA1 and RAD51 and decreases homologous recombination in cancer cells. Clovis preclinical data in an ovarian tumor BRCA1mut syngeneic model showed the combination of lucitanib and rucaparib is more active than monotherapy than either lucitanib or rucaparib as a single agent and showed similar anti-tumor activity to rucaparib in combination with another oral VEGFR inhibitor. Published clinical data for the combination of another oral VEGFR inhibitor and PARP inhibitor in development further demonstrate the potential activity of the combination.
​
Competition
​
The development and commercialization of new drugs is intensely competitive, and we face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than 

15




any that have been or will be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
​
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. More established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies that take similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel as well as in establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials. 
​
Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further because of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.

​
Additional clinical investigations of Zejula in ovarian, breast prostate and lung cancers are ongoing or planned. Janssen Pharmaceuticals has licensed rights to develop and commercialize niraparib specifically for patients with prostate cancer worldwide, except in Japan. Preliminary results announced in February and September 2019 for Janssen’s Phase 2 GALAHAD study evaluating niraparib in patients with mCRPC and DNA-repair pathway defects showed that approximately 40% of patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation demonstrated a RECIST response. In October 2019, niraparib was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation based on data from the Phase 2 GALAHAD study.
​
TALZENNA™/talazoparib (Pfizer Inc.) is approved in the US and EU for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

There are several PARP inhibitors in clinical development including AbbVie Inc.’s veliparib and ABT-767, BeiGene, Ltd.’s pamiparib, Checkpoint Therapeutics Inc.’s CK-102, and Oncology Venture A/S’s 2X-121. While most PARP 

17




inhibitor development focuses on ovarian, breast and prostate cancers, additional efforts are aimed toward bladder, lung, and pancreatic cancers as well. 
​
In addition, combination approaches that include PARP inhibitors, including Lynparza and Zejula, with other anticancer agents are in various phases of clinical development across a variety of oncology indications. These combination therapies may result in future competitive pressure on Rubraca.

● | in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the front-line treatment of adult patients with advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages III B, III C and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel, for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens and who have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor–targeted agents.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Other out-of-class agents approved for use in advanced ovarian cancer include chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. platinum-based doublets, platinum monotherapy, non-platinum chemotherapy, etc.), Doxil® (Janssen Biotech, Inc.), and Hycamtin® (Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation). There are additional out-of-class agents in clinical development that may pose a future competitive threat to Rubraca.

Lucitanib Competition
​
Competitive threats to lucitanib include other inhibitors of VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR, but most significantly Eisai Inc.’s Lenvima/lenvatinib. Lenvima is approved for the following indications in the United States:


● | for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in combination with everolimus, for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in combination with Merck & Co., Inc.’s PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition, Eisai and Merck have established a strategic collaboration for the worldwide co-development and co-commercialization of Lenvima, and have a broad clinical program underway to evaluate Lenvima, alone and in combination with Keytruda, in a wide variety of tumor types.
​
FAP-2286 Competition
​
Competitive threats to our product candidate FAP-2286 include those that are currently approved and widely available or are established as standards of care for treatment indications that may be relevant for FAP-2286.
​
More generally, there is an increasing commitment of resources in the pharmaceutical industry to emerging areas such as antibody drug conjugate therapies and radio-labeled therapeutics and screening agents, which may in the future compete in the indications for which we choose to develop FAP-2286. For example, in June 2019, Sofie Biosciences licensed rights including small molecule inhibitors of FAP for imaging use from University Medical Centre Heidelberg. More recently, Point Biopharma has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Avacta to use their technology in the development of a range of FAP-activated radiopharmaceuticals.
​
In addition, other potential FAP-directed radionuclide therapeutics, small molecules, biologics, immunotherapies, and other treatment modalities that target FAP are at various stages of development. For example, AMG506 (also known as MP0310) is a multi-specific FAP x 4-1BB-targeting DARPin® biologic that is being developed by Amgen in collaboration with Molecular Partners, AG. AMG506 is being investigated in at least one clinical trial (NCT04049903 ) in patients with advanced solid tumors. 
​
Roche also has several compounds that are being investigated. RO6874281 is a targeted immunocytokine that combines an engineered interleukin-2 variant (IL2v) with an antibody against FAP. RO6874813 (RG7386), a bispecific antibody that binds to FAP and death receptor 5 (DR5), is being studied in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NCT02558140). 
​
PSIOxus Therapeutics is developing an oncolytic adenoviral vector (NG-641) designed to deliver genes to tumor cells that produce proteins targeting tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts. The NG-641 virus encodes genes for FAP-targeting bispecific T-cell activator (FAP-TAc), the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, and interferon alpha. NG-641 is being investigated in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT04053283).
​
Bioxcel Therapeutics is developing talabostat (BXCL701), a molecule that is designed to inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8/9 and block immune evasion by targeting FAP. BXCL is being investigated in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with aggressive prostate cancer (NCT03910660) and pancreatic cancer (NCT04123574).

19




​
In addition, radionuclide therapeutics with targets other than FAP may compete with FAP-2286 if they target the same tumor type. For example, in September 2017, Endocyte, Inc. licensed rights to develop and commercialize agents targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, including the drug candidate 177Lu-PSMA-617, a radioligand therapeutic, from ABX GmbH. Endocyte was acquired by Novartis in 2018, and 177Lu-PSMA-617 is currently in a phase 3 trial (NCT03511664) for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, other targeted radionuclide therapeutics are in earlier stage clinical development, including but not limited to 3BP-227 (Ipsen) which targets neurotensin receptor type 1, BAY2287411 (Bayer) which targets mesothelin, BAY2701439 (Bayer) which targets HER-2, and BAY 2315497 (Bayer) which targets PSMA.
​
Furthermore, universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, the results of which may result in direct competition with FAP-2286. For example, the German Center of Cancer Research and University Medical Center Heidelberg, the owners of the patent rights to PSMA 617 (which were licensed to ABX and, in turn, to Novartis), are continuing to engage in research relating to radioligand therapeutics.
​
License Agreements 
​
Pfizer Inc. 
​
In June 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) to obtain the exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize Rubraca. The exclusive rights are exclusive even as to Pfizer and include the right to grant sublicenses. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we made a $7.0 million upfront payment to Pfizer and are required to make additional payments to Pfizer for the achievement of certain development and regulatory and sales milestones and royalties on sales as required by the license agreement. Prior to the FDA approval of Rubraca, we made milestone payments of $1.4 million, which were recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense. 
​
On August 30, 2016, we entered into a first amendment to the worldwide license agreement with Pfizer, which amends the June 2011 existing worldwide license agreement to permit us to defer payment of the milestone payments payable upon (i) FDA approval of an NDA for 1st Indication in US and (ii) EMA approval of an MAA for 1st Indication in the EU, to a date that is 18 months after the date of achievement of such milestones.
​
On December 19, 2016, Rubraca received its initial FDA approval. This approval resulted in a $0.75 million milestone payment to Pfizer as required by the license agreement, which was paid in the first quarter of 2017. This FDA approval also resulted in an obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, for which we exercised the option to defer payment by agreeing to pay $23.0 million within 18 months after the date of the FDA approval. We paid the $23.0 million milestone payment in June 2018. 
​
In April 2018, Rubraca received a second FDA approval. This approval resulted in an obligation to pay a $15.0 million milestone payment, which we paid in April 2018.
​
In May 2018, Rubraca received its initial European Commission marketing authorization. This approval resulted in an obligation to pay a $20.0 million milestone payment, which we paid in June 2018.
​
In January 2019, Rubraca received a second European Commission approval. This approval resulted in an obligation to pay a $15.0 million milestone payment, which we paid in February 2019.
​
In June 2019, we paid a $0.75 million milestone payment due to the launch of Rubraca as maintenance therapy in Germany in March 2019.
​
In May 2020, Rubraca received a third FDA approval for Rubraca as a monotherapy treatment of adult patients with BRCA1/2-mutant recurrent, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. This approval resulted in an obligation to pay an $8.0 million milestone payment, which we paid in June 2020.
​
These milestone payments were recognized as intangible assets and are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of Rubraca.
​

20




We are obligated under the license agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Rubraca and we are responsible for all ongoing development and commercialization costs for Rubraca. We are required to make regulatory milestone payments to Pfizer of up to an additional $8.0 million in aggregate if specified clinical study objectives and regulatory filings, acceptances and approvals are achieved. In addition, we are obligated to make sales milestone payments to Pfizer if specified annual sales targets for Rubraca are met, which relate to annual sales targets of $250.0 million and above, which, in the aggregate, could amount to total milestone payments of $170.0 million, and tiered royalty payments at a mid-teen percentage rate on net sales, with standard provisions for royalty offsets to the extent we need to obtain any rights from third parties to commercialize Rubraca. 
​
The license agreement with Pfizer will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the license agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Pfizer can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to Rubraca and an obligation to assign or license to Pfizer any intellectual property rights or other rights we may have in Rubraca, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for Rubraca. 
​
AstraZeneca UK Limited
​
In April 2012, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca UK Limited (“AstraZeneca”) to acquire exclusive rights associated with Rubraca under a family of patents and patent applications that claim methods of treating patients with PARP inhibitors in certain indications. The license enables the development and commercialization of Rubraca for the uses claimed by these patents. AstraZeneca also receives royalties on net sales of Rubraca.
​
Advenchen Laboratories LLC 
​
On November 19, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of EOS pursuant to the terms set forth in that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2013 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, EOS, its shareholders (the “Sellers”) and Sofinnova Capital V FCPR, acting in its capacity as the Sellers’ representative. Following the acquisition, EOS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, in addition to the initial purchase price paid at the time of the closing of the acquisition and other license fees due to Advenchen described below, we will also be obligated to pay to the Sellers a milestone payment of $65.0 million upon obtaining the first NDA approval from the FDA with respect to lucitanib.
​
In October 2008, Ethical Oncology Science, S.p.A. (“EOS”) (now known as Clovis Oncology Italy S.r.l.) entered into an exclusive license agreement with Advenchen Laboratories LLC (“Advenchen”) to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China.
​
We are obligated to pay Advenchen tiered royalties at percentage rates in the mid-single digits on net sales of lucitanib, based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. In addition, after giving effect to the first and second amendments to the license agreement, we are required to pay to Advenchen 25% of any consideration, excluding royalties, we receive from sublicensees, in lieu of the milestone obligations set forth in the agreement. We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product containing lucitanib, and we are also responsible for all remaining development and commercialization costs for lucitanib.

The license agreement with Advenchen will remain in effect until the expiration of all our royalty obligations to Advenchen, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, Advenchen can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to lucitanib.

3B Pharmaceuticals GmbH (“3BP”)
​
In September 2019, we entered into a global license and collaboration agreement with 3BP to develop and commercialize a PTRT and imaging agent targeting FAP. The lead candidate, designated internally as FAP-2286, is being developed pursuant to a global development plan agreed to by the parties. We are responsible for the costs of all preclinical and clinical development activities described in the plan, including the costs for a limited number of 3BP full-time equivalents and external costs incurred during the preclinical development phase of the collaboration. Upon the signing of the license and collaboration agreement in September 2019, we made a $9.4 million upfront payment to 3BP, which we recognized as acquired in-process research and development expense.
​
Pursuant to the terms of the FAP agreement, we are required to make additional payments to 3BP for annual technology access fees and upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events (or on certain dates, whichever occur earlier). We are also obligated to pay 3BP single- to low-double-digit royalties on net sales of the FAP-targeted therapeutic product and imaging agent, based on the volume of annual net sales achieved. In addition, 3BP is entitled to receive 34% of any consideration, excluding royalties on the therapeutic product, pursuant to any sublicenses we may grant.
​
We are obligated under the license and collaboration agreement to use diligent efforts to develop FAP-2286 and commercialize a FAP-targeted therapeutic product and imaging agent, and we are responsible for all commercialization costs in our territory. The agreement with 3BP will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations to 3BP, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, 3BP can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights. 3BP also has the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances in connection with our change of control in which the acquiring party retains a product competitive with the FAP-targeted therapeutic product or, in the event marketing authorization has not yet been obtained, does not agree to the then-current global development plan.
​
In February 2020, we finalized the terms of a drug discovery collaboration agreement with 3BP to identify up to three additional, undisclosed targets for peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy, to which we will obtain global rights for any resulting product candidates. We are responsible for the costs of all preclinical and clinical development activities conducted under the discovery program, including the costs for a limited number of 3BP full-time equivalents and external costs incurred during the discovery and preclinical development phase for each collaboration target. The discovery collaboration agreement was effective December 31, 2019, for which we incurred a $2.1 million technology access fee, which we accrued and recognized as a research and development expense.
​
Pursuant to the terms of the discovery collaboration agreement, we are required to make additional payments to 3BP for annual technology access fees and upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events (or on certain dates, whichever occur earlier). We are also obligated to pay 3BP a 6% royalty on net sales of License Products (as defined in the agreement), based on the volume of quarterly net sales achieved.
​
We are obligated under the discovery collaboration agreement to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize the product candidates, if any, that result from the discovery program, and we are responsible for all clinical development and commercialization costs. The agreement with 3BP will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations to 3BP, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless we elect to terminate the agreement earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, 3BP can terminate the agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights.
​
Government Regulation
​
Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing and export and import of pharmaceutical products such as Rubraca and our other product candidates. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally placed on the market in the United States. In the European Union, a product requires approval from the European Commission (“EC”) following a favorable assessment from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) through the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) process for a product falling within the scope of the centralized procedure or a national MAA process (albeit through 

22




mutual recognition or decentralized procedure). Our product candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market.
​
U.S. Government Regulation 
​
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 


● | completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests (evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation) and non-clinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated at least annually;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application in the form of an NDA for the initial commercial sale of a product, or of a sNDA, for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and/or sites involved in clinical studies to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the marketing authorization application and product prescribing information prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug for the intended use.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer a product candidate to humans for further research of the drug candidate’s safety and/or efficacy. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan for the drug candidate and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the product candidate. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold requiring delay of a proposed clinical investigation, and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
​
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
​

23




The clinical investigation of a product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows: 


● | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of the product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
A pivotal study is a clinical study which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. 
​
Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA, an IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“IDMC”). The IDMC receives special access to un-blinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
​
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed product development information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or sNDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. 
​
The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
​
Once the marketing application submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within 10 months of acceptance for filing or, if the sponsor has been granted priority review designation, on the basis of an improvement in the treatments of a serious condition, six months from acceptance for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
​

24




After the FDA evaluates the NDA or sNDA and conducts inspections of clinical research facilities and/or manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. 
​
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. 
​
Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for quality and compliance, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
​
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
​
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
​
Regardless of whether we hold FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 
​
Medicines can be authorized in the EU by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. Under the centralized procedure, marketing authorization applications are submitted to the 

25




EMA whose CHMP reviews the application and issues an opinion on it. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for deciding applications. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer.
​
The national authorization procedures, the decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
​
As result of the United Kingdom (“UK”) leaving the EU, the UK is no longer part of the harmonized EU medicines network. The UK government introduced legislation to allow the continued registration, sale and access to medicinal products including regulation to allow implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. A comprehensive national regime for the authorization of medicinal products for human use; for the manufacture, import, distribution, sale and supply of those products; for their labelling and advertising; and for pharmacovigilance have been introduced. In Northern Ireland the, EU regulations will continue to apply in accordance with the Northern Ireland Protocol.
​
Available Special Regulatory Procedures 
​
Formal Meetings 
​
We are encouraged to engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the United States, there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. 
​
The EMA also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of CHMP. A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting. 
​
Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding commitments from the FDA in the United States, Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) procedures are available. A SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA’s agreement to a SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to a SPA. 
​
Orphan Drug Designation 
​
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that 

26




sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product. 
​
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. 
​
In Europe, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
​
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
​
Pediatric Development 
​
In the United States, the FDCA provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity for a drug if reports are filed of investigations studying the use of the drug product in a pediatric population in response to a written request from the FDA. Separate from this potential exclusivity benefit, NDAs must contain data (or a proposal for post-marketing activity) to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase II meeting and submission of the NDA. 
​
For the EMA, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, and/or a request for waiver or deferral, has to be agreed prior to submitting an initial marketing authorization application and prior to submitting a variation to an existing Marketing Authorization to add an additional indication. 
​
Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the United States
​
The U.S. Congress created the Breakthrough Therapy designation program as a result of the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012. FDA may grant Breakthrough Therapy status to a drug intended for the treatment of a serious condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The Breakthrough Therapy designation, which may be requested by a sponsor when filing or amending an IND, is intended to facilitate and expedite the development and FDA review of a product candidate. Specifically, the Breakthrough Therapy designation may entitle the sponsor to more frequent meetings with the FDA during drug development, intensive guidance on clinical trial design and expedited FDA review by a cross-disciplinary team comprised of senior managers. The designation does not guarantee a faster development or review time as compared to other drugs, however, nor does it assure that the drug will obtain ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. Once granted, the FDA may withdraw this designation at any time. 
​
Expedited Review and Approval in the United States 
​
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and biologics, and/or provide for the approval of a drug or biologic on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request 

27




of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the 60-day filing date, if the drug is a new molecular entity, rather than to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
​
Fast Track is a designation which is more similar to the Breakthrough Therapy designation, but is granted based on preliminary data including non-clinical or mechanistic data, and allows more frequent communication with FDA to expedite drug development
​
Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and is better than available therapy. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. The FDA will also consider the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition. As a condition of approval for drugs granted accelerated approval, one or more post-marketing confirmatory studies are required to confirm as predicted by the surrogate marker trial an effect on clinical benefit, which is defined as having a positive effect on how a patient feels, functions or survives. 
​
Accelerated Review in the European Union
​
Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g. heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days of submission of the MAA, excluding clock stops. 
​
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
​
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of Rubraca and any other drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of approved pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, public and private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved or European Commission/specific country-approved drugs for a particular indication (or all indications for an approved drug). Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain approvals. The development of a product dossier and a Budget Impact Model may be helpful in assisting the payors in evaluating cost effectiveness. In any event, our approved products may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be established. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Third-party payors impose price protection in their contracts with manufacturers to limit the manufacturer’s ability to increase price in exchange of providing equal access to the drug product vs. other competing drugs. 
​
There have been a number of federal and state proposals in recent years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. The U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval; 

28




however, to obtain payments under this program, we are required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”) was enacted in 2010 with a goal of reducing the cost of healthcare and substantially changing the way healthcare is financed by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act established: 


● | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the “donut hole”); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Since its enactment, there have been legal and Congressional challenges to repeal and replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act . Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. The Trump administration pursued several initiatives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. There is uncertainty with respect to the impact President Biden’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. 
​
Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as our products.
 ​
Moreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, have been subject to changes due to healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(“CMS”) began bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting. Additionally, on April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed into law, which, among other things, significantly alters the current payment methodology under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Beginning on January 1, 2018, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test, with some exceptions, is equal to the weighted median private payer payment for the test, as calculated using data collected by applicable laboratories during the data collection period and reported to CMS during a specified data reporting period. Also under PAMA, CMS is required to adopt temporary billing codes to identify new clinical diagnostic laboratory tests and advanced diagnostic laboratory tests that do not already have unique diagnostic codes, and that have been cleared or approved by the FDA.
​
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries and vary widely from country to country. In Europe, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund the cost of those products to consumers. These jurisdictions operate a system under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed for a defined population that, depending on country-specific negotiations, could be equal to European Commission-granted indication or a restricted population. To obtain reimbursement and pricing approval in Europe, some of these European countries may require additional economic evidence. In European countries, repeating price/reimbursement negotiations take place depending on local healthcare situations and can lead to lower reimbursed prices over time.
​
The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasing high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, especially in Europe, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. In 

29




particular, for each new indication, new negotiations are required to obtain reimbursement in European countries; also, pricing negotiations in European countries are often linked to baskets of comparator countries; due to Brexit, it is currently unclear whether changes in country baskets will take place anytime soon. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in Europe do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
​
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may be impacted by government and third-party coverage and reimbursement decisions. In addition, emphasis on reducing the rate of healthcare spending in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. There has been particular and increasing legislative interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. Certain independent charitable foundations operate programs that provide grants to defray medical expenses (including cost-sharing obligations for drug treatments and health insurance premiums) for patients who meet certain financial need criteria and suffer from specific chronic illnesses or rare disorders. There has been recent enforcement interest regarding donations by pharmaceutical manufacturers to such foundations on the bases that such donations were used in part to guide patients to those donors’ products or that the donors obtained data on how the donations were used, including how often donations correlate to the frequency of referrals to donors’ products. There have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
​
Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time in the U.S. and Europe. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.
​
Advertising and Promotion
​
The FDA and other U.S. federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, the FDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations and standards. The FDA’s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, communications regarding unapproved or “off-label” uses, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions regarding unapproved uses of a drug or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations, may result in adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. A range of penalties are possible that could have significant commercial consequences, including product seizures, injunctions, administrative remedies, civil and/or criminal fines, agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes its products, or regulatory enforcement letters which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals or consumers.
​
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
​
We are subject to various laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including federal and state anti-kickback laws and false-claims laws. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and administrative remedies such as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, 

30




which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim submitted in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
​
The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal program, including federal healthcare programs. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil fines and penalties. 
​
In addition, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid-payable items or services, may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $20,000 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the federal Anti-kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties. One of the statutory exceptions to this prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. To the extent our patient assistance programs are found to be inconsistent with applicable laws, we may be required to restructure or discontinue such programs or be subject to significant penalties.
​
In addition to the laws described above, drug manufacturers must report to CMS payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information to CMS may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $176,495 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.176 million per year for “knowing failures”), adjusted for inflation, for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Applicable drug manufacturers are required to collect data for each calendar year and submit reports to CMS by March 31st of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, there is also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws impose administrative and compliance burdens that may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities.
​
For marketed products which are covered in the United States by the Medicaid program, we have various obligations, including government price calculation and reporting and rebate requirements which generally require products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the execution of government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The guidance governing such calculations is not always clear and may require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources in order to comply. Failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. 
​
One component of the rebate and discount calculations under the Medicaid and 340B programs is the “additional rebate”, a complex calculation which is based, in part, on the rate at which a branded drug’s price increases over time as 

31




compared to the rate of inflation (based on the CPI-U published by the United States Department of Labor). This calculation is based on the baseline pricing data for the first full quarter of sales associated with a branded drug’s NDA, and baseline data cannot generally be reset, even on transfer of the NDA to another manufacturer. This “additional rebate” calculation can, in some cases where price increases have been relatively high versus the first quarter of sales of the NDA, result in Medicaid rebates up to 100% of a drug’s “average manufacturer price” and 340B prices of one penny. Separately, subject to the control of Directive 89/105/EEC, pricing and reimbursement in the EU/EEA (“European Economic Area”) is governed by national rules and policies and may vary from Member State to Member State.
​
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) outlines several federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. Most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
​
The privacy and protection of consumer information remains a developing area and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments both in the United States as well as Europe. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective on January 1, 2020 and, as enacted, requires us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use, and sharing practices. It also provides a cause of action for data breaches. Beyond California, many other states are developing their own data privacy protections, which, along with the CCPA, could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018 and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act and Data Protection Ordinance, regulate the processing of personal data within the U.K., the EU and between countries in the EU, U.K. and countries outside of the EU and U.K., including the U.S. Failure to provide adequate privacy protections and maintain compliance with the EU, U.K. and Swiss Privacy Laws, could jeopardize business transactions across borders and result in significant penalties. Similar to the impact of the CCPA or other U.S. state frameworks, these European laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.
​
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests 
​
In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, non-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Diagnostic tests are classified as medical devices under the FDCA. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution, depending on their classification by FDA. 
​
In the United States, devices are classified into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the controls deemed necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I and II devices are subject to general controls including, but not limited to, performance standards, premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and post market surveillance. Class III devices are those that either support or sustains human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Class III devices are subject to more rigorous review and approval requirements than Class I or II, known as a premarket approval, or PMA approval. Because the diagnostic tests being developed by our third-party collaborators are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, they are considered Class III devices, subject to the PMA approval process.
​
PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, non-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the 

32




manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
​
We and our third-party collaborators who are developing companion diagnostics work cooperatively to generate the data required for submission with a PMA application, and remain in close contact with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) at the FDA to ensure that any changes in requirements are incorporated into the development plans. Meetings with the FDA with regard to our drug product candidates, as well as companion diagnostic product candidates, typically include representatives from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and CDRH when appropriate to ensure that the NDA and PMA submissions are coordinated to enable FDA to conduct a parallel review of both submissions. The FDA has issued guidance documents addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to these guidance documents, for novel therapeutic products such as our product candidates, the PMA for a companion diagnostic device should generally be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic.
​
In the EEA, in vitro medical devices are required to conform to the essential requirements of the E.U. Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. The data generated for the U.S. registration will be sufficient to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the EU and other countries. 
​
Patents and Proprietary Rights
​
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, technology and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
 ​
In June 2011, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Pfizer to develop and commercialize rucaparib. In April 2012, we obtained an exclusive license from AstraZeneca under a family of patents and patent applications which permits the development and commercialization of rucaparib for certain methods of treating patients with PARP inhibitors. 
​
We were granted patent term extension to November 22, 2023 under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) for U.S. Patent 6,495,541 directed to the rucaparib composition of matter. Additionally, other patents and patent applications are directed to methods of making, methods of using, dosing regimens, various salt and polymorphic forms, and formulations with expiration dates through potentially 2035. These patents and patent applications include the rucaparib camsylate salt/polymorph patent family licensed from Pfizer, which expires in 2031, and a patent family directed to high dosage strength rucaparib tablets, which expires in 2035. To date, the rucaparib camsylate salt/polymorph patents issued in 51 jurisdictions (including the United States and Europe), with applications pending in 7 jurisdictions. Patents directed to the high dosage strength rucaparib tablets, including all 

33




commercial dosage strengths, issued in the United States and 5 other jurisdictions, and applications are pending in 13 jurisdictions, including before the European Patent Office. United States patents with claims that cover Rubraca and its uses are listed in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. 
​
Because Rubraca does not contain a previously approved active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides a five-year period of new chemical entity (“NCE”) exclusivity following its December 19, 2016 approval during which time generic competitors cannot file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for a generic version of Rubraca, unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV Certification that one or more patents listed in the Orange Book for Rubraca are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by a proposed ANDA product, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original drug approval. That is, under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, December 19, 2020 was the earliest date that a generic competitor could submit an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to market a generic version of Rubraca. To date, we do not have an indication that an ANDA has been filed. However, a generic company may have submitted an ANDA, for which we would receive a Paragraph IV Notice Letter in the future. If a Paragraph IV Certification is made, the generic company is required to provide a Paragraph IV Notice Letter advising Clovis of the certification. If that occurs, Clovis will have the opportunity to bring a patent infringement action against the generic company. If such a suit is filed within the 45-day period following receipt of the Paragraph IV Notice Letter, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a 30-month stay on FDA’s ability to grant final approval of the proposed generic product. The 30-month stay generally runs from the date the Paragraph IV Notice Letter is received. However, when a Paragraph IV certification is received during the five-year period of NCE exclusivity following the date of first NDA approval, the thirty-month stay extends from five years after the date that product was first approved. The 30-month stay may be shortened or lengthened, including due to a settlement of a lawsuit, a court order (including a decision by the district court on the merits of the case), or patent expiration.

Two European patents in the rucaparib camsylate salt/polymorph patent family (European Patent 2534153 and its divisional European Patent 3150610) were opposed. In particular, opposition notices against European Patent 2534153 were filed by two parties on June 20, 2017. During an oral hearing that took place on December 4, 2018, the European Patent Office’s Opposition Division maintained European Patent 2534153 in amended and narrowed form with claims to certain crystalline forms of rucaparib camsylate, including, but not limited to, rucaparib S-camsylate Form A, the crystalline form in Rubraca. Clovis and one opponent, Hexal AG, appealed the written decision of the European Opposition Division and filed reply appeal briefs in November 2019. An opposition against European Patent 3150610 was filed by Generics (UK) Limited on April 30, 2020 on grounds similar to those raised in the opposition notices against European Patent 2534153, which grounds are common in such proceedings. Moreover, these grounds of opposition, as well as documents based on which lack of patentability has been alleged, were considered by the European Patent Office during the examination stage, and the claims were deemed to comply with the applicable law when granting the patent. Clovis responded to the opposition notice in European Patent 3150610 on January 8, 2021, amending the claims to be directed to the use of rucaparib maleate in a method of inhibiting PARP activity or treating cancer. A preliminary opinion and summons to oral proceedings were issued on January 26, 2021. The oral hearing is scheduled for November 18, 2021. The preliminary opinion provides a non-binding indication of the Opposition Division’s initial view based on the documents that have thus far been submitted, which agrees with our positions on a number of grounds of opposition and agrees with an objection made by the opponent, but only with respect to some of the claims. We have the opportunity to submit further arguments and pursue alternative claims in the form of auxiliary requests. While the ultimate results of patent challenges can be difficult to predict, it is our view that a number of factors support patentability, and we believe a successful challenge of all claims would be difficult. 

We have filed for patent term extension under a supplementary protection certificate for Rubraca based on European Patent 2534153 and believe that extension could be available to 2033. Additionally, in Europe, regulatory exclusivity is available for ten years, plus one year for a new indication; therefore, we have regulatory exclusivity for Rubraca in Europe until 2028, and if an additional indication is approved, until 2029.
​
We obtained rights to lucitanib by acquiring EOS in November 2013, along with its license agreement with Advenchen. We have rights to develop and commercialize lucitanib on a global basis, excluding China. Composition of matter and method of use patent protection for lucitanib and a group of structurally-related compounds is issued in the United States, Europe, and Japan and is issued or pending in other jurisdictions. In the United States, the composition of matter patent will expire in 2030, and in other jurisdictions, it expires in 2028. We believe that patent term extension could be available to extend our composition of matter patent up to five years beyond the scheduled expiration under the 

34




Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, and similar provisions in other jurisdictions. Additionally, patents directed to methods of manufacturing lucitanib are issued in the United States, Europe, Japan, and China. 
​
In September 2019, we acquired rights from 3BP to develop and commercialize a peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy (“PTRT”) and imaging agent targeting fibroblast activation protein alpha (“FAP”), including FAP-2286. We hold global development rights, and U.S. and global commercialization rights, excluding Europe (inclusive of Russia, Turkey and Israel), where 3BP retains rights. Patent applications are pending that claim FAP-2286 generically and specifically (including with respect to composition of matter) that, if issued, would have expiration dates in 2040.
​
In addition, we intend to seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates and related technology we acquire in the future. 
​
The patent positions of pharmaceutical firms like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Consequently, we do not know whether any of the product candidates we acquire, or license will gain patent protection or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, until that time we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”) to determine priority of invention or in opposition or other third-party proceedings in the U.S. or a foreign patent office, either of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued, would be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in a third-party patent dispute could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using specific compounds or technology. 
​
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries or jurisdictions in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. PTO in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent. 
​
The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. 
​
To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, or avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights. These types of proceedings are often costly and could be very time-consuming to us, and we cannot assure you that the deciding authorities will rule in our favor. An unfavorable decision could allow third parties to use our technology without being required to pay us licensing fees or may compel us to license needed technologies to a third-party. Such a decision could even result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents or pending patent applications. To the extent prudent, we intend to bring litigation against third parties that we believe are infringing one or more of our patents.
​
In addition, we have sought and intend to continue seeking orphan drug status whenever it is available. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in certain very limited 

35




circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication. 
​
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. However, we believe that the substantial costs and resources required to develop technological innovations will help us to protect the competitive advantage of our products. 
​
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. 
​
Manufacturing
​
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for commercial use, or non-clinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We currently have long-term agreements with third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the production of the active ingredient and final product for Rubraca. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial and clinical quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, we are working with our current third-party suppliers to ensure sufficient capacity to meet our manufacturing requirements. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers.
​
We have developed the process for manufacturing Rubraca’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) to a degree sufficient to meet clinical demands and projected commercial requirements. Manufacturing of Rubraca API is being performed by Lonza Ltd (“Lonza”). Manufacturing operations for an advanced intermediate, which is the inventory prior to conversion to API, was expanded to a second Lonza site during 2019. The Rubraca drug product formulation and manufacturing process to produce that formulation have been developed to a degree sufficient to meet clinical demands and projected commercial requirements. A single third-party CMO capable of both formulation development and drug product manufacturing is currently producing the Rubraca drug product.
​
To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements and we expect them to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands.
​
Lonza Agreement - Rubraca
​
On October 3, 2016, we entered into an agreement with Lonza for the long-term manufacture and supply of the API for rucaparib. Under this agreement, Lonza is a non-exclusive manufacturer of the Rubraca API during the 10-year term of the agreement. Lonza constructed, in an existing Lonza facility, a production train that is exclusively dedicated to the manufacture of the Rubraca API. The dedicated production train provides manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs for commercial supply of Rubraca API. We are obligated to make scheduled capital program fee payments toward capital equipment and other costs associated with the construction of the dedicated production train. Further, once the production train became operational in October 2018, we are obligated to pay a fixed facility fee each quarter for the duration of the Agreement, which expires on December 31, 2025, unless extended by mutual consent of the parties.
​
Either party may terminate the agreement due to a material breach of the agreement by the other party, subject to prior written notice and a cure period. We may terminate the agreement, subject to 90 days’ prior written notice, in the event Rubraca is withdrawn from the market for certain reasons. In the event of such a termination by us, or termination by Lonza due to material breach by us, we are obligated to compensate Lonza for any services rendered, or for which costs have been incurred by Lonza in anticipation of services to be provided to us, and to pay to Lonza the remaining 

36




amount of any capital program fees and quarterly fixed facility fees for the remainder of the term of the agreement. In the event we terminate the agreement due to material breach by Lonza, Lonza is obligated to repay all or a portion of the capital program fees previously paid by us.
​
Lucitanib
​
The API for lucitanib is currently being produced by a CMO. To date, the current production process has been sufficient to satisfy immediate clinical demands. We may undertake additional development work to further optimize the active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing process. The finished drug product for lucitanib is currently being manufactured at a CMO. The current product and process are sufficiently developed to meet immediate clinical demands. Additional scale-up work and/or additional production capacity will be necessary to support larger clinical development or commercialization requirements. 
​
Commercial Operations
​
Our commercial organizations in the U.S. and Europe are in place and supporting the commercial sale of Rubraca. We believe the oncology market for Rubraca is addressable with a targeted sales and marketing organization, with capabilities that include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, oncology group networks and government accounts. We sell Rubraca through a limited distribution network consisting of select number of specialty pharmacies and distributors. Healthcare providers prescribe Rubraca to patients and the specialty pharmacies and distributors dispense Rubraca directly to patients. We intend to continue promoting Rubraca ourselves for its current indications and any additional indications we may obtain in the future. We retain the rights to Rubraca in the rest of the world. 
​
In October 2020, we adopted a new U.S. commercial strategy to address a challenging sales environment resulting from a trend toward reduced in-person access for oncology commercial teams to oncology practices in general, which has been further accelerated by COVID-19, which has severely limited oncology patient visits and cancer diagnoses. Physicians increasingly prefer digital communications and virtual peer-to-peer interactions which they can access when they choose. The new hybrid strategy elevates digital programming, virtual communication and peer-to-peer interactions while reducing in-person promotion, and the remaining in-person activities will be much more targeted. This hybrid strategy does not require as large a U.S. commercial organization, and in early November the size of the organization was reduced by approximately 45 employees, resulting in a U.S. commercial team of approximately 85 employees. 
​
Customers 
​
We are currently approved to sell Rubraca in the U.S. and Europe markets. We distribute our product principally through a limited number of specialty distributor and specialty pharmacy providers, collectively, our customers. Our customers subsequently sell our products to patients and health care providers. We do not believe the loss of one of these customers would significantly impact the ability to distribute our product as we expect that sales volume would be absorbed evenly by the remaining customers. Separately, we have arrangements with certain payors and other third parties that provide for government-mandated and privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts.
​
Employees
​
As of February 12, 2021, we had 429 employees, of which 291 were employed in the U.S. and 138 were employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions, and a very small number of international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
​
Our success depends upon our ability to retain and attract highly qualified management and technical personnel. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute on our long-term growth strategy. We appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. We continue to be committed to an inclusive culture which values equality, opportunity and respect. In support of our inclusive culture, we believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits, including an annual pay gap assessment; provide respectful workplace training to strengthen employee understanding; and strive to recruit a diverse talent pool across all levels of the organization.

Employee safety and wellbeing is of paramount importance to us in any year and was of particular focus in our fiscal year 2020 in light of COVID-19. In response to the pandemic, we provided productivity and collaboration tools and resources for employees working remotely, including training and toolkits to help leaders effectively lead and manage remote teams. In addition, we enhanced and promoted programs to support our employees’ physical and mental wellbeing.
