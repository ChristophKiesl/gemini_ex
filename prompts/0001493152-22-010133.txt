ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
Our Business
 
We are a cell therapy company focused on immunotherapy. Since our inception, we have been involved with the development of proprietary immune system management technology (“Cell Source technology”) licensed from Yeda Research & Development Company Limited (“Yeda”), the commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science (“Weizmann Institute”) in Israel. The current focus of our Research and Development efforts is at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”) in Houston, Texas.
 
This technology addresses one of the most fundamental challenges within human immunology: how to tune the immune response such that it tolerates selected desirable foreign cells, but continues to attack all other (undesirable) targets. In simpler terms, a number of potentially life-saving treatments have limited effectiveness today because the patient’s immune system rejects them. For example, while HSCT - hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (e.g. bone marrow transplantation) has become a preferred therapeutic approach for treating blood cell cancer, most patients do not have a matched family donor. Although matched unrelated donors and cord blood can each provide an option for such patients, haploidentical stem cell transplants (sourced from partially mismatched family members) are rapidly gaining favor as a treatment of choice. This is still a risky and difficult procedure primarily due to potential conflicts between host and donor immune systems and as well as viral infections that often follow even successful HSCT while the compromised new immune system works to reconstitute itself by using the transplanted stem cells. Today, rejection is partially overcome using aggressive immune suppression treatments that leave the patient exposed to many dangers by compromising their immune system.
 
The unique advantage of Cell Source technology lies in the ability to induce sustained tolerance of transplanted cells (or organs) by the recipient’s immune system in a setting that requires only mild immune suppression, while avoiding the most common transplant related complications. The scientific term for inducing such tolerance in a transplantation setting is chimerism, where the recipient’s immune system tolerates the co-existence of the (genetically different) donor type and host (recipient) type cells. Attaining sustained chimerism is an important prerequisite to achieving the intrinsic GvL (graft versus leukemia) effect of HSCT and supporting the reconstitution of normal hematopoiesis (generation of blood cells, including those that protect healthy patients from cancer) in blood cancer patients. Preclinical data, as well as initial clinical data show that Cell Source’s Veto Cell technology (currently in a trial in the US) can provide superior results in allogeneic (donor-derived) HSCT by allowing for haploidentical stem cell transplants under a mild conditioning regimen, while avoiding the most common post-transplant complications. Combining this with CAR (Chimeric Antigen Receptor) T cell therapy employing Veto Cells, as a VETO CAR-T treatment, we will be able to treat patients in relapse as well as those in remission and use the cancer killing power of CAR-T to protect the patient while their immune system fully reconstitutes, thus providing an end-to-end solution for blood cancer treatment by potentially delivering a fundamentally safer and more effective allogeneic HSCT: prevention of relapse; avoidance of graft versus host disease (GvHD); prevention of viral infections; and enhanced persistence of GvL effect. This means that the majority of patients will be able to find a donor, and will have access to a potentially safer procedure with higher long term survival rates than what either donor-derived HSCT or autologous CAR-T each on their own currently provide.
 
The ability to induce permanent chimerism (and thus sustained tolerance) in patients – which allows the transplantation to overcome rejection without having to compromise the rest of the immune system - may open the door to effective treatment of a number of severe medical conditions, in addition to blood cancers, which are characterized by this need. These include:
 

● | The broader set of cancers, including solid tumors, that can potentially be treated effectively using genetically modified cells such as CAR-T cell therapy, but also face efficacy and economic constraints due to limited persistence based on immune system issues (i.e., the need to be able to safely and efficiently deliver allogeneic CAR-T therapy). Inducing sustained tolerance to CAR-T cells may bring reduced costs and increased efficacy by allowing for off-the-shelf (vs. patient-derived) treatments with more persistent cancer killing capability. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Organ failure and transplantation. A variety of conditions can be treated by the transplantation of vital organs. However, transplantation is limited both by the insufficient supply of available donor organs and the need for lifelong, daily anti-reject treatments post-transplant. Haploidentical organ transplants, with sustained chimerism, have the potential to make life saving transplants accessible to the majority of patients, with the prospect of improved life quality and expectancy. 
● | Non-malignant hematological conditions (such as type one diabetes and sickle cell anemia) which could, in many cases, also be more effectively treated by stem cell transplantation if the procedure could be made safer and more accessible by inducing sustained tolerance in the stem cell transplant recipient.

Corporate History
 
Cell Source, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Nevada corporation formed on June 6, 2012 under the name Ticket to See, Inc. (“TTSI”). Cell Source Ltd. (“Cell Source Israel”) was founded in 2011 in order to commercialize a suite of inventions that were the result of over ten (10) years of research at the Weizmann Institute. Pursuant to a Research and License Agreement by and between Cell Source Israel and Yeda, dated October 3, 2011, as amended in April, 2014, November, 2016, March, 2018, August 2019, December, 2019, November, 2020, and December, 2021 (the “Yeda License Agreement”), Yeda, the commercial arm of the Weizmann Institute, granted Cell Source Israel an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, discoveries, inventions, and other intellectual property generated (together with others) by Yair Reisner, Ph.D. (“Dr. Reisner”), former head of the Immunology Department at the Weizmann Institute.
 
Implications of being a Smaller Reporting Company
 
As a company with less than $100 million in revenue during our last fiscal year and a public float of less than $250 million, we qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. A “smaller reporting company” may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements and disclosure obligations that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
 

● | being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report on Form 10-K; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and 
● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements. 

 
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a “smaller reporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.
 
Hematological Malignancies
 
Hematological malignancies (blood cancers) comprise a variety of lymphomas and leukemias. A very important treatment protocol for these malignancies involves the use of HSCT. To the best of our knowledge, over 1,500,000 HSCT have been performed worldwide with the annual number of procedures approaching 100,000 (table below). Our technology has immediate relevance for, at a minimum, the roughly 40,000 worldwide stem cell transplants that are allogeneic (using cells taken from another individual, not the patient). According to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (“CIMBTR”), there were 8,326 allogeneic stem cell transplants in the US in 2020.

HSCT often has a curative effect when successful. However, it is very risky. HSCT typically involves destroying the patient’s native immune system with radiation or chemotherapy (myeloablation) before the transplantation, and then suppressing immune response (immunosuppression) with drugs to manage the conflicts between host and donor cells. The majority of patients are unable to find a matched family donor. Over 50% of all adult haploidentical transplant patients in the US suffering from AML (the most common indication for allogeneic HSCT) die within three years of transplantation. Among adult patients receiving haploidentical HSCT, of those who die in the first 100 days post-transplant, 35% die from either infections (associated with a compromised immune system), graft rejection or GvHD (Graft versus Host Disease).

Myeloablation and immunosuppression are dangerous and difficult to tolerate, especially in patients over age 50. Therefore, HSCT has been used mainly with younger patients.
 
Another very important treatment protocol for blood cancers is CAR-T cell therapy. This novel approach uses the patient’s own immune system cells to directly attack cancer cells. CAR-T cells are made by removing a specific set of cells from the blood, genetically modifying them in order to intensify the immune system’s natural response to cancer, and then re-injecting them into the patient. This form of cellular therapy has produced exceptional near term results in blood cancer patients and is currently being tested against a variety of different cancer types.
 
CAR T-cell therapy has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as standard therapy for some patients with lymphoma (drug names Yescarta, Kymriah, Tecartus and Breyanzi), leukemia (drug name Kymriah) and multiple myeloma (drug names Abecma and Carvykti).
 
These approved treatments use the patient’s own cells in order to create CAR-T cells, which involves high cost (between $373,000 and $475,000 per infusion) and significant safety risks (e.g. high rate of relapse, significant incidence of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)). While a number of companies are attempting to develop allogeneic or “off-the-shelf” CAR-T, they face several challenges including rejection by the host’s immune system and GvHD. The currently approved CAR-T treatments, while showing high early response rates, have not shown long term survival results for blood cancer that exceed those of allogeneic HSCT.
 
This means that:
 

a) | many blood cancer patients are not candidates for the primary treatment (HSCT) that represents a potential cure; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | there is high mortality among those patients who are candidates for HSCT and do undergo the procedure; 
c) | CAR-T cell therapy, which is currently used in limited indications and has had relatively slow adoption, has yet to demonstrate long term survival that substantively exceeds that of HSCT. 

 
There is widespread awareness of the need for improved immune-system management technologies for HSCT - both to improve outcomes of transplantations for the traditional target set of patients and to expand the use of the procedure by making transplantation safe enough to become appropriate for a broader set of patients.
 
There is also a strong awareness for the need of an off-the-shelf approach to CAR-T that overcomes rejection, avoids GvHD, and has increased persistence so as to deliver longer-term efficacy.

We aspire to use VETO CAR-T, combining Veto Cell technology with allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy, to dramatically improve the outcomes of the allogeneic transplantations already being performed, and thereby to rapidly penetrate the current market. However, our target population greatly exceeds those patients who currently undergo HSCT or CAR-T, as the firm’s tolerizing technology could potentially make allogeneic transplantation and off-the-shelf CAR-T an option for a much larger proportion of the diseased population. The following table shows the incidence of the specific hematological malignancies on which we will focus:
 

Initial Malignancy Indications (note estimates for North America and EU only) | Incidence (Annual New Cases) | | Annual HSCT 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-------------
Lymphoma | | 225,241 | | 22,505
Leukemia | | 156,898 | | 26,423
Multiple Myeloma | | 83,868 | | 38424 
Total | | 466,007 | | 87,352

For the purposes of this document, it is assumed that the immediate candidates for Cell Source-enabled HSCT will be the subset of cancer patients that today receive transplantations as part of their cancer treatment (rightmost column in table above). We believe that a portion of these patients will benefit from Veto Cell adjunct therapy, as such therapy aspires to improve the success and reduce the risk and mortality of a procedure that they are having anyway. With time, as Veto Cell treatment becomes more widespread and data is accumulated, we believe that the percentage of patients that will be referred for Veto Cell enabled HSCT will increase significantly.
 
It is also important to note that incidence of these diseases is increasing. The global market for blood cancer therapeutics was estimated at $41 billion in 2020 and is projected to increase in size to over $90 billion by 2028 according to Polaris Market Research Blood Cancer Drugs Market Share, Size, Trends, Industry Analysis Report June. The aging of the US population and the increased incidence of hematologic malignancies are expected to significantly increase the number of older patients who receive allogeneic HSCT.
 
HSCT Market Trends
 
There are four important market trends affecting the hematological malignancies market:
 

1) | As noted above, increasing incidence of these disorders, largely driven by the aging population. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Improvement and proliferation of HSCT treatments. 
3) | A “virtuous circle” of lowered death rate due to better transplantations leading to more aggressive focus on HSCT. 
4) | The growing use of milder conditioning regimens, which makes the procedure more survivable for older patients (see table below). 

 

However, despite the above trends, the use of HSCT, especially allogeneic, remains limited because of the risks associated with the myeloablative treatments required to reduce the host immune response, viral infections and GvHD. This means that the “gold-standard” of treatment is largely unavailable to an age cohort that constitute a significant proportion of sufferers of these diseases.
 
The Company aspires to address this issue in a distinctive manner by significantly reducing the need for myeloablative treatment while avoiding the risk of GvHD, thereby improving the outlook for allogeneic transplantations and enabling their use in a much larger population set.

CAR-T cell therapy
 
One of the most promising new approaches to treating hematological malignancies is by using genetically modified T cells in treatments such as CAR-T and TCR. CAR-T cell therapy for blood cancers, which has already been approved by the FDA, has shown the ability to attain remissions in a significant proportion of those patients treated. That said, the number of patients treated has been relatively low, in part due to the significant costs associated with this treatment. Since the approved treatment products rely on autologous (patient derived) production of the CAR-T cells, the costs can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single treatment, with the cost of the infusion alone ranging between $373,000 and $475,000 in the US. The broader hope for CAR-T cell therapy is for an allogeneic or “off the shelf” version that is expected to significantly lower the treatment costs.
 
Cell Source has completed a preclinical proof-of-concept in collaboration with Professor Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T cell technology, combining CAR-T and Veto Cell technology so as to allow for a successful allogeneic approach to CAR-T cell therapy.
 
Relevant Non-Malignant Diseases
 
While Hematological malignancies represent the Company’s initial focus, the Company’s selective immune response blocking technology may also be effective in treating certain non-malignant organ diseases as well as blood and immune system disorders. This would represent an additional growth opportunity for the Company.
 
The target non-malignant diseases are widespread. The Company’s first non-malignant disorder target is expected to be is support of organ transplantations (kidney, liver, etc.). Approximately 100,000 kidney and 35,000 liver transplants are conducted worldwide each year. As with bone marrow transplantations, organ transplantations require substantial and ongoing immunosuppression to prevent rejection. This ongoing treatment is dangerous, quality-of-life and life expectancy reducing, and costly. The Company’s Veto Cell technology can potentially be used to selectively reduce immune response to the transplanted organ, thus broadening the donor pool and reducing or possibly eliminating the need for daily, life-long immunosuppression post transplantation.
 
A second target within non-malignant disorders are blood diseases such as sickle cell disease, aplastic anemia, beta thalassemia and scleroderma. Sickle cell anemia, for example, can be effectively treated by HSCT. However, because of HSCT’s riskiness, the procedure is currently used only in extreme cases. If successful in enabling safer HSCT, the Company can make this treatment available to a broader set of sickle cell anemia sufferers. Preclinical data have also shown the potential effectiveness of Veto Cells in preventing the development of Type 1 Diabetes.
 
Market Access and Channels
 
The market for stem cell transplantation is relatively concentrated. There are over 1,700 transplantation centers worldwide, of which some 700 are in North America and Western Europe.
 
A relatively small subset of these (often termed “Centers of Excellence”) tends to set the practice standards for the entire transplantation community. Therefore, as discussed in the “Strategy” section, the Company plans to focus its initial penetration strategy on a relatively small group of influential centers. There are over 150 centers in the US today that provide CAR-T cell therapy treatments.
 
Reimbursement issues for our therapies are expected to be relatively straightforward. Once clinical effectiveness and regulatory approval are established, the value-proposition for payors and providers is expected to be clear and compelling. Issues connected with immunosuppression and rejection constitute a major component of bone marrow transplantation costs, and significant improvement in this area is expected to bring substantive cost-savings for payors.
 
Sector Focus
 
We are in the overall arena of immunotherapy. The cancer immunotherapy market was estimated at approximately $85 billion for 2021 and projected to grow to over $277 billion by 2030, according to Precedence Research.
 
Within the immunotherapy field, our initial focus is on allogeneic therapies (treatments using donor derived-as opposed to patient derived-cells), with a focus on haploidentical transplantations (transplantations that use cells from partially matched-as opposed to fully matched-donors and recipients). While potentially valuable, allogeneic therapies are relatively complex, risky, and expensive. A key driver of this complexity and associated costs is the conflict between host and donor immune systems, as discussed above.
 
Our technology, which in preclinical studies, as well as in a first-in-human proof of concept, has shown the ability to enable tolerance of donor cells without affecting other immune processes, is fundamentally enabling. We expect it to significantly increase the safety, reduce the overall treatment cost, and therefore broaden the scope of indications for such procedures.

The delivery method for Veto Cell treatments would take the form of a non-invasive cell suspension treatment administered intravenously. For HSCT treatments, Veto Cells are derived from stem cells taken from the same donor who is providing the stem cells for the transplantation itself. In the case of VETO CAR-T cell therapy, this will initially be combined with HSCT, but a more generic “off the shelf” modality offering is planned, which would eventually be marketed as a pre-packaged suspension of cells and medium, prepared and stored in advance.
 
Our Value Drivers
 
Our current positioning in the cancer immunotherapy value chain is typical of an early clinical stage company: developing, validating and attaining regulatory approvals for the various applications of our technology platforms. Going forward, once the products are commercialized, physician and patient interest in these treatments is expected to drive insurer reimbursement for patients - a key demand lever. The generic value chain for biotechnology development commences with an invention which is formulated, patented and successful in pre-clinical animal trials. We have already passed this stage with our Veto Cell technology platform, for which we have an exclusive license to use from Yeda, the owner of these patents. We are currently at the stage of human trials (testing both safety and efficacy). Finally, the offering earns regulatory approval and patient treatment, along with the ensuing revenues, can commence. This can be a particularly lengthy process in the United States and therefore some medical treatments are approved in Europe or Asia and generate revenues there prior to commencing U.S. sales. Recently expanded “fast track” regulation in the U.S. is aimed at getting critical treatments for life threatening conditions to patients more quickly.
 
Our successful preclinical validation of the Veto Cell treatment involved basic laboratory research including both in-vivo (live) animal trials and in-vitro (in a glass dish) human cell trials. This validated the protocol prior to commencing human clinical trials. Human clinical trials fine-tune the treatment protocol and confirm both safety and efficacy in treating patents. In parallel, the patents on the core technology go into the national phase in various countries and are emended with claims associated with exact treatment protocols, bolstering the protection afforded by already issued patents on the base technology.
 
In some cases, successful biotech companies have been able to capitalize on positive human clinical results (even prior to full approval for patient treatment) by either signing lucrative non-dilutive distribution option deals or by being partially or fully acquired by larger market participants. KITE Pharmaceuticals, a CAR-T cell therapy company, was acquired outright by Gilead Sciences in 2017 for $11.9 billion in cash, prior to having attained FDA approval and prior to commencing any product sales. In 2018, Juno Therapeutics was acquired by Celgene Corporation for approximately $9 billion, also without having FDA approval for its CAR-T cell therapy technology. There is no indication or assurance that we are currently under consideration for any option or acquisition deal.
 
We are currently conducting a human clinical trial for approval for the Veto Cell based treatments in the United States. We have had positive preclinical results for three of our cell therapy treatments. Yeda, the proprietary owners of the patents underlying our technologies from whom we license our patents, has been granted patents for its original Veto Cell. The revised versions of the Veto Cell are the subject of patent applications which have been granted in some jurisdictions and are pending in others. These newer patent applications both leverage the priority of the already granted patents and extend the protection period for more advanced versions. We are currently engaged in our first human clinical trial. If such trials are successful, they will demonstrate both safety (the patients survived and were not harmed) and initial indications of efficacy (there are signs of successful engraftment under a mild conditioning regimen, with a reduction in GvHD, and in the case of cancer patients prolonging the progression free period).
 
Science and Technology Overview
 
The patent portfolio that we license from Yeda includes a variety of cell therapy applications. The portfolio includes both granted and pending patents. The total relevant patent portfolio consists of 15 patent “families” (i.e. grouping of similar patent applications in different territorial jurisdictions) which currently include: 56 granted patents; 5 allowed/accepted patents; and a further 43 pending patents. The key terms of the agreement pursuant to which we license all of Yeda’s patents related to our technology is set forth in the section entitled “Intellectual Property” herein. The license period (per product, per country) is for the full life of the patents and expires at the later of the patent expiration date in that country or 15 years after the date that the FDA or local equivalent regulatory authority in each country approves that particular product for sale in that country. Provided that Cell Source either sponsors research or pays either a nominal license fee of $50,000 per year (total for use of all the products), or pays royalties on product sales on at least one product as per the license agreement, the license will remain in effect continuously and expire only with the expiration of the patent or 15 years after regulatory approval (later of the two) per product per country as described above.
 
Professor Yair Reisner, the inventor of Veto Cell technology, left the Weizmann Institute and relocated to MD Anderson in Houston, Texas. He has been awarded a $6 million grant from the Cancer Research and Prevention Institute of Texas. This, coupled with research funding from the University itself, provides him with a total funding commitment of $10 million for five years. Professor Reisner is now the Head of Stem Cell Research at the Department of Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy as well as the Reisner Laboratory at MD Anderson.

Cell Source is currently sponsoring ongoing research by Professor Reisner and his team, many of whom have also relocated from the Weizmann Institute to MD Anderson, for developing existing and new applications for Veto Cell technology and plans to license any new intellectual property developed there on an exclusive basis, as it does from Yeda. MD Anderson is the largest HSCT center in the United States, performing over 850 transplantations per year. MD Anderson is currently conducting a human clinical trial sponsored by Cell Source for its Anti-Viral Veto Cell. Professor Richard Champlin (who Chairs their Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and is a longtime associate and collaborator of Professor Reisner) serves as Principal Investigator for this trial.
 
Although Yeda has applied for and been granted various patents related to our technology, a granted patent only provides Yeda, and the Company by virtue of its exclusive license, the right to use the underlying invention. However, in order for our cell therapy and cancer therapy to be legally sold and administered to patients, the FDA or similar regulatory agencies must approve its use. In other words, having a patent provides legal “freedom to operate” for a certain technology, and may provide the ability to prevent others from using the same technology without the patent holder’s permission. However, in order to legally manufacture and distribute products, a company must go through all of the typical approval steps delineated in the “Overview” section above.
 
The following sections provide an overview of each platform. Further information on the underlying science is available upon written request and the execution of an appropriate nondisclosure agreement.
 
Our licensed technology portfolio consists of 15 patent families, 56 granted patents, 5 allowed/accepted patents and a further 43 pending patents. The following table lists the patents and patent applications that Yeda holds and which we have a license to use in each of the below-referenced countries:

Veto Cell Technology Platform
 
Background
 
Our Veto Cell technology is a next generation immunotherapy technology that enables the selective attenuation of the immune system. In other words, pre-clinical studies as well as initial human clinical trial results suggest that the treatment has the ability to reduce the immune response to selective “threats,” with low risk for adverse side effects.
 
What makes the Veto Cell approach distinctive is the degree to which it leverages the inherent specificity of the human immune system. The immune system defends the body by creating a specific stream of T-cell clones for each of millions of possible individual threats. A given T-cell will attack only its specific target, ignoring all other threats. Our technology might enable the physician to selectively attenuate immune response, thus effectively “switching-off” an individual stream of T-cell clones without affecting any other such streams of T-cell clones dispatched by the immune system to attack unwanted incursions.
 
The technology is based on the discovery that certain T-cells can acquire the property of attracting and proactively neutralizing immune attacks on them.
 
The technology has achieved distinctive results in animal live trial models. See, e.g., Eran Ophir et al. Murine anti-third party central-memory CD8+ promote hematopoietic chimerism under mild conditioning: lymph-node sequestration and deletion of anti-donor T cells, BLOOD, Feb. 14, 2013, at 1220; Towards off-the-shelf genetically modified T cells: prolonging functional engraftment in Mice by CD8 veto T cells, Leukemia 32, 2018; 1038-1040. Veto cells for safer nonmyeloablative haploidentical HSCT and CAR T cell therapy Seminars in Hematology 56, 2019; 173-182. It has also demonstrated both safety and efficacy thus far in human clinical trials. If it continues to succeed in human clinical trials, we believe that it may have meaningful and potentially broad impact on the field of stem cell transplantation:



1) | Significantly improve outcomes of transplantations by reducing the host (transplant recipient) rejection rate of T-cell depleted stem cells (e.g. from bone marrow) – thus supporting successful engraftment of the transplanted cells, which is the treatment for the blood cancer itself. In order to improve the safety of this cancer treatment, Veto Cell technology has shown in both preclinical studies and initial clinical data that it can markedly reduce both the risk of GvHD and the need for using aggressive amounts of immunosuppression medications, as well as, in preclinical studies and anticipated to be shown as clinical studies progress, preventing viral infections that typically threaten patients post transplantation. This safer means of deliver stem cell transplants would significantly reduce the HSCT mortality rate and therefore lead to broader use of this treatment. Furthermore, by adding CAR-T to the HSCT protocol, we can bridge between the initial transplantation and the conclusion of immune reconstitution, thus providing both short-term and ongoing protection against remission. This has the potential to significantly improve efficacy beyond that of the current outcomes of either CAR-T or HSCT on their own.

2) | Substantively increase the number of transplantations by enabling successful engraftment under lower levels of immune suppression and therefore making the therapy accessible to older and sicker patients (who today may not survive ablation). 
3) | Further increase the number of transplantations by making transplantation appropriate for other indications (for which today transplantation would be considered an inappropriately risky treatment). 

 
In addition, our Veto Cell technology may possibly play a role in the treatment of a number of serious and currently poorly treated non-malignant diseases. Finally, based on preclinical studies using genetically modified cells, we believe that Veto Cells will be able to act as critical enabler for other cell therapies, most notably CAR-T cell therapy, which has recently shown strong initial indications of being effective in the near term in treating blood cancer.

Yeda filed two patent applications that extend the usage of Veto Cell technology as a critical enabler for other cell therapy treatments. One patent application highlights, based on preclinical data, the ability of Veto Cells to accompany other cell therapy treatments and help them overcome rejection and avoid GvHD in an allogeneic treatment setting. The other patent application involves a genetically modified Veto Cell that can have sustained survival in the patient’s body while avoiding rejection and GvHD. These patents have both been granted in the United States Both of these, as well as a more recent patent application filed showing data which combines Veto Cells with CAR-T cells, highlight the potential to make CAR-T cells, which to date have been effective primarily in an autologous (patient’s own cells) setting, succeed in an allogeneic setting. What follows is a description of the significance of these two new patent applications:



- | Gene modified cell therapy is considered to be one of the most promising cancer treatment approaches in decades, with companies like Kite Pharma and JUNO Therapeutics having recently been acquired at multi-billion-dollar valuations after having successfully treated relatively small numbers of patients in clinical trials. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | While gene modified treatments such as CAR-T have shown remarkable results in cancer treatment trials, their published successes to date have been mostly limited to “autologous” blood cell cancer treatments using the patient’s own cells. There are concerns that this type of “personalized” treatment may not have favorable economics on a large-scale basis. 
- | The ideal, more lucrative commercial path for CAR-T and similar genetically engineered cell therapies is to become allogeneic or off the shelf product with drug-like distribution economics and to treat a broad spectrum of cancers including solid tumors. Allogene Therapeutics, an early-stage clinical company focused on allogeneic CAR-T, has attained a valuation of $6 billion, whereas Legend Biotech valuation reached $8 billion and Fate Therapeutics valuation attained the $10B level, underlining the importance of off-the-shelf CAR as a potential cancer treatment. Cell Source licenses Yeda’s patent applications for combining Veto Cells with genetically modified T cells and is currently exploring active collaboration with CAR-T cell providers to move Veto and CAR-T combined cell therapy towards the clinic. 
- | In the case of blood cancer treatment, we believe that a VETO CAR-T combined treatment will provide sustained protection for patients in relapse as well as a fundamentally superior approach for those in remission 

 
Cell Source has completed a collaboration, through its licensing agreement with Yeda, with Professor Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T cells. Professor Eshhar has served as both a scientist at the Weizmann Institute and on the Scientific Advisory Board of KITE Pharma. This collaboration confirmed the strength of combining Veto Cell technology with CAR-T cell therapy. Cell Source plans to introduce allogeneic VETO CAR-T HSCT combined cell treatment for lymphoma and leukemia and, eventually, off the shelf VETO CAR-T for these and other cancers, including solid tumors.
 
Furthermore, Yeda has filed a patent application, licensed to Cell Source, which was recently granted in the United States, as well as a new patent based on more advanced data, for an Anti-Viral Veto Cell. Below is an explanation of the potential for this application:
 

- | Other than primary disease (typically blood cell cancer) the leading causes of death in unrelated donor bone marrow transplants are rejection, GvHD, where the donor bone marrow rejects the host or recipient), and infections, which collectively are responsible for 35%-40% of deaths after haploidentical donor transplants within the first 100 days post-transplant. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | It is well established that GvHD can be prevented by T cell depletion of the bone marrow transplant. However, this procedure is also associated with an increased rate of graft rejection. Preclinical studies and initial clinical results suggest that this problem can be overcome by adding Veto Cells to the bone marrow transplant, as well as allowing for a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. However, viruses such as CMV and EBV remain a major threat to patients post-transplant. 
- | Cell Source has developed a next generation Veto Cell that not only facilitates mismatched transplants but also protects the transplant recipient against these common viruses. During the initial period after a stem cell transplantation the patient’s body undergoes an immune system reconstitution period. While the “new” immune system is building up, the patient is particularly vulnerable to viral infections, which develop in over 90% of bone marrow transplant recipients during the first 100 days post transplantation. Veto cells can fend off CMV and similar viral infection until such time as the patient’s own immune system reconstitutes to the point that it can fight off the infection on its own. 
- | Combining GvHD prevention by using T cell depleted transplants with anti-rejection action, under a mild conditioning regimen, as well as virus prevention, Veto Cell could potentially significantly increase survival rates post-transplant. Further adding the short-term cancer killing of CAR-T can combine to deliver even better long-term survival outcomes. 
- | Based on preclinical data, Veto Cells can also be used to facilitate organ transplants (e.g. kidney transplant combined with a bone marrow transplant) with partially mismatched donors and either reduce or eliminate the need for lifelong daily anti-rejection treatment currently given to even fully matched donor organ recipients.

Mechanism
 
Our Veto Cell is a CD8 central memory anti-3rd party T-cell that has five critical properties:



1) | It has an outer surface coating that triggers attack by specific host T-cells (and only those specific T-cells). 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | It can annihilate an attacking T-cell without itself being damaged (specifically, it exposes or releases a death-signaling molecule when an attacking T-cell binds to it). 
3) | It has been oriented to attack cells of a simulated third party (i.e., neither host nor donor), or a set of viral peptides, and thus exhibits markedly reduced risk of GvHD or graft rejection. 
4) | It is long-lived and endures in the body for extended periods. 
5) | It migrates to the thymus and lymph nodes. 

 
The outcome is that when a large number of these cells are introduced into the body, they effectively eliminate the T-cell clones that the immune system dispatches to attack the desirable, transplanted stem cells.
 
Thus, for example, if a population of Veto Cells is derived from a donor, they will express the same peptide as do the donor’s cells. Therefore, the specific stream of host T-cells that would ordinarily attack the donor stem cells, are instead directed to “decoy” Veto Cells and disabled before they reach the transplantation.
 
Described in a Blood editorial as a “substantial advance in Cell Therapy,” a notable characteristic of our Veto Cell is that this mechanism is quite specific. Only those specific T-cell clones that were generated to attack cells from this specific donor are disabled. The rest of the immune system essentially remains intact.
 
This is in marked contrast with conventional immunosuppression which degrades the entire immune system and is therefore associated with severe risk of infection and, in the case of stem cell transplantations, high mortality.
 
This effect is long-lived. Firstly, the Veto Cells themselves are long-lived memory cells. Secondly, when infused with stem cells the latter migrate to the thymus where, over time, they create a new “identity” in the host and initiate chimerism where the host and donor cells peacefully co-exist. This chimerism has the effect of “educating” new T-cells being generated by the thymus to tolerate donor cells and this tolerance can become permanent. Furthermore, by inducing permanent tolerance to donor cells, Veto Cells may be able to enable both acceptance (i.e. mitigate both host rejection and GvH rejection) and thus persistence (i.e. extended survival resulting in enhanced efficacy) of important cell therapy treatments such as CAR-T cells, TCRs and NK cells in treating both blood cell and solid tumor cancers. Beyond this, Veto Cells can be directed not only to kill host anti-donor rejecting cells, but also common viruses such as EBV and CMV that are a common cause of post-transplantation morbidity and mortality.
 
Target Indications
 
Our Veto Cell technology, an intravenously administered cell suspension, if successful, could initially be used in stem cell (e.g. bone marrow) transplantations and other treatments associated with malignant disorders (i.e., cancers). Veto Cell technology may also be applied to selected non-malignant conditions. The following sections provide a brief overview of the use of the Veto Cell technology in both of these scenarios.
i. Stem Cell Transplantation
 
In order to describe the effect of Veto Cells in transplantation, it is helpful to first briefly review the state of the art:
 
In a conventional stem cell transplant, the recipient first receives myeloablative conditioning - powerful chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy intended to destroy his/her own bone marrow cells. This has a threefold purpose:

1) | It destroys the host T-cells so they will not attack (reject) the donor bone marrow cells. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | It makes space in the host bone marrow for the new donor cells. 
3) | It destroys diseased host blood cells so that they do not proliferate and cause relapse following the procedure. 


19
--


In practice however, there are three major problems:
 

● | Host rejection - the myeloablative conditioning does not destroy all of the host T-cells. Those that remain may aggressively attack the donor bone marrow cells before they can engraft. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | GvHD - the transplanted cells include donor T-cells which recognize the host’s body as foreign and attack it. 
● | Infections are a common complication from HSCT and result in 26% of early patients deaths in haploidentical transplants of adult patients in the US. 

 
Rejection, GvHD and viral infections are all potentially life-threatening complications in and of themselves and also lead to the use of dangerous and costly immunosuppression medications.
 
ii. Veto Cell in Transplantation
 
The Veto Cell technology addresses not only rejection but also GvHD and infections. In a transplantation scenario, a population of donor Veto Cells is created to “escort” the stem cells when they are transplanted. This population is created by identifying donor cells with Veto Cell properties, exposing them to simulated 3rd party cells (e.g., selecting only those that react to a third person and therefore by definition will not react to either host or donor) or to viral peptides, and expanding their population in the lab.
 
The Veto Cells are then introduced into the host following the transplantation of the stem cells. The host mounts its normal immune response to the donor cells by generating a population of T-cell clones that will bind to any cells expressing markers from this specific donor. In a conventional transplantation, these T-cells would bind to and destroy donor stem-cells thus causing rejection of the transplant.
 
However, when the transplantation treatment involves a large number of Veto Cells, this rejection mechanism is “ambushed.” Since the Veto Cells express the same donor markers as the stem cells, the host T-cell clones will attempt to bind to the donor-derived Veto Cells as noted above, which act as decoys by attracting and then counterattacking and killing the clones before they ever reach the stem cell transplantation. These same Veto Cells concurrently attack viruses such as CMV and EBV which are a common source of infections that threaten HSCT patients. Based on additional preclinical data, in June of 2016 Yeda filed a U.S. provisional patent application, which has since been granted, and in 2019 a further patent application based on additional data, also licensed by Cell Source, which show the ability of Veto Cells to be directed against these types of viruses that typically cause infections in bone marrow transplant patients. This additional functionality, when combined with attacking host anti-donor rejecting cells, may even further enhance survival rates for patients.
 
iii. VETO CAR-T combined therapy
 
HSCT are well known to be an effective treatment for hematological malignancies. Making these treatments safer and more accessible by reducing the need for harmful immune suppression, avoiding GvHD and fending off common post-transplantation viruses are expected to facilitate, through successful Veto Cell treatments, a broader and more successful use of HSCT for not only the most severe cases, but also for older or weaker patients who are not capable of tolerating high intensity conditioning (high levels of radiation and chemotherapy). This is expected to significantly increase the number of patients who can receive successful cancer treatments that require allogeneic HSCT.
 
CAR-T cell therapy has shown strong cancer killing efficacy in the near term, mainly in an autologous setting. Longer term efficacy to date has been significantly lower, and to date there has been little success in establishing a successful approach to allogeneic CAR-T therapy. Having worked with Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T therapy, to combine the CAR-T cell and the Veto Cell in to single cell which both directly attacks cancer cells and facilitates T cell depleted HSCT under RIC, Cell Source intends to combine Veto Cell powered HSCT with CAR-T cell therapy for blood cell cancers into a single treatment, thus providing a comprehensive end-to-end solution which addresses both short-term cancer killing (via CAR-T) and long term relapse prevention (through a more safely delivered reconstituted immune system).
 
iv. Enabling Third Party Cell Therapies
 
Based on preclinical studies using genetically modified cells, in July of 2015 Yeda filed two U.S. provisional patent applications, both of which have since been granted in the United States, which are also licensed exclusively by Cell Source on a worldwide basis. These patent applications show the ability of Veto Cells to enhance the performance of cell therapy treatments involving genetically modified receptors. When combined with CAR-T or TCR cell therapy for example, these would potentially greatly enhance the ability of these treatments to be used in an allogeneic or “off the shelf” setting, and also increase their efficacy by avoiding both rejection and GvHD, thus increasing their persistence (survival in the patient’s body). A new patent, based on the Cell Source collaboration with Dr. Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T technology, showing the effectiveness of Veto Cells combined with CAR-T cell therapy, was filed by Yeda, under license to Cell Source, in 2020.
 
This combined VETO CAR-T or similar treatment (e.g. combining Veto with NK cells) is expected to result in broadly applicable effective treatments for both blood cell cancers and, eventually, a variety of solid tumor cancers as well.

v. In Non-Malignant Diseases
 
There are two major categories of non-malignant disorders that the Veto Cell technology aspires to address: organ transplantation and non-malignant hematological disorders.
 
In the case of organ transplantations and congenital non-malignant hematological disorders, the goal of the Veto Cells is to enable transplantation (stem cell or organ) by reducing host/donor immune system conflicts. This could potentially allow for mismatched (partial vs. full identity match between donor and host) kidney transplants, for example, and also obviate the need for lifelong daily anti-rejection medication which is the current standard of care. Such an outcome could improve quality of life, reduce cost of care and significantly increase life expectancy for a broader audience of prospective transplant recipients.
 
In the case of congenital non-malignant diseases such as sickle cell disease and aplastic anemia, the body’s bone marrow produces “flawed” cells. An effective treatment is HSCT which replaces the flawed host bone marrow with healthy donor cells. These cells then produce healthy blood cells, basically curing the anemia. As noted elsewhere however, today HSCT is a risky procedure because of the graft/host immune conflicts. It is therefore used infrequently to treat sickle cell disease. The Veto Cell tolerizing technology would increase the target population for this treatment by significantly reducing these conflicts and by extension the procedure’s risk. Yeda has filed patent applications, licensed to Cell Source, based on preclinical data that show Veto Cells’ effectiveness in reversing Sickle Cell Disease and their use in the treatment of T-cell mediated auto immune diseases such as preventing the development of Type 1 Diabetes.
 
Development Status
 
The Veto Cell platform has been extensively tested by in vitro studies (on both human and mouse disease) and confirmed in animal trials. The results appear to be consistently effective.
 
1. Inducing chimerism:
 
The following images show some example data from the Veto Cell animal studies. Skin of black mice has been grafted onto the backs of white mice. The data show that T-cells from host and donor mice are fully coexisting in the treatment group using the Veto Cells (“chimerism”).
 

2. Successful bone marrow transplantation under reduced levels of immune suppression:
 
The anti-rejection effect in the data below shows mice with lymphoma treated with Veto Cell therapy.
 
The control group mice (left side) all die by day 27. By contrast, the Veto Cell treatment group (right side) show far better results.

Administration
 
We envision that Veto Cell therapy will be administered in an in-patient setting, typically as part of the existing procedures involved with stem cell transplantations. Blood will be taken from the donor. The blood will be sent to a regional Company center where the Veto Cells will be developed and expanded - a process that lasts up to two weeks. The Veto Cells will then be sent to the transplantation center where they will be infused to the patient intravenously along with the transplantation.
Patent Status
 
Cell Source’s CD8 TcM (central memory T-cells) Veto Cell, are protected by granted patents in the US, Mexico, Europe, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Israel, India and the Russian Federation as well as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. More recent patent applications, including those for the Genetically Modified Veto Cell and the Anti-Viral Veto Cell have been granted in the US and are in the national phase in a broad set of jurisdictions.
Development Roadmap


The Veto Cell platform roadmap comprises two main programs as outlined in the table below. The specific clinical trials planned for each are detailed in the Clinical Trials section of this document.

Products and Services
 
Currently, we do not have any products, and there is no assurance that we will be able to develop any products.
 
The following products are currently planned:
 

1. | VETO CAR-T HSCT cell therapy for donor mismatched allogeneic stem cell transplantations for treatment of blood cancer. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This is our flagship (as an initial platform for increasing transplantation success) and is focused on haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantations. Treatment will comprise infusion of VETO CAR-T cells derived from the donor and processed in a Company (or subcontracted) facility that will be accessible to the transplantation center at the time of transplantation.
 

2. | Veto Cell based haploidentical organ transplantation initially for kidney and then also for liver transplants. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This therapy will involve a partially mismatched donor organ transplant followed by an Anti-Viral Veto powered HSCT using stem cells derived from the same donor.
 

3. | Off the shelf VETO CAR-T cell therapy. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This treatment would be use Veto Cells to increase persistence and hence efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy, without the use of HSCT, for blood cancers and eventually solid tumors as well.
 

4. | Veto Cell tolerance therapy for non-malignant disorders. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------

 
This is the application of Veto Cell technology to treatment of non-malignant (i.e., non-cancerous) diseases, as discussed in the Technology section. Target indications for Veto Cell therapy for nonmalignant disorders are likely to be: tolerizing therapy for allogeneic transplantations for sickle cell anemia and aplastic anemia (by using stem cell transplantations as referenced in no. 2 above) and tolerizing therapy for a broader range of congenital immune system related disorders, possibly including preventing the development of Type 1 Diabetes in Diabetes prone or early onset Diabetes patients.
 
Our Overall Development Status and Future Development Program
 
Prior to commercializing its products, the Company must conduct human clinical trials and obtain FDA approval and/or approvals from comparable foreign regulatory authorities.
 
Generally speaking, as a preclinical biotechnology firm, Cell Source needs to go through several necessary steps in order to commercialize its products and commence revenue generation. These steps are per product, but can run in parallel for multiple products, which are each in different stages of the development “pipeline”, so that, for example, when a certain product is already in a human clinical trial, another product may still be in preclinical development and a third may be awaiting regulatory approval to commence human trials. These can also take place in parallel, and varied stages, for the same product in different geographic jurisdictions. The typical steps per product (and range of time frame for each) are:

1) | Complete development of human treatment protocol (2-5 years) 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Apply for and receive approval to commence human trials (9-18 months) 
3) | Recruit patients (1-6 months) 
4) | Conduct Phase 1 trials showing safety of product (1-2 years) 
5) | Apply for and receive approval to conduct trials showing product efficacy (6-12 months) 
6) | Data collecting and analysis (6-12 months) 
7) | Conduct Phase 2 efficacy trials (2-3 years) 
8) | Data collecting and analysis (6-12 months) 
9) | Apply for and receive approval to conduct trials showing efficacy in larger numbers of patients (6-12 months) 
10) | Conduct Phase 3 efficacy trials with larger numbers of patients (2-4 years) 
11) | Data collecting and analysis (6-12 months) 
12) | Apply for and receive approval for production scale manufacturing facilities (6-12 months) 
13) | Contract third party or establish own production facilities (6-30 months) 
14) | Contract third party or establish own distribution platform (6-18 months) 
15) | Commence manufacturing and distribution (6-12 months)

Notably, steps 12-15 can be conducted in parallel with some of the steps above. In the case of Cell Source and other firms that treat terminal patients with either rare diseases or those for which there is currently no effective treatment, or where preclinical studies indicate a reasonable expectation to increase life expectancy and survival rates by a substantive margin, several of these steps can be combined and or shortened, subject to regulatory discretion. For example, Phase 1 and 2 (safety and efficacy) can be combined in a single concurrent step; approvals for subsequent steps can be accelerated; in some countries patients can already be treated commercially after the end of Phase 2, foregoing the requirement for Phase 3 data prior to commencing commercial treatments.
 
The specific detailed next steps the company must take to get the treatments or products to market include the following:
 
In the case of the Megadose Drug Combination, the Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit of the University of Parma in Italy on May 14, 2014 requested and on October 23, 2014 obtained approval from the Italian Medicine Association (the Italian equivalent of the U.S. FDA) to conduct human clinical trials using the “Megadose + Drug Combination.” While we are not mentioned in the application nor in the approval, we may indirectly benefit from the outcome of the trial, if successful, although we are not the sponsor of this trial. There are no written or verbal agreements between the hospital and Cell Source regarding the use of the technology. That said, Cell Source is aware and in favor of the hospital’s plans to use the technology and would of course find a positive initial outcome encouraging. Since the treatment is being done on compassionate grounds as a non-commercial clinical trial, there is no legal requirement for the hospital to obtain approval to use the treatment protocol. The hospital successfully treated the first cancer patient using the Megadose Drug Combination technology that Cell Source exclusively licenses from Yeda. The patient who was suffering from late-stage multiple myeloma, was released from hospital within a month of being treated and has since been cancer free for over seven years, with no GvHD, as initially reported in Blood Advances, vol. 1 no. 24 2166-2175 which was published online October 27, 2017.
 
While Cell Source was not a sponsor of the trial, the results provide a positive initial indication with respect to the technology. The patient received a bone marrow transplantation from a haploidentical or “mismatched” donor under a RIC regimen (i.e., a relatively low level of immune suppression treatment). There was successful initial engraftment of the transplantation in the absence of GvHD.
 
In November 2018, we executed a sponsored research agreement with MD Anderson, which was amended in December 2020 and in October 2021. The Company engaged MD Anderson to perform research services in the amount of approximately $1,500,000 from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 (approximately $500,000 each year for three years). The agreement was amended in December 2020 in order to increase the research budget for the year ending December 31, 2021 from approximately $500,000 to $800,000. In October 2021, the agreement was amended to extend the agreement by one year to November 27, 2022 and define the budget during such one-year period to be approximately $1,300,000.


In February 2019, we executed a second agreement with MD Anderson for the production of Veto Cells and the conducting of a Phase 1/2 FDA trial for the Anti-Rejection, Anti-Viral Veto Cell. The treatment protocol was submitted to the FDA by MD Anderson in February of 2019. Cell Source has conducted Veto Cell production development in cooperation with the Medical Center at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg in Germany.


For the Anti-Viral Veto Cell product candidate, MD Anderson is currently conducting a Phase 1/2 human clinical trial, sponsored by Cell Source. The trial has successfully completed the first treatment cohort, with 3 patients each receiving a haploidentical HSCT under reduced intensity conditioning with Veto Cells. This first in human dose optimization trial has thus far shown that the initial dose is in fact the optimal dose, as all three patients had successful stem cell engraftment after 42 days, in the absence of GvHD. Cell Source is now continuing the trial as it proceeds with additional cohorts of patients, using the same dose level. Cell Source anticipates that the US Phase 1/2 trial, once augmented with CAR-T cancer killing capability in the anticipated VETO CAR-T cell HSTC combined therapy, will last through 2023 or 2024. This would be followed by completion of a Phase 2 trial and Phase 3 trial, which could each last another 2-3 years. While under a fast track FDA program such as RMAT initial marketing approval could potentially be attained after a Phase 2 registration study as early as in 2025 or 2026, full approval, if successful, may not be attained until 2027 or later. Cell Source has concluded an initial proof-of-concept collaboration with Professor Zelig Eshhar, the inventor of CAR-T cell therapy, with respect to combining CAR-T cell therapy with Veto Cells. This is expected to lead to the augmentation of the existing Veto Cell treatment protocol at MD Anderson to include VETO CAR-T cells in 2022 or 2023, which may lead to fast track approval by 2025 or 2026 but may last until 2027 or 2028.
 
As referenced above, it is possible that Cell Source treatments could qualify for any or all of Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, RMAT or Priority Review designation under the FDA, which would hasten their approval if successful. The estimated costs for each step of development, in terms of clinical trials, are delineated below:
 
Cell Source estimates the cost of clinical trials alone to be at least $5 million over the coming two years and overall company financing requirements of at least $50 million in order to reach commercialization for the Veto Cell products. This would mean that Cell Source will need to secure one or more significant capital infusions in order to reach the point that meaningful revenues could be generated.

The following table summarizes the development plan through 2026:
 

Competition
 
In the area of allogeneic HSCT and related GvHD and virus management, our competitors include: the so-called “Baltimore” protocol, which employs a T-cell replete approach under RIC; companies who which have been focused on reducing GvHD in a T-cell depleted setting, with high intensity conditioning (e.g. Bellicum); companies working to treat GvHD after it occurs (e.g. Abbvie, Incyte and Kadmon); and finally cell therapy companies developing anti-viral treatments (e.g. Atara, Allovir). In the area of CAR-T cell therapy, our competitors include allogeneic CAR-T companies (e.g. Allogene, Legend, Fate) and autologous CAR-T focused players (e.g. Novartis, Gilead (KITE), BMS/Celgene (JUNO)).
 
Haploidentical HSCT is gaining popularity in the US, outflanking UCB (umbilical cord blood) and growing more quickly than MUD (matched unrelated donor) based transplants. In the US, the majority of haploidentical HSCT are performed under RIC, mostly using T- cell replete transplants with post-transplant cyclophosphamide treatment. While this “Baltimore” RIC approach has gained popularity (mainly due to safety reasons) – as a T-cell replete approach it carries the risk of marked GvHD. Although some T-cell depleted approaches have shown reductions in GvHD, they face significant safety issues due to their aggressive use of immune suppression. Similarly, while currently approved CAR-T therapy for blood cancer has shown compelling short-term efficacy, the initial longer term data have shown a marked drop off in overall survival rates. Cell Source’s planned distinctive combination of a T-cell depleted HSCT with RIC, complemented by anti-viral activity and enhanced by CAR-T short-term cancer killing, aims to provide the “best of both worlds” with safer, more effective HSTC leading to a reconstituted immune system, supported by “bridging” CAR-T remission induction and relapse prevention during the immune reconstitution period.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. While our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our own products, we believe that if our human trials show efficacy at the same levels of our animal trials, we would have the potential to develop at least a niche market share. Also, a number of large US cancer centers such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Fred Hutchinson in Seattle, City of Hope in Duarte, CA and Dana Farber in Boston are conducting clinical trials and providing treatments on a compassionate care basis that can be funded on a not for profit basis and provide competition to Cell Source.

We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our capacity to:
 

● | successfully complete adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that demonstrate statistically significant safety and efficacy and to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | effectively use patents and possibly exclusive partnership agreements with important third-party treatment providers and collaboration partners to maintain a stable competitive stance for our Technology; 
● | attract and retain appropriate clinical and commercial personnel and service providers; and 
● | establish adequate distribution relationships for our products. 

 
Failure in efficiently developing and executing these capabilities may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Strategy Overview
 
Our strategy is based on two underlying drivers: (a) that animal studies (supported by initial human data) show Veto Cell technology to be consistently effective and have advantages over competitors; and (b) that the lead indications (the most common blood cancers) are relatively common, have high mortality and have limited treatment options today.
 
Based on the foregoing drivers, we have developed a business plan with the objective of obtaining regulatory approvals and subsequently launching product sales with a focus on the United States, Europe and Asia.
 
Key Strategy Elements
 
We are pursuing a staged entry strategy. The first several years will be narrowly focused, both in terms of market segments (blood cancers, kidney disease) and products (VETO CAR-T and VETO Organ Transplants).
 
Subsequently, we plan to broaden the segmentation strategy to include, stand-alone cancer treatments without HSCT (e.g. for solid tumors) and additional HSCT indications (e.g. selected genetic non-malignant diseases).
 
Our strategy can be summarized as follows:
 

Strategy Element | Introductory period (years 1 -3 post FDA approval) | Years 4+ 
-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Market Segments | ● Lymphoma and leukemia ● Multiple myeloma ● Kidney disease | ● Same as before plus solid tumor cancer targets, liver failure, sickle cell anemia beta thalassemia, diabetes and other non-malignant hematological disorders; 
Product Rollout | ● VETO CAR-T (with or without HSCT) for B-cell malignancies ● Veto Cell Kidney transplants | ● VETO CAR-T for solid tumors ● Veto Cell liver transplants ● Veto HSCT for non-malignant disorders 
Customer/ Geographic Focus | ● United States ● Western Europe ● China | ● Major markets worldwide 
Channels/Go to Market | ● Direct relationships with leading transplantation centers ● Partnerships with global pharma players | ● Out-licensing to, or outright acquisition by, global pharma players 
Pricing | ● Consistent with other cell therapy offerings currently associated with transplantations and immuno-oncology | ● Potentially higher volume, lower cost for “off the shelf” offerings 
Operations | ● Three production centers: - US - Western Europe - Far East ● Initial capacity leased from or situated adjacent to major transplantation center. | ● Regional production centers owned outright or JV with partners

Segment Selection
 
Within the general market for immune therapies, we have selected target market segments (i.e., medical conditions) for initial focus based on two (2) key criteria: 
 

1) | Severity of unmet medical need: degree of severity of the indication and the effectiveness of existing treatments. These criteria help determine the proper regulatory pathway. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Technology relevance: relative value of the ability to manage immune response to the treatment of a given indication. 

 
We will initially focus on indications that score highly with respect to both criteria (e.g., blood cancers, kidney failure). These conditions may qualify for Fast Track status with the FDA, and, due to the cost and relative efficacy of current treatment alternatives, could potentially support profitable price points for effective new treatments.
 
Product Rollout
 
Cell Source plans to seek approval initially in the US and Europe and, in parallel but with a delayed start, in China and possibly Japan. A successful first-in-human Phase 1/2 trial in the US, which could be concluded by 2023 or 2024, would serve as a strong foundation for trials in other countries. Limited sales on a “compassionate grounds” basis may, depending on qualification for Breakthrough Therapy or other Accelerated Approval designation, commence as early as 2025 or 2026. Full approval by the FDA in the U.S. can take as long as 8 years, or until 2028.
 
Future products may include VETO CAR-T HSCT combined cell therapy for allogeneic stem cell transplantations as well as Veto Cell based organ transplantation. Following the initial market penetration and establishment of solid market positioning, we plan to broaden the product offering to address a wider variety of indications which may include custom Veto Cell developments for specific collaborations with other cell therapy treatments. For example, we believe that one area in which we could broaden our product offerings is to utilize our Veto Cell technology, if successful in humans, to address the rejection problems being faced by companies developing NK, TCR and similar cell therapy products, as an enabler for these treatments to help them overcome some of the rejection and persistence related performance issues their technology currently seems to be facing. If our Veto Cell technology proves to be successful in humans, we plan to continue to explore such potential applications in the future.
 
Customer/Geographic Focus
 
Assuming positive clinical trials, we will initially focus our sales efforts of Veto Cell anti-rejection therapy on centers dealing with late-stage B-cell malignancies. High profile, high volume HSCT facilities can be targeted to market this treatment.
 
Current plans are to introduce the products first in North America and Western Europe, and, perhaps concurrently, in China. Focusing on key transplantation facilities in target geographic markets will allow us to both refine the administration of our products and bolster our reputation in both these and a broader set of geographic markets.
 
After the introductory period, we plan to expand activities in these initial markets while simultaneously broadening geographic coverage. In Stage 2, we plan to initiate active marketing efforts in the remaining Western European countries, Japan, Australia, and possibly Russia and India.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
The initial target market is concentrated and networked. It comprises the approximately 100 leading transplantation centers in the target geographies. As discussed in the “Market Access” and “Channels” section, these centers are well connected to each other and tend to quickly share innovations and best practices.
 
The planned penetration strategy is to introduce Veto Cell into the best-known and most influential centers in North America and Western Europe, and benefit from the exposure and industry leadership provided by these centers.
 
This initial penetration strategy includes incorporating some of these centers into clinical trials so as to expose and involve their medical leadership.


In the longer term, we plan to drive use and awareness within and across the broader oncology community in order to encourage oncologists to refer their patients to centers that already use our products and therapies and to encourage pull-influence on additional centers to adopt our products and therapies.
 
The broader provider community will be addressed both through a presence in leading peer-reviewed publications and by attending conferences where research and best clinical practices are shared, seminars are conducted, and networking opportunities are provided for the physicians. Furthermore, a dedicated sales force will approach leading bone marrow transplant physicians in the United States, as well as other key points of contact at the leading HSCT centers in the US as referenced above.

Operating Strategy
 
Veto Cell doses are to be prepared by Cell Source facilities or qualified production partners. This is to both protect trade secrets and directly control quality during the initial stages.
 
The graphic below outlines the general operating model in each geographic market.
 

Patient care facilities send frozen cells to a Cell Source processing center. Most likely, the first processing center will consist of lab space leased from or adjacent to a large transplantation center, such as MD Anderson in Texas. Such a transplantation center has appropriate equipment and infrastructure, along with available production capacity, and will also represent an immediate market for our offerings for use in their own procedures. The Cell Source processing center processes the cells and sends the treated cells and appropriate protocols back to the caregiver for infusion at time of transplantation.
 
In the introductory post regulatory approval phase, we plan on establishing one center in the U.S., one in Western Europe (most likely Germany), and one in the Far East. Specific locations and timing are to be determined. Initially, we plan to outsource production capacity from existing facilities operated by Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMO) adjacent to large hospitals, or, where capacity is available, contract directly with major cancer treatment centers who have accredited GMP facilities and experienced cell production staff for Veto Cell production. Subsequently, sales from these centers can justify and fund stand-alone facilities.
 
The general goal of the initial centers is to support the FDA process, provide full coverage for the North American and European markets, and provide access to the Chinese market. Following the introductory period in each respective market, we may elect to migrate the production facilities from leased space in transplantation center laboratories or contract services with specialized CMOs to company-owned stand-alone facilities.
 
In general, we assume a capital cost per stand-alone production facility of at least $10 million. This estimate is based, in part, on the projected high costs of GMP “clean rooms,” each of which can cost $1 million to set up. We will need to obtain financing in order to fund the setup of such facilities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

Clinical Trials Overview
 
We will initially focus our clinical trials on stem cell transplantation for patients suffering from blood cancers (lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma), for which our Veto Cell technology constitutes a potential breakthrough. These indications have unmet needs as evidenced by the valuations of leading CAR-T players who thus far have chiefly presented data treating these diseases.
 
We commenced our first Phase 1/2 clinical trial in late 2019. This trial combines traditional Phase 1 safety with Phase 2 efficacy inasmuch as it is a safety trial conducted on sick patients, so as to both establish safety and show initial indications of efficacy concurrently. The goal is to demonstrate safety and initial efficacy in several indications. Management has structured the trials such that an additional goal of showing initial markers pointing to successful engraftment, in the absence of GvHD, while preventing viral infections, already within Phase 1/2.
 
The chart below provides an overview of the current trials plan, which can of course vary based on both finalization of human protocols and timing or regulatory approvals:
 

Trial Plans
 
Trials are planned for the US and Europe. The current initial US trial plans to treat 24 patients. We plan to focus on haploidentical (donor mismatched) stem cell bone transplantation under reduced intensity conditioning (reduced levels of immune suppression treatment) for B-cell malignancies and possibly non-malignant indications (e.g. sickle cell disease). We are currently conducting preclinical trials for VETO CAR-T cell therapy. Once we complete a proof of concept, we plan to augment the current clinical trial protocol for blood cell cancer to include VETO CAR-T cells, and to develop an Off-the-shelf VETO CAR-T treatment, without a stem cell transplant, for patients in relapse. In the future, we plan to conduct clinical trials for solid tumor patients as well. Also, once we have shown safety and efficacy for Veto Cell based stem cell transplants, we plan to combine these with haploidentical kidney transplants in patient trials.
Regulatory Issues Overview


We are seeking regulatory approval from the U.S. FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in Europe and plan to approach similar agencies elsewhere for approvals to both produce and sell our products.
 
We commenced a 24 patient human clinical trials for Anti-Viral Veto Cells, our lead product candidate, in the US in late 2019.

Regulatory Process and Expectations


We have developed and will continue to develop our clinical trial protocols with the support of highly experienced medical practitioners who have vast experience in working with their local regulators. MD Anderson, for example, as the largest stem cell transplantation center and leading cancer treatment facility in the US, has a thoroughgoing internal protocol approval process which serves to refine every aspect of each patient protocol, in great detail, in anticipation of any potential issues that the FDA would typically wish to see addressed.
 
The clinical trials outlined in the previous section are designed to lead to regulatory approval for Veto Cell-based therapy in treating blood cancers and stem cell transplantation applications and, thereafter, solid organ transplantations and, eventually, solid tumor cancers.
 
Interim Revenue Opportunities
 
While our focus is to conclude Phase 3 approval for cancer treatments, the Company is also exploring complementary shorter-term opportunities for generating revenue before additional FDA approvals are received, namely:

1) | Treating patients after the end of Phase 2 (based on US Fast Track approvals and/or European Marketing Authorization Approvals) with either partial or full insurance reimbursement available); and 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Potential upfront and milestone driven licensing revenues from collaborations with third parties. 

Intellectual Property
 
Pursuant to the Yeda License Agreement, Yeda granted the Company an exclusive worldwide license to certain patents, discoveries, inventions and other intellectual property generated (together with others) by Professor Yair Reisner at the Immunology Department at the Weizmann Institute. Under the Yeda License Agreement, the Company grants Yeda a 4% royalty on sales of patented products. Cell Source is required to pay Yeda a $50,000 annual license fee until such time as payment of royalties commences. The Yeda License Agreement also requires the Company to proceed with the development of the technologies on a timely basis. 
 
The license period (per product, per country) is for the full life of the patents and expires at the later of the patent expiration date in that country or 15 years after the date that the FDA or local equivalent regulatory authority in each country approves that particular product for sale in that country. As long as Cell Source sponsors research or pays either a nominal license fee of $50,000 per year (total for use of all the products) or royalties on product sales on at least one product as per the license agreement, the license will remain in effect continuously and expire only with the expiration of the patent or 15 years after regulatory approval (later of the two) per product per country as described above. Cell Source voluntarily sponsors Research at the Weizmann Institute for the sake of developing its products and treatments from initial invention through to finalization of human treatment protocols.
 
The agreement with Yeda, as amended most recently on December 2, 2021, includes certain development milestones. If the Company fails to achieve any one of the milestones set forth in the Yeda License Agreement (as per the current amended version) which are listed below, then Yeda will be entitled to (i) modify the related license such that it will become non-exclusive or (ii) terminate the Yeda License Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice:



a. | by January 1, 2025, to have commenced Phase 2 clinical trials with respect to a Product; provided that in the interim the company continues to substantively sponsor research and clinical trials; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | by January 1, 2028, to have either commenced Phase 3 clinical trials or to have received FDA or EMA marketing approval in a respect of a Product (“Marketing Approval”); 
c. | within 12 (twelve) months from the date of Marketing Approval, to have made a First Commercial Sale of a Product; or 
d. | in case commercial sale of any Product having commenced, there shall be a period of 12 (twelve) months or more during which no sales of any Product shall take place by the Company or its Sublicensees (except as a result of force majeure or other factors beyond the control of the Company). 

 
Additionally, the Yeda License Agreement also provides that:
 

○ | Title. All right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Information and the Patents (as those terms are defined in the Yeda License Agreement) and all right, title and interest in and to any drawings, plans, diagrams, specifications, other documents, models, or any other physical matter in any way containing, representing or embodying any of the foregoing, vest and shall vest in Yeda and subject to the license granted in the Yeda License Agreement. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | Patents. Both Yeda and the Company shall consult with one another on the filing of patent applications for any portion of Licensed Information and/or corresponding to patent application existing at the time the Yeda License Agreement was executed. Yeda shall retain outside patent counsel that will be approved by Cell Source, to prepare, file and prosecute patent applications. All applications will be filed in Yeda’s name.

○ | Patents; Patent Infringements. Where the Company determines that a third party is infringing one or more of the Patents or is sued, in prosecuting or defending such litigation, the Company must pay any expenses or costs or other liabilities incurred in connection with such litigation (including attorney’s fees, costs and other sums awarded to the counterparty in such action). The Company agreed to indemnify Yeda against any such expenses or costs or other liabilities.

○ | License. With regard to the expiration of Patents, a Product is deemed to be covered by a Patent so long as such Product is protected by “Orphan Drug” status (or the like). The Company has an exclusive worldwide license under the Licensed Information and the Patents for the development, manufacture and sales of the Products. License remains in force in each country with respect to each Product until the later of (i) the expiration of the last Patent in such country covering such Product or (ii) the expiration of a 15-year period commencing the day FDA New Drug Approval is received for a Product in such country. 

 
The Company may grant a Sublicense only with Yeda’s prior written consent, which shall not be withheld unreasonably provided that:
 

i. | the proposed Sublicense is for monetary consideration only; 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | the proposed Sublicense is to be granted in a bona fide arm’s length commercial transaction; 
iii. | a copy of the agreement granting the Sublicense and all amendments thereof shall be made available to Yeda, 14 days before their execution and Cell Source shall submit to Yeda copies of all such Sublicenses and all amendments thereof promptly upon execution thereof; and 
iv. | the proposed Sublicense is made by written agreement, the provisions of which are consistent with the terms of the License and contain, inter alia, the following terms and conditions, including: the Sublicense shall expire automatically on the termination of the License for any reason. 

 
However, Yeda’s prior written consent is not needed if the sublicense is limited to China, and the Company grants it to a Chinese affiliated entity of the Company.
 

○ | Termination. The Yeda License Agreement terminates on the later of: (i) the expiration of the last of the Patents or (ii) the expiry of a continuous period of 20 years during which there shall not have been a First commercial sale of any product in any country. Yeda may terminate by written notice, effective immediately, if the Company challenges the validity of any of the Patents. If a challenge is unsuccessful, then in addition to Yeda’s right to termination, the Company shall pay to Yeda liquidated damages in the amount of $8,000,000. Either the Company or Yeda may terminate the Yeda License Agreement and the License by serving a written notice upon (i) occurrence of a material breach or (ii) the granting of a winding-up order. Additionally, Yeda may terminate for failure to reimburse Yeda for patent application and/or prosecution expenses.

Our technology portfolio includes a patented platform termed “Veto Cell” (more formally described as “Anti 3rd party central memory T cell”), which is an immune tolerance biotechnology that enables the selective blocking of immune responses.
 
For a list of all the patents and pending patents that Yeda holds and which we have a license to use, please refer to the table in the section entitled “Science and Technology Overview” above.
 
Patents & Proprietary Rights
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our existing product candidates and the products we acquire or license by obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position. To develop and maintain our position, we intend to continue relying upon patent protection, orphan drug status, Hatch-Waxman exclusivity, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities. We intend to seek patent protection whenever available for any products or product candidates and related technology we acquire in the future.
 
We may also seek orphan drug status whenever it is available. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. and Canada, and 10 years in the EU. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for a different clinical indication.

It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and may not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
We submitted our first IND application to the FDA, which was done on our behalf by MD Anderson, in February 2019. Cell Source itself has not had any contact with any regulator anywhere regarding treatment approvals or clinical trials associated with regulatory approvals. We are aware that a hospital in Italy has independently requested and received approval to conduct a trial with a treatment protocol the patents for which we license from Yeda, which today forms part of the broader protocol that we plan to use in the US and European clinical trials, but we are not mentioned in the application nor in the approval. However, we may indirectly benefit from the outcome of the trial, if successful, although we are not the sponsor of this trial. There are no written or verbal agreements between the hospital and Cell Source regarding the use of the technology. That said, Cell Source is aware and in favor of the hospital’s plans to use the technology and would find a positive initial outcome encouraging. Since the treatment is being done on compassionate grounds as a non-commercial clinical trial, there is no legal requirement for the hospital to obtain approval to use the treatment protocol.
 
Cell Source commenced a human clinical trial, conducted on its behalf by MD Anderson, in 2019 to show initial safety, and possibly efficacy, results in the US.
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor, affecting the cost and time of our research and product development activities, and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of any approved products. All of our products require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, our products are subject to rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, reporting, labeling, transport and storage, record keeping and marketing of our products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, the necessary regulatory approvals could harm our business.
 
The regulatory requirements relating to the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products may change from time to time and this may impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and the ability of independent investigators to conduct their own research with support from us.
 
The clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to regulation by various authorities in the U.S., the EU and other countries, including, in the U.S., the FDA, in Canada, Health Canada, and, in the EU, the EMA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act in the U.S. and numerous directives, regulations, local laws and guidelines in Canada and the EU and elsewhere govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
Regulatory approval will be required in all the major markets in which we seek to develop our products. At a minimum, approval requires the generation and evaluation of data relating to the quality, safety, and efficacy of an investigational product for its proposed use. The specific types of data required and the regulations relating to this data will differ depending on the territory, the treatment candidate involved, the proposed indication and the stage of development.
 
In general, new cell compositions are tested in animals until adequate evidence of safety is established to support the proposed clinical study protocol designs. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical into either healthy human volunteers or patients with the disease (typically 20 to 50 subjects), the emphasis is on testing for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population (typically 50 to 200 patients) to determine the initial efficacy of the pharmaceutical for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a treatment protocol shows preliminary evidence of some efficacy and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes in a larger patient population in adequate and well-controlled studies designed to yield statistically sufficient clinical data to demonstrate efficacy and safety.

In the U.S., specific pre-clinical data, manufacturing and chemical data, as described above, need to be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which, unless the FDA objects, will become effective thirty (30) days following receipt by the FDA. Phase 1 studies in human volunteers may commence only after the application becomes effective. Prior regulatory approval for human healthy volunteer studies is also required in member states of the EU. Currently, in each member state of the EU, following successful completion of Phase 1 studies, data are submitted in summarized format to the applicable regulatory authority in the member state in respect of applications for the conduct of later Phase 2 studies. In many places in Europe, a two-tiered approval system mandates approval at the regional level prior to applying for national approval. Regional approval cycle times, including multiple iterations where questions are answered and the specific details of the protocol may be fine-tuned, can last several months prior to applying to the national (federal government level) regulator. The national regulatory authorities in the EU typically have between one and three months in which to raise any objections to the proposed study, and they often have the right to extend this review period at their discretion. In the U.S., following completion of Phase 1 studies, further submissions to regulatory authorities are necessary in relation to Phase 2 and 3 studies to update the existing IND. Authorities may require additional data before allowing the studies to commence and could demand that the studies be discontinued at any time if there are significant safety issues. In addition to the regulatory review, a study involving human subjects has to be approved by an independent body. The exact composition and responsibilities of this body will differ from country to country. In the U.S., for example, each study will be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board at each institution at which the study is conducted. This board considers among other things, the design of the study, ethical factors, the privacy of protected health information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the safety of the human subjects and the possible liability risk for the institution. Equivalent rules to protect subjects’ rights and welfare apply in each member state of the EU, where one or more independent ethics committees, which typically operate similarly to an institutional review board, will review the ethics of conducting the proposed research. These ethical review committees typically exist at the regional level, where approval is required prior to applying for national approval. Other regulatory authorities around the rest of the world have slightly differing requirements involving both the execution of clinical trials and the import/export of pharmaceutical products. It is our responsibility to ensure we conduct our business in accordance with the regulations of each relevant territory.
 
By leveraging existing pre-clinical and clinical data, we are seeking to build upon an existing pre-clinical safety and efficacy database to accelerate our research. In addition, our focus on an end-stage population which has limited current treatment options may result in relatively shorter approval cycle times. Approval by the FDA in this category generally has been based on objective response rates and duration of responses rather than demonstration of survival benefit. As a result, trials of drugs to treat end-stage refractory cancer indications have historically involved fewer patients and generally have been faster to complete than trials of drugs for other indications. We are aware that the FDA and other similar agencies are regularly reviewing the use of objective endpoints for commercial approval and that policy changes may impact the size of trials required for approval, timelines and expenditures significantly. The trend over the past few years has been to shorten approval cycles for terminal patients in the U.S. by employing a “fast track” approach.
 
In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit a dossier to the relevant authority for review, which is known in the U.S. as an NDA and in the EU as a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The format is usually specific and laid out by each authority, although in general it will include information on the quality of the chemistry, manufacturing and pharmaceutical aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. Once the submitted NDA is accepted for filing by the FDA, it undertakes the review process that takes ten (10) months, unless an expedited priority review is granted which takes six (6) months to complete. Approval can take several months to several years, if multiple ten (10) month review cycles are needed before final approval is obtained, if at all.
 
The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. The NDA may be approvable requiring additional pre-clinical, manufacturing data or clinical trials which may be requested at the end of the ten (10) month NDA review cycle, thereby delaying marketing approval until the additional data are submitted and may involve substantial unbudgeted costs. The regulatory authorities usually will conduct an inspection of relevant manufacturing facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product. An inspection of the clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure. As a condition of marketing approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects or other additional studies as deemed appropriate. After approval for the initial indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.
 
The FDA offers a number of regulatory mechanisms that provide expedited or accelerated approval procedures for selected drugs in the indications on which we are focusing our efforts. These include accelerated approval under Subpart H of the agency’s NDA approval regulations, fast track drug development procedures and priority review. At this time, we have not determined whether any of these approval procedures will apply to any of our current treatment candidates.
 
The US, EU and other jurisdictions may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which, in the US, is generally a disease or condition that affects no more than 200,000 individuals. In the EU, orphan drug designation can be granted if: the disease is life threatening or chronically debilitating and affects no more than fifty (50) in 100,000 persons in the EU; without incentive it is unlikely that the drug would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and no satisfactory method of treatment for the condition exists or, if it does, the new drug will provide a significant benefit to those affected by the condition. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the U.S. and ten (10) years in the EU. Orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the same indication or the same drug for different indications. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or MAA. After orphan drug designation is granted, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed. Orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the review and approval process; however, this designation provides an exemption from marketing authorization (NDA) fees.

We are also subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use and disposal of hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with and any violation of these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, accidental contamination or injury from these materials may occur. Compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or our competitive position. However, we are not able to predict the extent of government regulation, and the cost and effect thereof on our competitive position, which might result from any legislative or administrative action pertaining to environmental or safety matters.
 
In various countries, animal rights activism has led to either formal or informal boycotting of certain types of animal trials. This may have an adverse impact on our business as we rely on animal experiments as precursors to human trials.
 
Employees
 
Other than our Chief Executive Officer, we currently do not have any full-time employees, but retain the services of independent contractors/consultants on a contract-employment basis. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our management systems and to recruit and train new employees. Although we have done so in the past and expect to do so in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel. We anticipate that in the near future, other key personnel will enter into employment agreements with the Company on customary terms.
