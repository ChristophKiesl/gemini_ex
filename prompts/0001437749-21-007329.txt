Item 1. Business
 
Development of the Business
 
Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Navidea,” the “Company,” or “we”), a Delaware corporation (NYSE American: NAVB), is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of precision immunodiagnostic agents and immunotherapeutics. Navidea is developing multiple precision-targeted products based on our Manocept™ platform to enhance patient care by identifying the sites and pathways of undetected disease and enable better diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making and targeted treatment.
 
Navidea’s Manocept platform is predicated on the ability to specifically target the CD206 mannose receptor expressed on activated macrophages. The Manocept platform serves as the molecular backbone of Tc99m tilmanocept, the first product developed and commercialized by Navidea based on the platform. Other than Tc99m tilmanocept, which the Company has a license to distribute outside of Canada, Mexico and the United States, none of the Company’s drug product candidates have been approved for sale in any market.
 
Our business is focused on two primary types of drug products: (i) diagnostic substances, including Tc99m tilmanocept and other diagnostic applications of our Manocept platform, and (ii) therapeutic development programs, including therapeutic applications of our Manocept platform. See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information about our business segments.
 
History
 
We were originally incorporated in Ohio in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1988. From inception until January 2012, we operated under the name Neoprobe Corporation. In January 2012, we changed our name to Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. in connection with both the sale of our medical device business and our strategic repositioning as a precision medicines company focused on the development and commercialization of precision diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals. Since our inception, the majority of our efforts and resources have been devoted to the research and clinical development of radiopharmaceutical technologies primarily related to the intraoperative diagnosis and treatment of cancers.
 
Beginning in late 2011, the Company in-licensed two neuro-tracer product candidates, NAV4694 and NAV5001. The Company advanced the development of both product candidates over the course of 2012 through 2014, moving both into Phase 3 clinical trials. However, in May 2014, the Navidea Board of Directors announced that the Company would restructure its development efforts to focus on cost effective development of the Manocept platform and divest its neuro-tracer product candidates. In April 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Alseres Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Alseres”) to terminate the NAV5001 sublicense agreement. In January 2021, the Company executed an agreement with Alseres and LikeMinds, Inc. (“LikeMinds”), pursuant to which Alseres assigned its obligations under the previous sublicense and termination agreements, including certain milestone and royalty payments, to LikeMinds. In April 2018, the Company executed an agreement to provide Meilleur Technologies, Inc. (“Meilleur”) worldwide rights to conduct research using NAV4694, as well as an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of NAV4694 in Australia, Canada, China, and Singapore. Meilleur also has an option to commercialize worldwide.
 
In December 2014, we announced the formation of a new business unit to further explore therapeutic applications for the Manocept platform, which was incorporated as Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc. (“MT”) in January 2015 as a majority-owned subsidiary of Navidea. Navidea also granted MT an exclusive sublicense for certain therapeutic applications of the Manocept technology.  MT developed processes for producing the first two therapeutic Manocept immuno-constructs, MT-1002, which is designed to specifically target and kill activated CD206+ macrophages by delivering doxorubicin, and MT-2002, which is designed to inhibit the inflammatory activity of activated CD206+ macrophages by delivering a potent anti-inflammatory agent. Effective March 1, 2019, Navidea terminated the sublicense to MT in accordance with its terms due to MT’s insolvency. Since then, Navidea has continued the development of therapeutic products based on the Manocept platform. We have contracted with independent facilities to produce sufficient quantities of the MT-1002 and MT-2002 agents along with the concomitant analytical standards, to provide material for preclinical animal studies and future clinical trials.
 
Technology and Product Candidates
 
Our primary development efforts over the last several years were focused on diagnostic products, including Tc99m tilmanocept, which the Company has a license to distribute outside of Canada, Mexico and the United States. Our more recent initiatives have been focused on diagnostic and therapeutic line extensions based on our Manocept platform.

During the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company’s primary concern is the safety of its employees, the employees of its clinical trial sites, and the patients enrolled in its clinical trials. The Company is working hard to mitigate any safety risk along with any long-term impact on its clinical development programs. The spread of COVID-19 has impacted the global economy and our operations, including the interruption of our clinical trial activities in Europe. For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has delayed enrollment in our NAV3-32 clinical study in the United Kingdom due to national COVID-19-related shutdowns. Navidea has completed enrollment and imaging events in Arms 1, 2 and 3 of the Company’s ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial (NAV3-31) and delivered interim data. The Company’s pivotal Phase 3 trial for rheumatoid arthritis (NAV3-33) also remains on track for a second-half 2021 launch. The second Phase 2b trial (NAV3-32) correlating Tc99m tilmanocept uptake in rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”)-involved joints with CD206 immunohistochemistry findings from synovial biopsies has received approval at both Northwestern University and in the United Kingdom and recruitment has begun at Northwestern. In addition, the investigator-initiated Phase 2 cardiovascular (“CV”) study is nearing completion at Massachusetts General Hospital. Results provided to date have paralleled data in our earlier published article, and these data are supportive of Navidea’s hypothesis that tilmanocept can provide marked signal to background in a host of CV disease applications. Navidea continues to anticipate meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the coming months to discuss upcoming clinical trial designs.
 
Manocept Platform - Diagnostics and Therapeutics Background
 
Navidea’s Manocept platform is predicated on the ability to specifically target the CD206 mannose receptor expressed primarily on activated macrophages. This flexible and versatile platform serves as a molecular backbone for purpose-built targeted imaging molecules that may significantly impact patient care by providing enhanced diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making, and target-specific treatment. This CD206-targeted drug platform is applicable to a range of diagnostic modalities, including single photon emission computed tomography (“SPECT”), positron emission tomography (“PET”), gamma-scanning and intra-operative and/or optical-fluorescence detection, as well as delivery of therapeutic compounds that target macrophages, and their role in a variety of immune- and inflammation-involved diseases. The FDA-approved sentinel node/lymphatic mapping agent, Tc99m tilmanocept, is representative of the ability to successfully exploit this mechanism to develop powerful new products and to expand this technology into additional diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
 
Activated macrophages play important roles in many disease states and are an emerging target in many diseases where diagnostic uncertainty exists. Impairment of the macrophage-driven disease mechanisms is an area of increasing and proven focus in medicine. The number of people affected by all the inflammatory diseases combined is estimated at more than 40 million in the United States and up to 700 million worldwide, making macrophage-mediated diseases an area of remarkable clinical importance. There are many recognized disorders having macrophage involvement, including RA, atherosclerosis/vulnerable plaque, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer generally including Kaposi’s sarcoma (“KS”), leishmaniasis, and others that span general clinical areas in cancer immunology, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, cardiology, central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases, and inflammation. For the near term, we have selected target diseases that may, if successfully developed, benefit from this technology.
 
The Company has developed processes for producing the first two therapeutic Manocept immuno-construct series, MT-1000 series, which is designed to specifically target and kill or modify activated CD206+ macrophages by delivering doxorubicin, and MT-2000 series, which is designed to inhibit the inflammatory activity of activated CD206+ macrophages by delivering a potent anti-inflammatory agent, dexamethasone. We have contracted with independent facilities to improve chemical syntheses and to produce sufficient quantities of the MT-1000 series and MT-2000 series agents along with the concomitant analytical standards, to provide material for current and planned preclinical animal studies and future clinical trials.
 
Manocept Platform – Immuno-Diagnostics Clinical Data
 
Rheumatoid Arthritis
 
Two Tc99m tilmanocept dose escalation studies in RA have been completed. The first study was completed and included 18 subjects (nine with active disease and nine healthy subjects) dosed subcutaneously with 50 and 200 µg/2mCi Tc99m tilmanocept (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02683421). The results of this study were presented at five international meetings, including Biotechnology Innovation Organization, Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (“SNMMI”), and The American College of Rheumatology (“ACR”). In addition, based on completion of extensive preclinical dosing studies pursuant to our dialog with the FDA, we have completed a Phase 1/2 study involving intravenous (“IV”) dosing of 39 subjects with IV-administered Tc99m tilmanocept (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02865434). In conjunction with this study, we have completed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics and radiation dosimetry phases in human subjects as well. The majority of the costs of these studies have been supported through a Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grant (NIH/NIAMSD Grant 1 R44 AR067583-01A1). Results of this Phase 1/2 study were presented at the June 2018 and June 2019 SNMMI meetings, the 2018 European League Against Rheumatism (“EULAR”) meeting and the 2018 ACR meeting. These studies have been combined and submitted for peer review publication and full published results will follow.

In June 2019, the results of the Company’s NAV3-21 clinical study were presented at the SNMMI Annual Meeting in Anaheim, California. The presentation, titled “A Phase 1/2 Study of Intravenously Administered Tc99m Tilmanocept to Determine Safety, Tolerability, Optimal Clinical Dose Selection, and Imaging Timepoint in Patients Clinically Diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis,” was delivered by Arash Kardan, M.D. In addition, an abstract of the presentation was published in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2019, Volume 60, Supplement 1). The NAV3-21 study enrolled subjects with active, moderate-to-severe RA, and healthy controls. Results from the completed trial demonstrate that Tc99m tilmanocept is well-tolerated with no serious adverse events, adverse drug reactions, or drug-related adverse events observed. Additionally, static planar images revealed joint-specific Tc99m tilmanocept localization in RA subjects to disease-involved joints of the shoulders, knees, hands, and feet, but no joint-specific localization in healthy control subjects, revealing potentially significant immunodiagnostic information about CD206-expressing synovial macrophage involvement in RA. An optimal imaging time window post-Tc99m tilmanocept IV administration, as well as optimal dosing, were also determined.
 
In April 2019, the Company received feedback from the FDA regarding the Company’s planned clinical studies that will evaluate joint disease in patients with RA and monitor patient response to therapy. The Company’s proposed RA studies were discussed with the FDA during an in-person meeting and through follow-up collaborative efforts. The FDA communicated that the first study, a Phase 2b trial, is aligned with expectations for the studies and that they will continue to work with Navidea as we progress into a second Phase 2b trial correlating Tc99m tilmanocept uptake in RA-involved joints with CD206 immunohistochemistry findings from synovial biopsies and into the planned Phase 3 clinical trial. In May 2019, we began enrolling patients into the first Phase 2b study, entitled “Evaluation of the Precision and Sensitivity of Tilmanocept Uptake Value (“TUV”) on Tc99m Tilmanocept Planar Imaging” (ClinicalTrials.gov MCT03938636). This study will provide confirmatory support necessary to initiate Navidea’s Phase 3 study program.
 
In October 2019, the Company performed its first interim analysis of this trial, covering subjects enrolling into Arms 1 and 2. The results of this interim analysis were in line with the Company’s hypotheses that Tc99m tilmanocept can provide robust, stable imaging in healthy subjects as well as in patients with active RA, and provide the fundamental information needed to keep moving forward into the Phase 3. A summary of these results was presented at the 2020 EULAR meeting. In May 2020, the Company announced the results of its second interim analysis, covering Arm 3 of the trial. This Arm mirrors the upcoming Phase 3 in design and provided information relevant for sample size calculation for the Phase 3 as well as support for the hypothesis that Tc99m tilmanocept imaging can provide an early indicator of treatment efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) alpha therapeutics. These interim results were presented at the 2020 ACR meeting. In June 2020, the Company announced full enrollment into this trial, with imaging events now completed in each patient enrolled in Arm 3. In February 2021, the Company submitted its formal briefing book to the FDA, containing detailed analysis and discussion of the Company’s ongoing Phase 2b study (NAV3-31) and prior studies in RA as well as the design and statistical analysis plan for the proposed Phase 3 for FDA comment. The pivotal Phase 3 study program will assess joint disease status and monitor patient response to therapy.
 
Cardiovascular Disease
 
In collaboration with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, Navidea has completed one and has initiated a second investigator-initiated clinical study evaluating Tc99m tilmanocept’s ability to enable imaging of atherosclerotic plaques. Results of these studies provide strong preliminary evidence of the potential of Tc99m tilmanocept to accumulate specifically in and enable imaging of non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques include plaques with morphologies indicating a high risk of rupture. Rupture of such plaques causes myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and a significant portion of ischemic strokes. The studies compared aortic Tc99m tilmanocept uptake imaged by SPECT/CT in clinically asymptomatic subjects with intermediate Framingham Risk Scores (“FRS”) who were infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (“HIV”) as compared to healthy, uninfected, FRS and age-matched subjects. Tc99m tilmanocept SPECT/CT images were compared to aortic images of the same subjects obtained by contrast enhanced coronary computed tomography angiography and/or [18F]NaF PET/CT.
 
A nine-subject study to evaluate diagnostic imaging of emerging atherosclerosis plaque with the Tc99m tilmanocept product dosed subcutaneously is complete (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02542371). The results of this study were presented at two major international meetings (Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections and SNMMI, 2017) and published in early release in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in January 2017 (published in the circulated version, Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017) 215 (8): 1264-1269), confirming that the Tc99m tilmanocept product can both quantitatively and qualitatively target non-calcified plaque in the aortic arch of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (“AIDS”) patients (supported by NIH/NHLBI Grant 1 R43 HL127846-01).
 
We have also commenced a second Phase 1/2 investigator-initiated study in cooperation with Massachusetts General Hospital in subjects with HIV that expands the original study in both the scope of the drug administration as well as the diagnostic assessment of the subjects. This study will enroll up to 24 AIDS subjects and healthy controls in imaging non-calcified plaque using IV and SC-administered Tc99m tilmanocept and will expand the initial investigation to the assessment of aortic plaque as well as carotid and coronary arteries. Subjects continue to be enrolled in this study and images are currently being evaluated.
 
Navidea has also been awarded a $225,000 phase 1 Small Business Technology Transfer grant (1R41HL147640-01A1) entitled Gallium 68 Tilmanocept for PET Imaging of Atherosclerosis Plaques. This grant will support a research collaboration between Navidea and Dr. Suzanne Lapi of the University of Alabama Birmingham. These efforts will evaluate [68]gallium tilmanocept for imaging plaques in an animal model of atherosclerosis and began activities in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Kaposi’s Sarcoma
 
We initiated and completed a study of KS in 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT022201420) and received additional funding from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) in 2016 to continue diagnostic studies in this disease. The new support not only continues the imaging of the cutaneous form of this disease but expands this to imaging of visceral disease via IV administration of Tc99m tilmanocept (NIH/NCI 1 R44 CA192859-01A1; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03157167). This now-escalated study includes a pathology/biopsy component as well as an imaging component to determine pathology concordance with image assessment. We received Institutional Review Board approval of the clinical protocol and initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study in KS in 2017. This trial has completed enrollment and imaging. Data and image analysis for this study are ongoing.
 
Tuberculosis (“TB”)
 
In April 2019, we announced that Professor Mike Sathekge, MBChB, M. Med (Nuclear Medicine), PhD, Professor and Head of the Department of Nuclear Medicine in the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Pretoria/Steve Biko Academic Hospital, planned to initiate a comparative study evaluating the use of tilmanocept in patients with TB. The purpose of this ongoing study is to explore using 68Ga tilmanocept as an aid in TB patient management while contributing to the better understanding of the biology of TB granulomas. CD206+ macrophages constitute one of the most abundant cell types in TB granulomas. Therefore, a molecular probe such as 68Ga-labeled tilmanocept targeting mannose receptor CD206 expressed on macrophages holds great promise not only in understanding the biology of TB granulomas, but may also support future development of a tilmanocept-like drug delivery vehicle for delivering therapeutic interventions to TB granulomas. Navidea has provided tilmanocept for use in this study, and several subjects have been injected and imaged to date. Successful completion of this study could support an extended claim of 68Ga-tilmanocept.
 
Biomarker Application and Qualification
 
In November 2017, the Company commenced the qualification of the biomarker CD206 with the FDA Biomarker Section of The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”). As per FDA protocol, Navidea submitted a draft letter of intent (“LOI”) to CDER prior to the November 2017 meeting. According to the CDER directive, “the Biomarker Qualification Program was established to support the CDER’s work with external stakeholders to develop biomarkers that aid in the drug development process. Through the FDA’s Biomarker Qualification Program, an entity may request regulatory qualification of a biomarker for a particular context of use (“COU”) in drug development.” Following the meeting with the FDA, and because of Navidea’s data sets and the general external publication database, Navidea, in conjunction with FDA, is now reviewing the LOI with the FDA’s recommended consultants. Navidea has revised the LOI draft strategy in order to expedite the application process. In March 2018, Navidea had a follow-up meeting with the FDA’s assigned strategist, during which the potential to further narrow the LOI elements was reviewed. Navidea is continuing the process of finalizing the COU LOI and providing the background data sets for qualification review with the FDA/CDER. Additional meetings have taken place and the pursuit of this qualification is ongoing.
 
Manocept Platform – In-Vitro and Pre-Clinical Immunotherapeutics Data
 
The Company has been developing Manocept platform drug delivery constructs that carry various payloads including doxorubicin and dexamethasone. Chemical synthesis techniques have advanced considerably, resulting in more robust and reproducible synthesis protocols that provide products with chemical attributes indicative of enhanced in vivo activity. The most advanced drug delivery construct carries a doxorubicin payload and is now in its third generation of chemical synthesis protocol design. This third generation doxorubicin carrying construct has been extensively evaluated in human macrophage cell culture assays and in three experiments using syngeneic mouse cancer models. These experiments show that at treatment doses below what is required to kill macrophages, the doxorubicin carrying constructs dramatically alters the immunological behavior of macrophages, making them more proinflammatory. In one of the syngeneic mouse tumor experiments, the Manocept doxorubicin construct significantly synergized the activity of another anticancer therapy producing anti-tumor activity that was greater than either treatment alone. Near-term experiments with the Manocept doxorubicin construct include further studies in macrophage cell culture, additional syngeneic mouse tumor models, and a toxicity study in rats. Work involving a second generation Manocept dexamethasone carrying construct and efforts developing Manocept constructs with different payloads is ongoing.
 
Kaposi’s Sarcoma
 
The novel MT-1000 class constructs are designed to specifically deliver doxorubicin, a chemotoxin, which can kill KS tumor cells and their tumor-associated macrophages, potentially altering the course of cancer. We have received additional funding to continue therapeutic studies in this disease with the goal of completing an investigational new drug (“IND”) submission for a Manocept construct (MT-1000 class of compounds) consisting of tilmanocept linked to doxorubicin for the treatment of KS. The first part of the grant, now complete, supported analyses including in vitro and cell culture studies, to be followed by Parts 2 and 3 FDA-required preclinical animal testing studies. The information from these studies can be combined with other information in an IND application that can be submitted to the FDA requesting permission to begin testing the compound in selected KS subjects (supported by NIH/NCI 1 R44 CA206788-01).

Other Immunotherapeutic Applications
 
The Company continues to evaluate emerging data in other disease states to define areas of focus, development pathways and partnering options to capitalize on the Manocept platform, including ongoing studies in KS, RA and infectious diseases. The immuno-inflammatory process is remarkably complex and tightly regulated with indicators that initiate, maintain and shut down the process. Macrophages are immune cells that play a critical role in the initiation, maintenance, and resolution of inflammation. They are activated and deactivated in the inflammatory process. Because macrophages may promote dysregulation that accelerates or enhances disease progression, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that target macrophages may open new avenues for controlling inflammatory diseases. There can be no assurance that further evaluation or development will be successful, that any Manocept platform product candidate will ultimately achieve regulatory approval, or if approved, the extent to which it will achieve market acceptance.
Market Overview
 
Manocept Diagnostics and Macrophage Therapeutics Market Overview
 
Impairment of the macrophage-driven disease mechanism is an area of increasing focus in medicine. There are many recognized disorders having macrophage involvement, including RA, atherosclerosis/vulnerable plaque, Crohn’s disease, TB, systemic lupus erythematosus, KS, and others that span clinical areas in oncology, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, cardiology, and inflammation. The number of people affected by all the inflammatory diseases combined is estimated at more than 40 million in the United States, making these macrophage-mediated diseases an area of significant clinical importance. The Arthritis Foundation estimates that RA alone affects over 1.5 million people in the United States and as much as 1% of the worldwide population. Based on the most recent U.S. Medicare/Medicaid data, total annual societal costs of RA are estimated to be over $39 billion.
 
Data from studies using agents from the Manocept platform in RA, KS and TB were published in a special supplement, Nature Outlook: Medical Imaging, in Nature’s October 31, 2013 issue. The supplement included a White Paper by Navidea entitled “Innovations in receptor-targeted precision imaging at Navidea: Diagnosis up close and personal,” focused on the Manocept platform.
 
Tc99m Tilmanocept – Cancer Market Overview
 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society (“ACS”) estimates that cancer will cause over 600,000 deaths in 2021 in the United States alone. Additionally, the ACS estimates that approximately 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States during 2021. The National Cancer Institute estimates that direct medical costs for cancer in the United States for 2015 were $183 billion, and are projected to increase to $246 billion by 2030. Cancer is also the second leading cause of death in Europe. The World Health Organization reports more than 3.7 million new cases and 1.9 million deaths in Europe each year.
 
Tc99m tilmanocept is approved by the FDA for use in solid tumor cancers where lymphatic mapping is a component of surgical management and for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Tc99m tilmanocept has also received European approval in imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma, breast cancer or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. If the potential of Tc99m tilmanocept as a radioactive tracing agent is ultimately realized, it may address not only the breast and melanoma markets on a procedural basis, but also assist in the clinical evaluation and staging of solid tumor cancers and expanding lymph node mapping to other solid tumor cancers such as prostate, gastric, colon, gynecologic, and non-small cell lung.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Following Navidea’s March 2017 sale to Cardinal Health 414, LLC (“Cardinal Health 414”) of all of its assets used in operating its business of developing, manufacturing and commercializing the Company’s radioactive diagnostic agent marketed under the Lymphoseek® trademark in Canada, Mexico and the United States, the Supply and Distribution Agreement between Cardinal Health 414 and Navidea was terminated and Cardinal Health 414 assumed responsibility for marketing Lymphoseek in those territories.

Europe
 
Unlike in the United States, where institutions typically rely on radiopharmaceutical products that are compounded and delivered by specialized radiopharmacy distributors such as Cardinal Health 414, institutions in Europe predominantly purchase non-radiolabeled material and compound the radioactive product on-site. With respect to Tc99m tilmanocept commercialization in Europe, we initially chose a specialty pharmaceutical strategy that we believed would be supportive of premium product positioning and reinforce Tc99m tilmanocept's clinical value proposition, as opposed to a commodity or a generics positioning approach. On March 5, 2015, Navidea entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (as amended to date, the “License Agreement”) for the commercialization and distribution of a 50-microgram kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation (tilmanocept) in the European Union (“EU”) with SpePharm AG (“SpePharm,” an affiliate of Norgine BV), a European specialist pharmaceutical company with an extensive pan-European presence. Under the License Agreement, SpePharm had the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Company’s products approved for radiolabeling with Tc99m and containing Lymphoseek (collectively, the “Products”) in several jurisdictions abroad, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand (collectively, the “Licensed Territory”). In exchange for such rights, the Company was entitled to certain royalty payments. In accordance with the License Agreement, Navidea transferred responsibility for regulatory maintenance of the Tc99m tilmanocept Marketing Authorization to SpePharm. SpePharm was also responsible for production, distribution, pricing, reimbursement, sales, marketing, medical affairs, and regulatory activities.
 
On May 11, 2020 (the “Termination Date”), the Company entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with SpePharm and Norgine BV (“Norgine”) which terminated the March 5, 2015 License Agreement with SpePharm. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the parties agreed that neither owed the other any payments due under the License Agreement as of the Termination Date and that, among other things, SpePharm will no longer have any right in, nor claim to, any intellectual property owned by the Company or its affiliates anywhere in the world. SpePharm also agreed to perform certain wind-down activities (the “Wind-Down Activities”) during the six-month period following the Termination Date (the “Transition Period”), which Transition Period was extended by ninety days. The Wind-Down Activities included, without limitation, SpePharm transferring to the Company or its designee(s) the regulatory approvals controlled by SpePharm or its affiliates for the purpose of marketing, distributing and selling the Products in the Licensed Territory. SpePharm also transferred to the Company certain tenders and other customer and sales contracts related to the Products. Subject to the terms of the Termination Agreement, Norgine, an affiliate of SpePharm, agreed to guarantee SpePharm’s performance of its obligations under the Termination Agreement.
 
On June 9, 2020, Navidea established a new European entity, Navidea Biopharmaceuticals Europe Limited (“Navidea Europe”), to address international development and commercialization needs for our technologies, including Tc99m tilmanocept. SpePharm has transferred the Tc99m tilmanocept Marketing Authorization to Navidea Europe, along with the responsibility for production and commercialization of Tc99m tilmanocept in the Licensed Territory. Navidea Europe is in the process of establishing relationships and executing agreements with third-party providers in order to fulfill such responsibilities. Navidea owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Navidea Europe.
 
China
 
In August 2014, Navidea entered into an exclusive agreement with Beijing Sinotau Medical Research Co., Ltd. (“Sinotau”), a pharmaceutical organization with a broad China focus in oncology and other therapeutic areas, who will develop and commercialize Tc99m tilmanocept in China. In exchange, Navidea will earn revenue based on unit sales to Sinotau, royalties based on Sinotau’s sales of Tc99m tilmanocept and milestone payments from Sinotau, including a $300,000 non-refundable upfront payment. As part of the agreement, Sinotau is responsible for costs and conduct of clinical studies and regulatory applications to obtain Tc99m tilmanocept approval by the China Food and Drug Administration (“CFDA”). Upon approval, Sinotau will be responsible for all Tc99m tilmanocept sales, marketing, market access and medical affairs activities in China and excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Navidea and Sinotau will jointly support certain pre-market planning activities with a joint commitment on clinical and market development programs pending CFDA approval.
India
 
In June 2017, Navidea entered into an exclusive license and distribution agreement with Sayre Therapeutics (“Sayre”) for the development and commercialization of Tc99m tilmanocept in India. Sayre specializes in innovative treatments and medical devices commercialization in South Asia. Under the terms of the agreement, Navidea received a $100,000 upfront payment and is eligible to receive milestone payments and double-digit royalties associated with the sale of Tc99m tilmanocept in India. Tc99m tilmanocept has not yet received marketing approval in India.
Summary
 
Tc99m tilmanocept is in various stages of approval in other global markets and sales to this point in these markets, to the extent there were any, have not been material. However, we believe that with international partnerships to complement our positions in the EU, China and India, we will help establish Tc99m tilmanocept as a global leader in lymphatic mapping, as we are not aware of any other company that has a global geographic range. However, it is possible that Tc99m tilmanocept will never achieve regulatory approval in any market outside the United States or EU, or if approved, that it may not achieve market acceptance in any market. We may also experience difficulty in securing collaborative partners for other global markets or radiopharmaceutical products, or successfully negotiating acceptable terms for such arrangements. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”

Manufacturing
 
We currently use and expect to continue to be dependent upon contract manufacturers to manufacture each of our product candidates. We maintain a quality control and quality assurance program, including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications, with the goal that our products and product candidates are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) and other applicable domestic and international regulations. We may need to invest in additional manufacturing and supply chain resources, and may seek to enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other parties that have established manufacturing capabilities. It is likely that we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for our development and commercial products on a contract basis. We may not be successful in completing agreements for the supply of Tc99m tilmanocept on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
Competition
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We face competition from a variety of companies focused on developing inflammatory, oncology and CV disease diagnostic imaging agents and other diagnostic modalities. We compete with large pharmaceutical and other specialized biotechnology companies. We also face competition from universities and other non-profit research organizations. Many emerging medical product companies have corporate partnership arrangements with large, established companies to support the research, development, and commercialization of products that may be competitive with our products. In addition, a number of large established companies are developing proprietary technologies or have enhanced their capabilities by entering into arrangements with or acquiring companies with technologies applicable to the detection or treatment of cancer and other diseases targeted by our product candidates. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of these competitors have products that have been approved or are in development and operate large, well-funded research and development programs. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, regulatory, marketing, and production resources than we have. Other companies may develop and introduce products and processes competitive with or superior to ours.
 
We expect to encounter significant competition for our pharmaceutical products. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage if their products work through a similar mechanism as our products and if the approved indications are similar. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us. In some instances, such products have already entered late-stage clinical trials or received FDA approval and may be marketed for some period prior to the approval of our products.
 
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced “best-in-class” technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain scientific personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products, either alone or through third parties. We expect that competition among products cleared for marketing will be based on, among other things, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, and patent position. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
 
Tc99m Tilmanocept Competition – Currently Approved Indications
 
Some surgeons who practice the lymphatic mapping procedure for which Tc99m tilmanocept is intended currently use other radiopharmaceuticals such as a sulfur colloid or other colloidal compounds. In addition, some surgeons still use vital blue dyes to assist in the visual identification of the draining lymphatic tissue around a primary tumor. In the EU and certain Pacific Rim markets, there are colloidal-based compounds with various levels of approved labeling for use in lymphatic mapping, although a number of countries still employ products used “off-label.”
Rheumatoid Arthritis Competition
 
Currently, no single test is available to diagnose and monitor RA. Rather, a rheumatologist will make a diagnosis based on several procedures that may include a physical exam, blood tests, and/or imaging tests, among others. The Arthritis Foundation states that the goals of RA treatment are to relieve symptoms, stop inflammation, prevent joint and organ damage, improve physical function and well-being, and reduce long-term complications. Medications for the treatment of RA currently fall into two categories: drugs that ease symptoms, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and drugs that slow disease activity. Drugs that slow disease activity include corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologics, and Janus kinase inhibitors. Many of these drugs are produced and sold by large pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie, Amgen, Bristol Meyers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, and Roche, among others.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
The patent position of biotechnology companies, including Navidea, generally is highly uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. Potential competitors may have filed applications, or may have been issued patents, or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes in the same area of technology as that used by the Company. The scope and validity of these patents and applications, the extent to which we may be required to obtain licenses thereunder or under other proprietary rights, and the cost and availability of licenses are uncertain. Our patent applications or those licensed to us may not result in additional patents being issued, and our patents or those licensed to us may not afford protection against competitors with similar technology; these patents may be designed around by others or others may obtain patents that we would need to license or design around.
 
We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or disclose such technology, or we may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets.
 
We require our employees, consultants, advisers, and suppliers to execute a confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of an employment, consulting or manufacturing relationship with us. The agreement provides that all confidential information developed by or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be the exclusive property of our company. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. We also employ a variety of security measures to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to limit access by unauthorized persons. However, these measures may not be adequate to protect our trade secrets from unauthorized access or disclosure. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
 
Tilmanocept Intellectual Property
 
Tilmanocept is under license from the University of California, San Diego (“UCSD”) to Navidea for the exclusive world-wide rights in all diagnostic and therapeutic uses of tilmanocept, except for the use of Tc99m tilmanocept in lymphatic mapping in Canada, Mexico and the United States, which rights have been licensed directly to Cardinal Health 414 by UCSD. Navidea maintains license rights to Tc99m tilmanocept in the rest of the world, as well as a license to the intellectual property underlying the Manocept platform.
 
Tc99m tilmanocept and related compositions, including the Manocept backbone composition and methods of use, are the subject of multiple patent families including issued patents and patent applications in the United States and certain major foreign markets.
 
The first composition of matter patent covering tilmanocept was issued to UCSD in the United States in June 2002 and would have expired in May 2020. However, Navidea was granted a five-year patent term extension under the Hatch Waxman Act due to time lost in regulatory review. The claims of the composition of matter patent covering tilmanocept have been allowed in the EU and issued in the majority of major-market EU countries in 2004. These patents would have expired in 2020, but requests for supplemental protection certificates are in process to further extend the life of these patents, and some have been granted, extending the patent term to 2025. The composition of matter patent issued in Japan expired in 2020.
 
Patent applications have been filed by Navidea in the U.S. and certain major foreign markets related to manufacturing processes for tilmanocept, the first of which was issued in the U.S. in 2013. These patents and/or applications will expire between 2029 and 2034. Further patent applications have been filed by Navidea alone or with The Ohio State Innovation Foundation related to CD206 expressing cell-related disorders and diseases. These patents and/or applications are expected to expire between 2034 and 2040.
 
Government Regulation
 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Service Act, and their implementing regulations. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications or supplemental applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. We also may be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Atomic Energy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Export Control Act and other present and future laws of general application as well as those specifically related to radiopharmaceuticals.
 
Most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which we conduct our operations. As a developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical products, we are subject to extensive regulation by, among other governmental entities, the FDA and the corresponding state, local and foreign regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which our products are intended to be sold. These regulations govern the introduction of new products, the observance of certain standards with respect to the manufacture, quality, safety, efficacy and labeling of such products, the maintenance of certain records, the tracking of such products, performance surveillance and other matters.
 
   8

  

Failure to comply with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations could subject us to enforcement action, including product seizures, recalls, withdrawal of marketing clearances, and civil and criminal penalties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such governmental regulations. However, federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of radiopharmaceuticals are subject to future changes. Such changes may have a material adverse effect on our company.
 
For some products, and in some countries, government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a trend toward more stringent regulation. In recent years, the FDA and certain foreign regulatory bodies have pursued a more rigorous enforcement program to ensure that regulated businesses like ours comply with applicable laws and regulations. We devote significant time, effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to our business. To date, we have not received a noncompliance notification or warning letter from the FDA or any other regulatory bodies of alleged deficiencies in our compliance with the relevant requirements, nor have we recalled or issued safety alerts on any of our products. However, a warning letter, recall or safety alert, if it occurred, could have a material adverse effect on our company. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
 
The FDA review processes could delay our Company's introduction of new products in the United States in the future. In addition, many foreign countries have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements that also have added to the delays and uncertainties associated with the development and release of new products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting such releases. It is possible that delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, any necessary clearance for our new product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors.”
 
The U.S. Drug Approval Process
 
None of our drugs may be marketed in the United States until such drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:

● | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of the manufacturing and clinical facilities at which the drug is produced, tested, and/or distributed to assess compliance with cGMPs and current good clinical practices (“cGCP”) standards; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board at each institution where the trials will be conducted. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational product into people to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited subject population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and further test its safety by using the product candidate in its final form in an expanded subject population. There can be no assurance that Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
   9

  

The FDA and the IND sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA application. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”). These agreements may not be changed after the clinical studies begin, except in limited circumstances. The existence of a SPA, however, does not assure approval of a product candidate.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacturing quality and composition of the investigational product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial review user fee to the FDA. Before approving a NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities where the product is manufactured, tested and distributed and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy, or impose other post-approval commitment conditions.
 
The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process of reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those for serious or life threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. Our drug candidates may not qualify for any of these programs, or, if a drug candidate does qualify, the review time may not be reduced or the product may not be approved.
 
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted.
 
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements

Holders of an approved NDA are required to: (i) conduct pharmacovigilance and report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing and distribution facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality control and distribution to maintain cGMP compliance. We use and will continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
 
Marketing of prescription drugs is also subject to significant regulation through federal and state agencies tasked with consumer protection and prevention of medical fraud, waste and abuse. We must comply with restrictions on off-label use promotion, anti-kickback, ongoing clinical trial registration, and limitations on gifts and payments to physicians.
 
Non-U.S. Regulation
 
Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States, although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including additional clinical trials that may be required, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
 
In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states. A mutual recognition procedure is available at the request of the applicant for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.
 
The European Commission granted marketing authorization for Tc99m tilmanocept in the EU in November 2014, and a reduced-mass vial developed for the EU market was approved in September 2016.
 
While we are unable to predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future regulatory developments, we believe that our substantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions on our operations throughout the world, and our development of new and improved products, should enable us to compete effectively within this environment.

Regulation Specific to Radiopharmaceuticals
 
Our radiolabeled targeting agents and biologic products, if developed, would require a regulatory license to market from the FDA and from comparable agencies in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory licenses and approvals is costly and time consuming, and we have encountered significant impediments and delays related to our previously proposed biologic products.
 
The process of completing pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing validation and submission of a marketing application to the appropriate regulatory bodies usually takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources, and any approval may not granted on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, the length of time it takes for the various regulatory bodies to evaluate an application for marketing approval varies considerably, as does the amount of preclinical and clinical data required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a specific product. The regulatory bodies may require additional clinical studies that may take several years to perform. The length of the review period may vary widely depending upon the nature and indications of the proposed product and whether the regulatory body has any further questions or requests any additional data. Also, the regulatory bodies require post-marketing reporting and surveillance programs (pharmacovigilance) to monitor the side effects of the products. Our potential drug or biologic products may not be approved by the regulatory bodies or may not be approved on a timely or accelerated basis, or any approvals received may subsequently be revoked or modified.
 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) oversees medical uses of nuclear material through licensing, inspection, and enforcement programs. The NRC issues medical use licenses to medical facilities and authorized physician users, develops guidance and regulations for use by licensees, and maintains a committee of medical experts to obtain advice about the use of byproduct materials in medicine. The NRC (or the responsible Agreement State) also regulates the manufacture and distribution of these products. The FDA oversees the good practices in the manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals, medical devices, and radiation-producing x-ray machines and accelerators. The states regulate the practices of medicine and pharmacy and administer programs associated with radiation-producing x-ray machines and accelerators. We may not be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits and we may not be able to comply with all applicable laws. The failure to obtain such licenses and permits or to comply with applicable laws would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Goldberg Litigation
 
In August 2018, Dr. Michael Goldberg resigned from his positions as an executive officer and a director of Navidea.  In connection with Dr. Goldberg’s resignation, Navidea and Dr. Goldberg entered into an Agreement (the “Goldberg Agreement”), with the intent of entering into one or more additional Definitive Agreements, which set forth the terms of the separation from service.  Among other things, the Goldberg Agreement provided that Dr. Goldberg would be entitled to 1,175,000 shares of our Common Stock, representing in part payment of accrued bonuses and payment of the balance of the Platinum debt.  A portion of the 1,175,000 shares to be issued to Dr. Goldberg would be held in escrow for up to 18 months in order to reimburse Navidea in the event that Navidea is obligated to pay any portion of the Platinum debt to a party other than Dr. Goldberg.  Further, the Goldberg Agreement provided that the Company’s subsidiary, MT, would redeem all of Dr. Goldberg’s preferred stock and issue to Dr. Goldberg super voting common stock equal to 5% of the outstanding shares of MT.  In November 2018, the Company issued 925,000 shares of our Common Stock to Dr. Goldberg, 250,000 of which were placed in escrow in accordance with the Goldberg Agreement.
 
On February 11, 2019, Dr. Goldberg represented to the MT Board that he had, without MT Board or shareholder approval, created a subsidiary of MT, transferred all of the assets of MT into the subsidiary, and then issued himself stock in the subsidiary.  On February 19, 2019, Navidea notified MT that it was terminating the sublicense in accordance with its terms, effective March 1, 2019, due to MT’s insolvency.  On February 20, 2019, the MT Board removed Dr. Goldberg as President and Chief Executive Officer of MT and from any other office of MT to which he may have been appointed or in which he was serving. Dr. Goldberg remains a member of the MT Board, together with Michael Rice and Dr. Claudine Bruck.  Mr. Rice and Dr. Bruck remain members of the board of directors of Navidea.  The MT Board then appointed Jed A. Latkin to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of MT. On or about December 18, 2020, the Joint Official Liquidators and Foreign Representatives of Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage Fund L.P. sent a letter to MT directing that Dr. Goldberg be removed from the MT Board.  The MT Board has taken no action in response.
 
New York Litigation Involving Dr. Goldberg
 
On February 20, 2019, Navidea filed a complaint against Dr. Goldberg in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York (the “District Court”), alleging breach of the Goldberg Agreement, as well as a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and to obtain a declaratory judgment that Navidea’s performance under the Goldberg Agreement is excused and that Navidea is entitled to terminate the Goldberg Agreement as a result of Dr. Goldberg’s actions. On April 26, 2019, Navidea filed an amended complaint against Dr. Goldberg which added a claim for breach of fiduciary duty seeking damages related to certain actions Dr. Goldberg took while CEO of Navidea. On June 13, 2019, Dr. Goldberg answered the amended complaint and asserted counterclaims against Navidea and third-party claims against MT for breach of the Goldberg Agreement, wrongful termination, injunctive relief, and quantum meruit.
 
   11

  

On December 26, 2019, the District Court ruled on several motions related to Navidea and MT and Dr. Goldberg that substantially limited the claims that Dr. Goldberg can pursue against Navidea and MT.  Specifically, the District Court found that certain portions of Dr. Goldberg’s counterclaims against Navidea and third-party claims against MT failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Additionally, the District Court ruled that actions taken by Navidea and MT, including reconstituting the MT board of directors, replacing Dr. Goldberg with Mr. Latkin as Chief Executive Officer of MT, terminating the sublicense between Navidea and MT, terminating certain research projects, and allowing MT intellectual property to revert back to Navidea, were not breaches of the Goldberg Agreement.
 
The District Court also rejected Dr. Goldberg’s claim for wrongful termination as Chief Executive Officer of MT. In addition, the District Court found that Dr. Goldberg lacked standing to seek injunctive relief to force the removal of Dr. Claudine Bruck and Michael Rice from MT’s Board of Directors, to invalidate all actions taken by the MT Board on or after November 29, 2018 (the date upon which Dr. Bruck and Mr. Rice were appointed by Navidea to the Board of MT), or to reinstate the terminated sublicense between Navidea and MT.
 
In addition, the District Court found Navidea’s breach of fiduciary duty claim against Dr. Goldberg for conduct occurring more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint to be time-barred and that Dr. Goldberg is entitled to an advancement of attorneys’ fees solely with respect to that claim.  The parties have briefed the issue to the District Court for resolution on how much in fees Dr. Goldberg is owed under the District Court’s order.
 
On January 31, 2020, Goldberg filed a motion for leave to amend his complaint to add back in claims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit and injunctive relief.  On April 1, 2020, the District Court denied Dr. Goldberg’s motion for leave to amend in its entirety.
 
On January 27, 2020, Dr. Goldberg filed a motion seeking additional advancement from Navidea for fees in connection with the New York Action and the Delaware Action.  Navidea opposed the motion and the District Court referred the matters to a Magistrate Judge.  On July 9, 2020, the Magistrate Judge issued her Report and Recommendation which recommended that:  (1) the District Court decline to exercise jurisdiction over Dr. Goldberg’s motion as it pertained to expenses and fees incurred in defense of the Delaware Action; (2) the District Court decline to award any fees to Dr. Goldberg for the breach of fiduciary duty without additional motion practice on the issue; (3) the District Court find that Dr. Goldberg is entitled to advancement of his expenses and fees reasonably incurred in the defense of the remainder of the New York action subject to Dr. Goldberg’s posting of an undertaking; and (4) establish a protocol by which  Dr. Goldberg could establish the amounts due for advancement. 
 
On August 24, 2020, in connection with Dr. Goldberg’s motion for advancement, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation and found that while Dr. Goldberg was not being granted advancement of fees and expenses incurred in connection with either the Delaware Action or the assertion of third-party claims against MT, the Court ruled that Dr. Goldberg was entitled to advancement for the defense of the remaining claims asserted against him by Navidea in the New York action.  The Court adopted a protocol by which additional motion practice will occur to determine the appropriate amount of fees to be advanced.  Once that decision is made by the Magistrate Judge, subject to review by the District Court, Navidea will need to advance those fees to Dr. Goldberg conditioned upon Dr. Goldberg agreeing to pay those fees back to Navidea if it is determined that he is not entitled to indemnification.  Dr. Goldberg is also asking the Court to accelerate the timeline by which advancement will occur, is asking the Court to expand the scope of issues to which Dr. Goldberg would be entitled to advancement, and is seeking to hold Navidea in contempt for failing to advance fees to date.  The Company has opposed Dr. Goldberg’s requests.
 
Fact discovery in the New York Action has been completed and the parties and the Court anticipate meeting in the future to address remaining case deadlines.
 
Delaware Litigation Involving Dr. Goldberg
 
On February 20, 2019, MT initiated a suit against Dr. Goldberg in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Court”), alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty as a director and officer of MT and conversion, and to obtain a declaratory judgment that the transactions Dr. Goldberg caused MT to effect are void.  On June 12, 2019, the Delaware Court found that Dr. Goldberg’s actions were not authorized in compliance with the Delaware General Corporate Law.  Specifically, the Delaware Court found that Dr. Goldberg’s creation of a new subsidiary of MT and the purported assignment by Dr. Goldberg of MT’s intellectual property to that subsidiary were void.  The Delaware Court’s ruling follows the order on May 23, 2019 in the case, in which it found Dr. Goldberg in contempt of its prior order holding Dr. Goldberg responsible for the payment of MT’s fees and costs to cure the damages caused by Dr. Goldberg’s contempt.  MT’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion against Dr. Goldberg remain pending.  As a result of the Delaware Court’s ruling and Navidea’s prior termination of the sublicense between itself and MT, all of the intellectual property related to the Manocept platform is now directly controlled by Navidea.  A trial on MT’s claims against Goldberg for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion was held on December 1 through December 3, 2020.  The Delaware Court requested post-trial briefing and a post-trial hearing.  In addition, Dr. Goldberg filed two additional requests for relief – one seeking to hold MT’s directors in contempt and one seeking to challenge the appointment of certain individuals to the MT board of directors. MT opposed Dr. Goldberg’s filings.  The Delaware Court conducted oral argument on all remaining issues on March 16, 2021 and indicated that a written opinion will be forthcoming.

Derivative Action Involving Dr. Goldberg
 
On July 26, 2019, Dr. Goldberg served shareholder demands on the Boards of Directors of Navidea and MT repeating many of the claims made in the lawsuits described above. On or about November 20, 2019, Dr. Goldberg commenced a derivative action purportedly on behalf of MT in the District Court against Dr. Claudine Bruck, Y. Michael Rice, and Jed Latkin alleging a claim for breach of fiduciary duty based on the actions alleged in the demands.  On April 3, 2020, Dr. Goldberg dismissed the derivative action in New York without prejudice, and the Court approved the dismissal.  Dr. Goldberg retains the ability to re-file the action in Delaware.  Dr. Goldberg has not yet re-filed his derivative complaint.
