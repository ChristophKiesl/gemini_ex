ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Overview
 
Co-Diagnostics, Inc., a Utah corporation (the “Company” or “CDI”), is developing robust and innovative molecular tools for detection of infectious diseases, liquid biopsy for cancer screening, and agricultural applications. We develop, manufacture and sell reagents used for diagnostic tests that function via the detection and/or analysis of nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA). In connection with the sale of our tests we may sell diagnostic equipment from other manufacturers as self-contained lab systems (which we refer to as the “MDx Device”).
 
Our diagnostics systems enable very rapid, low-cost, molecular testing for organisms and genetic diseases by automating historically complex procedures in both the development and administration of tests. CDI’s technical advance involves a novel approach to Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) test design of primer and probe structure (“CoPrimers”) that eliminates one of the key vexing issues of PCR amplification, the exponential growth of primer-dimer pairs (false positives and false negatives) which adversely interferes with identification of the target DNA/RNA.
 
We believe our proprietary molecular diagnostics technology is paving the way for innovation in disease detection and life sciences research through our enhanced detection of genetic material. Because we own our platform, we believe we will be able to accomplish this faster and more economically, allowing for significant margins while still positioning the Company to be a low-cost provider of molecular diagnostics and screening services.
 
In addition, continued development has demonstrated the unique properties of our CoPrimer technology that make it ideally suited for a variety of applications where specificity is key to optimal results, including multiplexing several targets, enhanced Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (“SNP”) detection and enrichment for next gen sequencing.
 
Our scientists use the complex mathematics of DNA/RNA test design, to engineer and optimize a DNA/RNA test and to automate algorithms that rapidly screen millions of possible options to pinpoint the optimum design. Dr. Satterfield, our founder, developed the Company’s intellectual property consisting of the predictive mathematical algorithms and proprietary reagents used in the testing process, which together represent a major advance in PCR testing systems. CDI technologies are now protected by eight granted or pending US and foreign patents, as well as certain trade secrets and copyrights. Ownership of our proprietary platform permits us the advantage of avoiding payment of patent royalties required by other PCR test systems, which enables the sale of diagnostic tests at a lower price than competitors, while enabling us to maintain profit margins.
 
We may either sell or lease the MDx Device to labs and diagnostic centers, through sale or lease agreements, and sell the reagents that comprise our proprietary tests to those laboratories and testing facilities.
 
We design our tests by identifying the optimal locations on the target gene for amplification and pair the location with the optimized primer and probe structure to achieve outputs that meet the design input requirements identified from market research. This is done by following planned and documented processes, procedures and testing. In other words, the data resulting from our tests verify that we succeeded in designing what we intended at the outset. Verification is a series of testing that concludes that the product is ready to proceed to validation in an evaluation either in our lab or in an independent laboratory setting using initial production tests to confirm that the product as designed meets the user needs.
 
Using our proprietary test design system and proprietary reagents, we have designed and obtained regulatory approval in the European Community and in India to sell PCR diagnostic tests for COVID-19, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, human papilloma virus, malaria, chikungunya, dengue, and the zika virus. In the United States, CDI has obtained Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) for its COVID-19 test from the FDA and sells that test to qualified labs. In addition, our LogixSmart COVID-19 test has been approved for sale in Australia and Mexico by the regulatory bodies in those countries and has been registered for sale in many more countries.

In addition to testing for infectious disease, the technology lends itself to identifying any section of a DNA or RNA strand that describe any type of genetic trait, which creates a number of significant applications. We, in conjunction with our customers, are active in designing and licensing tests that identify genetic traits in plant and animal genomes. We also have three multiplexed tests developed to test mosquitos for the identification of diseases carried by the mosquitos to enable municipalities to concentrate their efforts in spraying mosquito populations on the specific areas known to be breeding the mosquitos that carry deadly viruses.
 
On January 23, 2020, we announced the completion of the principal design work for a PCR screening test for the new coronavirus, COVID-19, intended to address the potential need for detection of the virus. An outbreak of respiratory illness caused by the pneumonia-like COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world since first being discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 31, 2019. China confirmed human-to-human transmission of the virus and the United States announced the first infection in this country, detected in a traveler returning from Wuhan. Our COVID-19 test features the Company’s patented CoPrimer™ technology, and was designed using our proprietary software system, following the guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
 
On February 20, 2020, we announced that our Logix Smart™ COVID-19 Test technical file had been submitted for registration with the European Union, and that it was expected to be available late February as an in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) for markets that accept a CE marking as valid regulatory approval. Subsequently, on February 24, 2020, we announced that our test obtained regulatory clearance to be sold as an IVD for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in markets that accept CE-marking as valid regulatory approval, and became available for purchase from the Company’s Utah-based ISO-13485:2016 certified facility. The Declaration of Conformity for the Logix Smart COVID-19 test confirms that it meets the Essential Requirements of the European Community’s In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (IVDD 98/79/EC), permitting export and sales of the product as an IVD in the European Community. We shipped samples of the Research Use Only version of our test to distributors in various countries, which allowed future customers to confirm the quality and sensitivity of the product, and for us to accelerate the sales efforts of the COVID-19 test.
 
We commenced sales of the COVID-19 tests in February and March of 2020 to international customers and have since sold approximately 10,000,000 tests in numerous countries around the world through an expanding distributor network.
 
On April 6, 2020, we announced that we had received an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA allowing us to commence sales of our Logix Smart COVID-19 test to laboratories certified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Clinical Laboratories Improvements Act (“CLIA”) to accept human samples for diagnostics testing throughout the United States and have sold our Logix Smart COVID-19 test to such CLIA labs since that time.
 
Recent Developments
 
Because we believe that testing for the COVID-19 virus is going to be a consideration for public health worldwide even after the current pandemic has subsided, we have initiated a project to facilitate frequent testing in schools, businesses, and the hospitality industry. We believe this may be accomplished through the development of a low cost, easy to use by non-professionals, testing device that can provide PCR quality test results in less than an hour. This project is possible due to the facts that in 2020 we were able to successfully lyophilize our Logix Smart Covid-19 test reagents and additionally developed a saliva-based collection system that does not require the RNA/DNA extraction. While the final result is the same as if done through a lab-based IVD process, it has the advantages of increased speed and ease of handling thanks to lyophilization. We have engaged the services of a group of professionals who have the expertise to develop the hardware for such a device using our CoPrimers as the reagent chemistry. The device will be available to homes, offices, event facilities, and the travel industry at a cost that will allow screening frequently to prevent spread of the COVID-19 virus in the future. The device would also be available to test for other pathogens detectable through saliva samples as we develop those tests and offer them to the marketplace.

Infectious Disease Product Offering
 
Using our proprietary test design system and proprietary reagents, we design and sell PCR diagnostic tests for diseases and pathogens such as COVID-19, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, malaria, dengue, human papilloma virus, chikungunya, and Zika virus, all of which tests have been designed and verified in our laboratory. Our tuberculosis test and Zika test received a CE Mark in 2018, and a triplex test for Zika, dengue and chikungunya received a CE Mark in 2019, qualifying the tests to be sold throughout the European community and in most countries in central and South America. In December, 2019, our Indian joint venture received a license to manufacture and sell tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papilloma virus 16/18 and malaria tests in India from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (“CDSCO”). In February 2020, we received a CE Mark for our Logix Smart COVID-19 test and in April 2020, our COVID-19 test was approved for manufacture and sale in India by the CDSCO and in Mexico by the INDRE, Mexico’s equivalent to the United States Center for Disease Control. In August 2020, we received approval from the Australian Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Division to sell our COVID-19 test in Australia.
 
As explained above, the development of our Logix Smart COVID-19 test was designed, developed, submitted for regulatory approval and ready to be used both as a Research Use Only (“RUO”) and as an IVD in countries that accept a CE Mark as approval for use of the test in a period of just over thirty days. This is a real-world example of how in an evolving epidemic that the CDI technology can be used to get diagnostics tools in the hands of medical professionals without delay. It can be similarly used to design a test for mutations of the virus should they occur and not be detectable using currently available tests.
 
Caribbean and Central and South America
 
Our initial sales were to entities located in South and Central America. In some of those countries, there are limited regulatory hurdles so we started offering our tests immediately. We have applied for registration of our tests in those countries that require registration and our distributors in those countries have provided us with in country assistance in completing such registrations.
 
We first offered our Zika test in this region because of the demand for such test, followed quickly by tests for tuberculosis, our triplex test for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue, hepatitis B and C, and dengue. Sales of those tests have not been material, but with the granting of a CE mark for our Logix Smart COVID-19, we began significant sales in this region. Products are manufactured for sale upon receipt of purchase orders from distributors, labs and hospitals.
 
India
 
In January 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to manufacture diagnostics tests for seven infectious diseases with a pharmaceutical manufacturing company in India and formed an Indian joint venture organized as CoSara Diagnostics, Pvt (“CoSara”). The agreement provided for the construction of a manufacturing plant and the manufacture of the tests named above and the joint sales and marketing of those tests in India. We have received a license for the plant in Ranoli, India to manufacture approved tests and has been used for testing and manufacturing for the Indian market.
 
As mentioned above, the CDSCO has given us the approval for manufacture and sale of the nine tests referred above and the Company has begun manufacture and sale of those tests. The Company has commenced a reagent rental program in India with thermocyclers purchased from third-party vendors and which we refer to as our MDx Device. Each of the reagent rental placements requires the purchase of a minimum number of tests per month. The placement of thermocyclers in India has facilitated the sale of the SaraGene COVID-19 tests in India, which has made CoSara profitable in 2020. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) 2019 Global Tuberculosis Report indicates that India is the country with the highest number of cases of tuberculosis in the world. WHO tuberculosis statistics for India for 2018 give an estimated incidence figure of 2.69 million cases of tuberculosis for India out of a global incidence of approximately 10.0 million. The tuberculosis incidence for India is the number of new cases of active tuberculosis disease in India during a certain time period (usually a year). We believe that we will be able to sell our tuberculosis test in India through our sales distribution network that we are building currently.
 
On March 19, 2020, we announced that CoSara received authorization to begin manufacture and sale of COVID-19 tests in India. Those tests in India are branded as SaraGene COVID-19 tests and are sold exclusively by CoSara. Because any commercial activity in India was severely restricted until May 2020, CoSara was not able to commence the manufacturing and sale of the SaraGene COVID-19 tests until late in the second quarter, but sales efforts have resulted in CoSara being profitable since the commencement of sales of the COVID-19 tests. The Indian government places restrictions on the price that could be charged for COVID-19 tests which has limited the sales in India more than we have experienced in other parts of the world.

Europe
 
Molecular diagnostics, such as our tests, are governed in Europe by the framework for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), which encompasses diagnostic products such as reagents, instruments and systems intended for use in diagnosis of disease. The regulatory system for IVDs is built largely on a self-certification procedure, placing heavy responsibility on manufacturers. Non self-certified products are subject to the same standards as self-certified products but are subject to audit and review by a notified body prior to receiving approval to be CE-marked. A CE-marking is a manufacturer’s declaration that a product meets the requirements of the applicable European Commission directive. Examples of current obligations include having in place a qualitative manufacturing process, user instructions that are clear and fit for purpose, ensuring that the ‘physical’ features of devices and diagnostics do not pose any danger. If a product fulfils these and other related control requirements, it may be CE-marked as an indication that the product is compliant with EU legislation and sold in the European Union. We have received CE Marks for six of our tests including COVID-19, COVID-19 (2 gene test), ABC (a triplex test for Flu A, Flu B and COVID-19), tuberculosis, Zika, and our Zika, dengue, chikungunya triplex tests.
 
We have received ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 certifications relating to the design and manufacture of our medical device products. The ISO certification indicates that we meet the standards required to self-certify certain of our products and affix a CE-marking for sales of our products in countries accepting the CE marking (not in the United States) with only minimal further governmental approvals and registrations in most countries.
 
United States
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted permission for us to export all of our IVD products. The FDA’s permission to export was granted under Section 801(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDC Act”). Section 801(e) of the FDA Act covers certain medical devices that have not yet received an approved Premarket Approval in the United States by the FDA, such as our products. We have not commenced any Premarket Approval steps with the FDA. Section 801(e) of the FDA Act applies to medical devices that are acceptable to the importing country and that are manufactured under the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices. We have received EUA for our COVID-19 test, which allows sales to qualified labs in the United States.
 
Under our EUA, we are actively selling our LogixSmart COVID-19 test to CLIA certified laboratories in the United States and the CLIA labs are able to use our test as it is or further qualify our LogixSmart test as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT), a diagnostic test that has been validated for use in the CLIA lab. These tests may be used by the lab only in that laboratory. CLIA laboratories develop the performance characteristics, perform the analytical validation for their LDT’s and obtain licenses to offer them as diagnostic services. The FDA has publicly announced its intention to regulate certain LDTs in a phased-in approach, but draft guidance that was published a couple of years ago was withdrawn at the end of the Obama administration and replaced by an informal non-enforceable discussion paper reflecting some of the feedback that it received on LDT regulation. We are currently marketing our Logix Smart COVID-19 test to CLIA laboratories throughout the US.
 
Market Opportunity
 
The market opportunity for our tests changed radically with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because we were able to respond rapidly and produce a quality product, we have been able to build a distribution network that extends to more than 80 countries with over 50 active distributors, most of which have been the sales network that has allowed us to export products throughout the world. Approximately 40% of our sales in 2020 came through sales by our distribution network. We believe that after the pandemic is brought under control, the network of distributors that we have built in these extra-ordinary times will serve us well in sales of other diagnostic tests.
 
The molecular diagnostics market is a fast-growing portion of the in vitro (test tube-based, controlled environment) diagnostics market. There are several advantages of molecular tests, such as the ones we market and sell, over other forms of diagnostic testing. These advantages include higher specificity and sensitivity, the ability to perform multiplex tests and the ability to test for drug resistance or for individual genes.

Mosquito Vector Control Services
 
In response to market demand, we introduced our first diagnostics tests to be used exclusively to test for mosquito borne pathogens in June 2019. Municipalities in the US and many other countries in the world are concerned about the diseases carried by mosquitos and which infect the human population. To prevent outbreaks of potentially harmful viruses, such as Zika or West Nile, from infecting the public the municipalities conduct spraying operations to eliminate the mosquito populations carrying the diseases. Because it is too expensive and potentially harmful to the environment to spray all mosquito breeding areas, the solution is to identify which particular area has mosquitos that are carrying the harmful viruses. To know where the host mosquitos with the harmful viruses are located, traps are set, mosquitos collected and then tested to find the areas that most needed spraying. There are over 3,000 mosquito abatement districts throughout the United States and almost all of them conduct testing to help make the spraying more effective.
 
Our first vector related test was a triplex test that tests for West Nile, western equine and St. Louis encephalitis. We began shipping the tests in June 2019. We added a second test that tests mosquitos for Zika, chikungunya and dengue in a triplex test. Finally, in November 2019, we completed a test for West Nile, eastern equine and St. Louis encephalitis, specifically for use in the eastern United States. As a result, mosquito abatement districts can test for three target viruses in one test as compared to performing three different tests using other market available tests, which saves our customers money. Additionally, the districts are more effective because they can get test results in a matter of hours using our product instead of weeks when they have to wait for a central lab to process the mosquito tests.
 
We have sold our Vector Smart test products and/or related lab equipment to testing districts in different sections of the country and are marketing our products through trade shows, electronic and regular mail solicitations and have hired additional sales personnel in the eastern US to more economically and efficiently market to the east coast areas.
 
Competitive Advantages of Co-Diagnostics
 
We believe that we have the following competitive advantages:
 

● | Affordability: Lower-cost test kits and low-cost MDx-device. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Flexibility: CDI’s tests have been designed to run on many vendors’ DNA/RNA diagnostic testing machines. These tests are particularly well suited to the new generation of “lab-on-a-chip” and “point-of-care” (“LOC and POC”), highly portable analysis machinery for field, clinic and office applications. 
● | Speed: We believe our rapid assay design system software provides shorter time to product release. This has been demonstrated with the conception, design, product manufacture, clinical verification and submission for a CE Mark for our Logix Smart coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test being approximately 30 days. 
● | Accuracy: We believe our tests are more sensitive and specific than competitors’ and can detect more strains of viruses. 
● | Exclusivity: We own all patents and all intellectual property used in preparation of our tests. 
● | Personalized Medicine: We project that rising health care costs in developed and developing nations will increasingly require that health care systems be patient specific to eliminate waste, misdiagnoses, and ineffectiveness. A critical component will be accurate, more affordable DNA-based diagnostics, which we plan to offer. 
● | Low-cost Provider: We plan to keep our overhead low. Our platform technology obviates the need to pay patent royalties typically required of our competitors, which use patented test platforms to design their tests.

● | Worldwide Footprint: With a dynamic technology that encompasses markets worldwide, we anticipate that we can identify the best target markets, not only in high burden developing countries (HBDC’s) but also in developed nations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Growth Industry Category: We believe that DNA testing is the fastest-growing segment of in-vitro diagnostic testing. 
● | Combination Product Offering: Our ultra-sensitive tests can be a well-designed match for a new generation of handheld and other small point-of-care (POC) devices now entering the market. Used together, these affordable tests and devices may revolutionize the molecular diagnostics industry in cost, speed of test results and simplification. 
● | Multi-plexing: Our existing multiplexed tests demonstrate that our CoPrimer designed tests are able to test for multiple targets in the same sample without the distortion caused by false negatives and false positives that generally occur in multiplexed tests. 

Liquid Biopsy for Cancer Screening
 
The development of liquid biopsy tests is expected to spur low-cost testing in many countries. We believe that our liquid biopsy cancer screening may be ready for testing in the foreseeable future. Medical applications of our SNP detection technology can determine the presence of cancer cells or cell-free genetic material in a liquid or tissue biopsy, and to determine the distinct type of cancer involved. A real-life example of this includes being able to identify specific mutation(s) in genes linked to breast cancer in order to determine a patient’s prognosis, initiate the most effective and affordable treatment and to determine whether chemotherapy is necessary. After diagnosis the relative cost of our technology would allow for frequent testing to measure the effectiveness of the treatment and thus could be a companion diagnostic for a range of treatments.
 
Our technology has for all practical purposes essentially eliminated, primer-dimers, which opens up some very unique applications for liquid biopsy for cancer detection. Our ability to multiplex the reaction in testing for several DNA targets allows technicians to detect multiple cancers as free-circulating DNA fragments or whole cells in a blood sample at the same time
 
Agricultural Applications
 
SNP detection is also used in the agricultural industry to identify variations in crop genomes to achieve improved seed viability and other desired characteristics, including drought resistance, disease resistance, pest resistance and higher yield.
 
In mid-2017, the Company was first approached by a large agribusiness to evaluate our ability to multiplex certain target genomes. The results of the development project have successfully demonstrated our ability to not only multiplex the target genomes, but targeted SNP’s as well. The project was undertaken in conjunction with the manufacturer of our CoPrimer tests. The results of the project encouraged the parent of our manufacturer to seek a world-wide licensing arrangement for our CoPrimers in the agricultural industry, which was completed in October 2018. Pursuant to the exclusive license for the agronomics industry, the licensee pays us a royalty for all CoPrimers sold to the licensee’s customers. In January 2019, the licensee formally introduced the product at a large agricultural conference and has branded the product under the name “BHQ CoPrimers”.
 
Additional Licensing and Assay Development
 
In addition, the unique properties of our CoPrimer technology make them ideally suited to a variety of applications where sensitivity is key to optimal results, including multiplexing several targets, enhanced SNP detection and enrichment for next generation sequencing. Our licensee for our agricultural testing requested an expansion of our license agreement to include test design services for their customers and potential customers, both in the infectious disease arena as well as for agricultural customers. The license was amended in July 2019 and we expect to derive a license fee from our licensee for its design services. If any of its customers desire to commercialize the tests designed, they will need to seek a commercial license directly from us. Because of these unique characteristics of CoPrimers, research companies and institutions have requested that we design diagnostics to locate and identify uncommon gene sequences and SNPs and create tests for the target sequences in a multiplexed reaction. This application of our technology is in its beginning stages, but we believe that the results from our initial research indicate a significant step forward in defining the capabilities of our technology, which we believe can be translated to revenue producing licensing arrangements.

Intellectual Property
 
Because much of our future success and value depends on our proprietary technology, our patent and intellectual property strategy is of critical importance. Five of our initial U.S. patents related to our technology have been granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), including the patent for our CoPrimer technology, which we consider our most important patent. One of our patents has been issued in Great Britain, but is still pending in the United States. As of March 2021, we had two additional patents pending in the U.S. and foreign counterpart applications. Two of our issued US patents expire in 2034, one in 2036 and one in 2038.
 
We have identified additional applications of the technology, which represent potential patents that further define specific applications of the processes that are covered by the original patents. We intend to continue building our intellectual property portfolio as development continues and resources are available.
 
We have copyrighted our development software that is used by us to develop diagnostic tests based on our technology. We have allowed one potential customer access to our development software and intend to sell customized reagents through that customer to labs serviced by that customer throughout the world. To date we have not sold any products to that customer.
 
Major Customers
 
We had certain customers which were each responsible for generating 10% or more of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Two customers together accounted for approximately 38% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. These customers may not account for the same percentage of sales in future periods. If we were to sell nothing to those customers in the future, it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition unless we were able to replace those customers with others.
Competition
 
The molecular diagnostics industry is extremely competitive. There are many firms that provide some or all of the products we provide and provide many diagnostic tests that we have yet to develop. Many of these competitors are larger than us and have significantly greater financial resources. Because we are not established, many of our competitors have a competitive advantage in the diagnostic testing industry because they also have other lines of business in the pharmaceutical industry from which they derive revenues and for which they are well known and respected in the medical profession. We will need to overcome the disadvantage of being a start up with no history of success and no significant respect from the medical and testing professionals, although this is changing as we continue to market our LogixSmart COVID-19 tests and other tests in the United States to well-known and successful laboratories. In the diagnostic testing industry, we compete with such companies as BioMerieux, Siemens, Qiagen, and Cepheid and with such pharmaceutical companies as Abbott Laboratories, Becton Dickinson and Johnson and Johnson.
 
Many of these competitors already have an established customer base with industry standard technology, which we must overcome to be successful.
 
Competition is, and will likely continue to be, particularly intense in the market for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Numerous companies in the United States and internationally have announced their intention to offer new products, services and technologies that could be used in substitution for our LogixSmart COVID-19 tests. Many of those competitors are significantly larger, and have substantially greater financial, engineering and other resources, than our company. Existing and potential competitors in the market for COVID-19 diagnostic tests include developers of both serological and molecular tests. We also compete with companies from Asia in certain markets who are willing to sell their tests for much less than we sell our tests, which creates price pressure on us to reduce the price of tests to compete.
 

10
--


We expect competition to continue to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the market, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products, services and technologies are introduced. The entrance of new competitors is being encouraged by governmental authorities, who are offering funding to support development of testing solutions for COVID-19. Some of our existing or new competitors may have strong relationships with current and potential customers, including governmental authorities, and, as a result, may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing regulatory requirements, new or emerging technologies, and changes in customer requirements.
 
Government Regulation
 
In the United States, we are regulated by the FDA and our products must be approved by the FDA before we will be allowed to sell our tests in the United States. However, the FDA granted us an EUA to manufacture and sell our Logix Smart COVID-19 test to CLIA labs in the United States. Because our lab is ISO certified, we are allowed to apply for CE-Marking, which will allow us to sell any CE Marked test in most countries in Europe, South America and Asia. We currently have CE Marks issued for our Logix Smart COVID-19 test, tuberculosis test, our Zika virus test, a triplex test that tests for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya simultaneously and a triplex test that distinguishes between Flu A, Flu B and Covid-19. In addition, our Logix Smart COVID-19 has received the license to manufacture and sell in India from India’s CDSCO and the National Epidemiology Institute in Mexico evaluated our Logix Smart COVID-19 test and approved it for sale in Mexico. We have also received approval to sell in Australia. We are in the process of registering for sale our Logix Smart COVID-19 test in a number of major countries around the world.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 37 full-time employees at our executive offices and lab facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah, and two employees outside of Utah. We have engaged independent contractors in India to promote the use of our products and develop outlets for products and employ the services of independent sales representatives on an “as needed” basis.
Organizational History and Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated as Co-Diagnostics, Inc., in Utah on April 18, 2013. Our principal executive office is located 2401 S. Foothill Drive, Salt Lake City, Utah 84109. Our telephone number is (801) 438-1036. Our web address is www.codiagnostics.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of July 12, 2017, the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under applicable SEC rules. We expect that we will remain an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future, but cannot retain our emerging growth company status indefinitely. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 herein as the “JOBS Act”. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from specified disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:

● | being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | not being required to comply with the requirement of auditor attestation of our internal controls over financial reporting; 


11
--


● | not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and 
● | not being required to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

 
For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of that classification. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock.
 
An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public reporting companies.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available for smaller reporting companies.
