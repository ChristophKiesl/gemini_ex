ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

The Company 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). In addition, we have elected to be treated, and expect to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. From our formation in 2012 through December 31, 2020, we originated more than $4.21 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
 “Unitranche” loans are first lien loans that may extend deeper in a company’s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in the unitranche loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the “first-out” portion of such loan and retain the “last-out” portion of such loan, in which case, the “first-out” portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the “last-out” portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the “last-out” portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the “first-out” portion. We use the term “mezzanine” to refer to debt that ranks senior only to a borrower’s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower’s other indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company. 
 We invest primarily in U.S. middle-market companies, which we believe are underserved by traditional providers of capital such as banks and the public debt markets. In this report, we generally use the term “middle market companies” to refer to companies with between $5 million and $200 million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) excluding certain one-time, and non-recurring items that are outside the operations of these companies. However, we may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies. We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from various loan origination and other fees, dividends on direct equity investments and capital gains on the sales of investments. Fees received from portfolio companies (directors’ fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief therefrom, we only receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another client account managed by our Investment Adviser (including Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit LLC (“GS PMMC”) and Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit II LLC (“GS PMMC II”), collectively with other accounts managed by our Investment Adviser, the “Accounts”). The companies in which we invest use our capital for a variety of purposes, including to support organic growth, fund acquisitions, make capital investments or refinance indebtedness. 
 The Merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp.
 On October 12, 2020, we completed our previously announced merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. (“GS MMLC”) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of June 11, 2020. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GS MMLC common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share of GS MMLC common stock, that number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), with a net asset value (“NAV”) equal to the NAV per share of GS MMLC common stock, in each case calculated as of October 9, 2020. As a result of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. In connection with the Merger, GSAM reimbursed each of us and GS MMLC, in each case in an amount of $4.00 million, for all fees and expenses incurred and payable by us or GS MMLC, in connection with or related to the Merger (including all documented fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, experts and consultants to us or the special committee of our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), on the one hand, or GS MMLC or the special committee of its board of directors, on the other hand). For more information about the Merger, see Note 13 “Merger with GS MMLC” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Investment Strategy 
 Our origination strategy focuses on leading the negotiation and structuring of the loans or securities in which we invest and holding the investments in our portfolio to maturity. In many cases we are the sole investor in the loan or security in our portfolio. Where there are multiple investors, we generally seek to control or obtain significant influence over the rights of investors in the loan or security. We generally seek to make investments that have maturities between three and ten years and range in size between $10 million and $75 million, although we may make larger or smaller investments on occasion. 
Investment Portfolio 
 Our portfolio (excluding our investment in a money market fund, if any, managed by an affiliate of Group Inc.) consisted of the following:
 
 
 | December 31, 2020 | 
--------------------------------+-------------------+---------
 | Amortized Cost | | Fair Value | | | Percentage of Total Portfolio at Fair Value
 | (in millions) | | | | 
First Lien/Senior Secured Debt | $ | 2,489.28 | | $ | 2,526.97 | | 78.0 | %
First Lien/Last-Out Unitranche | | 138.96 | | | 143.23 | | 4.4 |

Total Investments | $ | 3,182.58 | | $ | 3,242.77 | | 100.0 | %

 As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of 265 investments in 123 portfolio companies across 39 different industries. The largest industries in our portfolio, based on fair value as of December 31, 2020, were Health Care Technology, Software, Interactive Media & Services and Health Care Providers & Services, which represented 10.5%, 10.1%, 8.4% and 7.9%, respectively, of our portfolio at fair value. The geographic composition of our portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2020 was United States 97.6%, Ireland 1.6%, Canada 0.8%, Germany 0.0% and Singapore 0.0%. 
 
The weighted average yield by asset type of our total portfolio (excluding our investment in a money market fund, if any, managed by an affiliate of Group Inc.), at amortized cost and fair value, was as follows: 
  
 | December 31, 2020 | 
--------------------------------------+-------------------+-----
 | Amortized Cost | | | Fair Value
Weighted Average Yield(1) | | | | | | 
First Lien/Senior Secured Debt(2) | | 8.3 | % | | 8.6 | %

(1) | The weighted average yield at amortized cost of our portfolio excludes the purchase discount and amortization related to the Merger and does not represent the total return to our stockholders.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Computed based on (a) the annual actual interest rate or yield earned plus amortization of fees and discounts on the performing debt and other income producing investments as of the reporting date, divided by (b) the total investments (including investments on non-accrual and non-income producing investments) at amortized cost or fair value. This calculation excludes exit fees that are receivable upon repayment of certain loan investments.

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash (“net debt”) owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments and excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company, and compare that amount to EBITDA (“interest coverage ratio”). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 
Median EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 
Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. As of December 31, 2020, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 33.1% of total debt investments. Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the respective reported end date. Portfolio company statistics have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount.
 
Corporate Structure 
 We were formed as a private fund in September 2012 and commenced operations in November 2012, using seed capital contributions we received from Group Inc. In March 2013, we elected to be treated as a BDC. We have elected to be treated, and expect to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. On March 18, 2015, our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “GSBD”. On March 23, 2015, we closed our initial public offering (“IPO”), issuing 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $20.00 per share. Net of offering and underwriting costs, we received cash proceeds of $114.57 million. On April 21, 2015, we issued an additional 900,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in connection with the IPO. On May 24, 2017, we sold 3,250,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. Net of underwriting costs and offering expenses, we received cash proceeds of $69.65 million. On May 26, 2017, we issued an additional 487,500 shares of our common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of the option to purchase additional shares that we granted in connection with the May 24, 2017 sale of our common stock. Net of underwriting costs, we received additional cash proceeds of $10.64 million. On October 12, 2020, as a result of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, Group Inc. owned 6.39 % of our common stock. 
Our Investment Adviser 
 GSAM serves as our Investment Adviser and has been registered as an investment adviser with the SEC since 1990. Subject to the supervision of our Board of Directors, a majority of which is made up of independent directors (including an independent Chairman), GSAM manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory and management services and certain administrative services. 
 GSAM is a subsidiary of Group Inc., a public company that is a bank holding company (a “BHC”), financial holding company (a “FHC”) and a world-wide, full-service financial services organization. Group Inc. is the general partner and owner of GSAM. GSAM has been providing financial solutions for investors since 1988 and had over $1.9 trillion of assets under supervision as of December 31, 2020.

The GSAM Private Credit Group 
 The Private Credit Group of GSAM (the “GSAM Private Credit Group”) is responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring and servicing our investments. The GSAM Private Credit Group was comprised of 28 investment professionals, as of December 31, 2020, all of whom are dedicated to our investment strategy and other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company. The GSAM Private Credit Group sits with a broader team known as the “GSAM Credit Alternatives Team” which has additional responsibilities other than those relating to the us. In addition, GSAM has risk management, legal, accounting, tax, information technology and compliance personnel, among others, who provide services to us. We benefit from the expertise provided by these personnel in our operations. 
 The GSAM Private Credit Group is dedicated primarily to private corporate credit investment opportunities in North America and utilizes a bottom-up, fundamental research approach to lending. The senior members of the GSAM Private Credit Group have been working together since 2006 and have an average of over 19 years of experience in leveraged finance and private transactions. 
 Investment Committee 
 
All investment decisions are made by the investment committee of GSAM’s Private Credit Group (the “Investment Committee”), which currently consists of five voting members: Brendan McGovern, Jon Yoder, David Yu, Jordan Walter and Michael Mastropaolo, as well as three non-voting members with operational and/or legal expertise. The Investment Committee is responsible for approving all of our investments. The Investment Committee also monitors investments in our portfolio and approves all asset dispositions. We expect to benefit from the extensive and varied relevant experience of the investment professionals serving on the Investment Committee, which includes expertise in privately originated and publicly traded leveraged credit, stressed and distressed debt, bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions and private equity. The voting members of the Investment Committee collectively have over 50 years of experience in middle-market investment and activities related to middle-market investing. The membership of the Investment Committee may change from time to time. 
 The purpose of our Investment Committee is to evaluate and approve, as deemed appropriate, all investments by our Investment Adviser. Our Investment Committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of our Investment Committee’s members to the analysis and consideration of every investment. Our Investment Committee also serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our Investment Adviser’s investment philosophies and policies. Our Investment Committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements. 
 In addition to reviewing investments, our Investment Committee meetings serve as a forum for discussing credit views and outlooks, as well as reviewing investments. Potential transactions and investment opportunities are also reviewed on a regular basis. Members of our Investment Adviser’s investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credits with our Investment Committee early in their analysis. This process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently.
 Investments 
 We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. We expect to make investments through both primary originations and open-market secondary purchases. We currently do not limit our focus to any specific industry. If we are successful in achieving our investment objective, we believe that we will be able to provide our stockholders with consistent dividend distributions and attractive risk adjusted total returns. 
 As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio (which term does not include our investment in a money market fund managed by an affiliate of Group Inc.) on a fair value basis, was comprised of approximately 96.5% secured debt investments (82.4% in first lien debt (including 4.4% in first lien/last-out unitranche loans) and 14.1% in second lien debt), 0.0% in unsecured debt investments, 1.5% in preferred stock, 2.0% in common stock and 0.0% in warrants. We expect that our portfolio will continue to include secured debt, including first lien, unitranche, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, unsecured debt (including mezzanine debt) and, to a lesser extent, equities. In addition to investments in U.S. middle-market companies, we may invest a portion of our capital in opportunistic investments, such as in large U.S. companies, foreign companies, stressed or distressed debt, structured products or private equity. Such investments are intended to enhance our risk adjusted returns to stockholders, and the proportion of these types of investments will change over time given our views on, among other things, the economic and credit environment in which we are operating, although these types of investments generally will constitute less than 30% of our total assets. 
 In the future, we may also securitize a portion of our investments in any or all of our assets. We expect that our primary use of funds will be to make investments in portfolio companies, distribute cash to holders of our common stock and pay our operating expenses, including debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities to fund our investments.

On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted GS PMMC, GS MMLC (which was merged with us on October 12, 2020), GS PMMC II and us exemptive relief to co-invest with other funds managed by the GSAM Credit Alternatives investment team in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Additionally, if our Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future, we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the exemptive relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. 
 Investment Criteria 
 We are committed to a value-oriented philosophy implemented by our Investment Adviser, which manages our portfolio and seeks to minimize the risk of capital loss without foregoing the potential for capital appreciation. We have identified several criteria, discussed below, that GSAM believes are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. 
 These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions. However, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we choose to invest. Generally, we seek to use our experience and access to market information to identify investment candidates and to structure investments quickly and effectively. 
  
• | Value orientation and positive cash flow. Our investment philosophy places a premium on fundamental analysis and has a distinct value orientation. We focus on companies in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of operating cash flow and that are profitable at the time of investment on an operating cash flow basis. Typically, we do not expect to invest in start-up companies or companies having speculative business plans.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Experienced management and established financial sponsor relationships. We generally require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also require the portfolio companies to have proper incentives in place to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors. In addition, we focus our investments in companies backed by strong financial sponsors that have a history of creating value and with whom members of our Investment Adviser have an established relationship.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong and defensible competitive market position. We seek to invest in target companies that have developed leading market positions within their respective markets and are well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities. We also seek companies that demonstrate significant competitive advantages versus their competitors, which should help to protect their market position and profitability while enabling us to protect our principal and avoid capital losses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Viable exit strategy. We seek to invest in companies that GSAM believes will provide a steady stream of cash flow to repay our loans and reinvest in their respective businesses. We expect that such internally generated cash flow, leading to the payment of interest on, and the repayment of the principal of, our investments in portfolio companies to be a key means by which we exit from our investments over time. In addition, we also seek to invest in companies whose business models and expected future cash flows offer attractive exit possibilities. These companies include candidates for strategic acquisition by other industry participants and companies that may repay our investments through an initial public offering of common stock or other capital markets transactions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Due diligence. Our Investment Adviser takes a bottom-up, fundamental research approach to our potential investments. It believes it is critical to conduct extensive due diligence on investment targets and in evaluating new investments. Our Investment Adviser conducts a rigorous due diligence process that is applied to prospective portfolio companies and draws from its experience, industry expertise and network of contacts. In conducting due diligence, our Investment Adviser uses information provided by companies, financial sponsors and publicly available information as well as information from relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our due diligence typically includes, but is not limited to: (i) review of historical and prospective financial information; (ii) review of the capital structure; (iii) analysis of the business and industry in which the company operates; (iv) on-site visits; (v) interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company; (vi) review of loan documents; (vii) background checks; and (viii) research relating to the portfolio company’s management, industry, markets, products and services and competitors. 
 Upon the completion of due diligence and a decision to proceed with an investment in a company, the team leading the investment presents the investment opportunity to our Investment Committee. This committee determines whether to pursue the potential investment. All new investments are required to be reviewed by the Investment Committee. The members of the Investment Committee are employees of our Investment Adviser and they do not receive separate compensation from us or our Investment Adviser for serving on the Investment Committee. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf (and at our expense) by attorneys prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate.

Investment Structure 
 Once we determine that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment. We negotiate among these parties and use creative and flexible approaches to structure our investment relative to the other capital in the portfolio company’s capital structure. 
 We expect our secured debt to have terms of approximately three to ten years. We generally obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that will serve as collateral in support of the repayment of this debt. This collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. 
 We use the term “mezzanine” to refer to debt that ranks senior only to a borrower’s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower’s other indebtedness. Mezzanine debt typically has interest-only payments in the early years, payable in cash or in-kind, with amortization of principal deferred to the later years of the mezzanine debt. In some cases, we may enter into mezzanine debt that, by its terms, converts into equity (or is issued along with warrants for equity) or additional debt securities or defers payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. Typically, our mezzanine debt investments have maturities of three to ten years. 
 We also invest in unitranche loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the “first-out” portion of such loan and retain the “last-out” portion of such loan, in which case, the “first-out” portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and other amounts due thereunder over the “last-out” portion that we would continue to hold. 
 In the case of our secured debt and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt investments, we seek to tailor the terms of the investments to the facts and circumstances of the transactions and the prospective portfolio companies, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio companies to achieve their business plan and improve their profitability. For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by (i) requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; (ii) incorporating “put” rights and call protection into the investment structure; and (iii) negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights. Our investments may include equity features, such as direct investments in the equity or convertible securities of portfolio companies or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights. 
 We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment but may sell certain investments earlier if a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale or refinancing of a portfolio company. We also may turn over our investments to better position the portfolio as market conditions change.
 Allocation of Opportunities 
 Our investment objectives and investment strategies are similar to those of other client accounts managed by our Investment Adviser (including GS PMMC and GS PMMC II), and an investment appropriate for us may also be appropriate for those Accounts. This creates potential conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other Accounts, particularly in circumstances where the availability of such investment opportunities is limited, where the liquidity of such investment opportunities is limited or where co-investments by us and other Accounts are not permitted under applicable law. 
 We are prohibited under the Investment Company Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors (“Independent Directors”) and, in some cases, of the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of our outstanding voting securities is our affiliate for purposes of the Investment Company Act, and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any assets from or to, or entering into certain “joint” transactions (which could include investments in the same portfolio company) with such affiliates, absent the prior approval of the Independent Directors. Our Investment Adviser and its affiliates, including persons that control, or are under common control with, us or our Investment Adviser, are also considered our affiliates under the Investment Company Act, and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any assets from or to, or entering into “joint” transactions with, such affiliates without exemptive relief from the SEC.

Subject to applicable law, we may invest alongside Goldman Sachs and its Accounts. In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments by us and other Accounts may be made only pursuant to an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. Together with our Investment Adviser, GS PMMC, GS MMLC (which was merged with us on October 12, 2020) and GS PMMC II, we applied for and received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions with certain affiliates (including GS PMMC and GS PMMC II), each of whose investment adviser is GSAM. After the date of the exemptive order, co-investments may be made subject to certain conditions, including that co-investments are made in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions, as well as regulatory requirements and pursuant to the conditions required by the exemptive relief and the co-investments are allocated fairly among participants. As a result of such order, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of GS PMMC, GS PMMC II and/or other funds managed by our Investment Adviser. If our Investment Adviser identifies an investment and we are unable to rely on our exemptive relief for that particular opportunity, our Investment Adviser will be required to determine which Accounts should make the investment at the potential exclusion of other Accounts. In such circumstances, the Investment Adviser will adhere to its investment allocation policy in order to determine the Account to which to allocate the opportunity. The policy provides that our Investment Adviser allocate opportunities through a rotation system or in such other manner as our Investment Adviser determines to be equitable. Accordingly, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by other Accounts. 
 We may also invest alongside other Accounts advised by our Investment Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff guidance and interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such Accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other Accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Investment Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of its other clients, negotiates no term other than price. We may also invest alongside our Investment Adviser’s other clients as otherwise permissible under SEC staff guidance and interpretations, applicable regulations and the allocation policy of our Investment Adviser. 
 To address these potential conflicts, our Investment Adviser has developed allocation policies and procedures that provide that personnel of our Investment Adviser making portfolio decisions for Accounts will make purchase and sale decisions and allocate investment opportunities among Accounts consistent with its fiduciary obligations. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these policies and procedures may result in the pro rata allocation of limited opportunities across eligible Accounts managed by a particular portfolio management team, but in many other cases the allocations reflect numerous other factors as described below. Accounts managed outside of the GSAM Private Credit Group are generally viewed separately for allocation purposes. There will be cases where certain Accounts receive an allocation of an investment opportunity when we do not and vice versa. 
 In some cases, due to information barriers that are in place, other Accounts may compete with us for specific investment opportunities without being aware that we are competing against each other. Goldman Sachs has a conflicts system in place above these information barriers to identify potential conflicts early in the process and determine if an allocation decision needs to be made. If the conflicts system detects a potential conflict, the legal and compliance departments of Goldman Sachs assess investment opportunities to determine whether a particular investment opportunity is required to be allocated to a particular Account (including us) or is prohibited from being allocated to a particular Account. Subject to a determination by the legal and compliance departments (if applicable), portfolio management teams are then charged with ensuring that investment opportunities are allocated to the appropriate Account. 
 Personnel of our Investment Adviser involved in decision-making for Accounts may make allocation related decisions for us and other Accounts by reference to one or more factors, including: the Account’s portfolio and its investment horizons, objectives, guidelines and restrictions (including legal and regulatory restrictions); strategic fit and other portfolio management considerations, including different desired levels of investment for different strategies; the expected future capacity of the applicable Accounts; limits on our Investment Adviser’s brokerage discretion; cash and liquidity considerations; and the availability of other appropriate investment opportunities. Suitability considerations, reputational matters and other considerations may also be considered. The application of these considerations may cause differences in the performance of different Accounts that have similar strategies. In addition, in some cases our Investment Adviser may make investment recommendations to Accounts where the Accounts make the investment independently of our Investment Adviser, which may result in a reduction in the availability of the investment opportunity for other Accounts (including us) irrespective of our Investment Adviser’s policies regarding allocation of investments. Additional information about our Investment Adviser’s allocation policies is set forth in Item 6 (“Performance-based Fees and Side-by-Side Management—Side-by-Side Management of Advisory Accounts; Allocation of Opportunities”) of our Investment Adviser’s Form ADV. 
 Our Investment Adviser, including the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team, may, from time to time, develop and implement new trading strategies or seek to participate in new investment opportunities and trading strategies. These opportunities and strategies may not be employed in all Accounts or may be employed pro rata among Accounts, even if the opportunity or strategy is consistent with the objectives of such Accounts. 
 During periods of unusual market conditions, our Investment Adviser may deviate from its normal trade allocation practices. For example, this may occur with respect to the management of unlevered and/or long-only Accounts that are typically managed on a side-by-side basis with levered and/or long-short Accounts.

We may or may not receive opportunities referred by Goldman Sachs businesses and affiliates, but in no event do we have any rights with respect to such opportunities. Subject to applicable law, including the Investment Company Act, such opportunities or any portion thereof may be offered to other Accounts, Goldman Sachs, all or certain investors in us, or such other persons or entities as determined by Goldman Sachs in its sole discretion. We will have no rights and will not receive any compensation related to such opportunities. Certain of such opportunities may be referred to us by employees or other personnel of GS & Co., or by third-parties. If we invest in any such opportunities, GS & Co. or such third-parties may be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the Investment Company Act, to compensation from us or from the borrowers in connection with such investments. Any compensation we pay in connection with such referrals will be an operating expense and will accordingly be borne by us (and will not serve to offset any Management Fee or Incentive Fee (each as defined below) payable to the Investment Adviser). 
 In connection with certain of our investments, following our Investment Adviser’s determination that the appropriate portion of an applicable investment opportunity has been offered to us and other Accounts in accordance with the Investment Adviser’s allocation policy and applicable legal requirements, including the Investment Company Act and, if applicable, the terms of the SEC exemptive order on co-investments disclosed herein (collectively, “Applicable Law”), we and/or our Investment Adviser may have the opportunity to offer all or a portion of the excess amounts of such investment opportunity to other persons or entities. These opportunities include, for example, where our Investment Adviser has determined that while it is in our best interests to acquire the full amount of an investment available to it if the alternative is to not make the investment at all, it is further in our best interests of, due to diversification, portfolio management, leverage management, investment profile, risk tolerance or other exposure guidelines or limitations, cash flow or other considerations, for us to hold less economic exposure to the investment than such full amount. Subject to Applicable Law, such opportunities may be structured as an investment alongside us or as a purchase of a portion of the investment from us (through a syndication, participation or otherwise). 
 In all cases, subject to Applicable Law, our Investment Adviser has broad discretion in determining to whom and in what relative amounts to offer such opportunities, and factors our Investment Adviser may take into account, in its sole discretion, include whether such potential recipient is able to assist or provide a benefit to us in connection with the potential transaction or otherwise, whether our Investment Adviser believes the potential recipient is able to execute a transaction quickly, whether the potential recipient is expected to provide expertise or other advantages in connection with a particular investment, whether our Investment Adviser is aware of such potential recipient’s expertise or interest in these types of opportunities generally or in a subset of such opportunities or, the potential recipient’s target investment sizing. Recipients of these opportunities may, in accordance with Applicable Law, include one or more investors in us, one or more investors in other funds managed by the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team, clients or potential clients of Goldman Sachs, or funds or accounts established for any such persons. These opportunities may give rise to potential conflicts of interest. These opportunities will be offered to the recipients thereof on such terms as our Investment Adviser determines in its sole discretion, subject to Applicable Law, including on a no-fee basis or at prices higher or lower than those paid by us. As a result of these and other reasons, returns with respect to an opportunity may exceed investors’ returns with respect to our investment in the same opportunity. 
 For a further explanation of the allocation of opportunities and other conflicts and the risks related thereto, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our Business and Structure—Potential conflicts of interest with other businesses of Goldman Sachs could impact our investment returns.” 
 Market Opportunity 
 The GSAM Private Credit Group believes there is an attractive investment opportunity to invest in U.S. middle-market companies. Specifically: 
  
• | The middle-market represents a large target market opportunity. According to the National Center for the Middle Market and the CIA World Factbook, the U.S. middle market is comprised of approximately 200,000 companies that represent approximately 33% of the private sector gross domestic product, employing approximately 48 million people.1 The GSAM Private Credit Group believes that there is an attractive investment environment for GSBD to provide loans to U.S. middle market companies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There have been secular changes in ownership structures of middle-market companies. The GSAM Private Credit Group has observed a transformation in the ownership structures of private and public companies. The number of U.S. private-equity companies is at its highest level since 2000. Conversely, the number of listed U.S. domestic companies has dramatically declined over the same time period, yet the average market capitalization of listed U.S. companies has grown. The GSAM Private Credit Group believes that this has resulted in a shift in the ownership of middle-market companies and thus creating a larger market opportunity for us to provide debt capital to the companies that we expect to target.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There is a large amount of un-invested private equity capital for middle-market companies. There is a large amount of un-invested private equity capital for North America buyout funds. The GSAM Private Credit Group believes this creates additional capacity for us as the GSAM Private Credit Group expects private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with debt capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes in business strategy by banks have further reduced the supply of capital to middle-market companies. The trend of consolidation of regional banks into money center banks has reduced the focus of these businesses on middle-market lending. Money center banks traditionally focus on lending and providing other services to large corporate clients to whom they can deploy larger amounts of capital more efficiently. The GSAM Private Credit Group believes that this has resulted in fewer bank lenders to U.S. middle-market companies and reduced the availability of debt capital to the companies that we expect to target.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1 | Estimate for 2020 by the National Center for the Middle Market, which defined middle market as companies with annual revenue of $10 million—$1 billion. See http://www.middlemarketcenter.org.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | The capital markets have been unable to fill the void in middle-market finance left by banks. While underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets have been robust in recent years, middle-market companies are rarely able to access these markets as participants are generally highly focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond or loan being issued. For example, mutual funds and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are significant buyers of underwritten bonds and broadly syndicated loans. However, mutual funds and ETFs generally require the ability to liquidate their investments quickly in order to fund investor redemptions. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for their investments is an important consideration in the initial investment decision. Because there is typically no active secondary market for the debt of U.S. middle-market companies, mutual funds and ETFs generally do not provide capital to U.S. middle-market companies. The GSAM Private Credit Group believes that this is likely to be a persistent problem for the capital markets and creates an advantage for investors like us who have a more stable capital base and can therefore invest in illiquid assets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | It is difficult for new lending platforms to enter the middle market and fill the capital void because it is very fragmented. While the middle market is a very large component of the U.S. economy, it is a highly fragmented space with thousands of companies operating in many different geographies and industries. Typically, companies that need capital find lenders and investors based on pre-existing relationships, referrals and word of mouth. Developing the many relationships and wide-spread recognition required to become source of capital to the middle market is a time consuming, highly resource-intensive endeavor. As a result, the GSAM Private Credit Group believes that it is difficult for new lending platforms to successfully enter the middle market, thereby providing insulation from rapid shifts in the supply of capital to the middle market that might otherwise disrupt pricing of capital.

Competitive Advantages 
 The Goldman Sachs Platform: Group Inc. is a leading global financial institution that provides a broad range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base, including companies and high net worth individuals, among others. The firm is headquartered in New York, and maintains offices across the United States and in all major financial centers around the world. Group Inc.’s asset management subsidiary, GSAM, is one of the world’s leading investment managers with over 702 investment professionals and approximately $1.9 trillion in assets under supervision as of December 31, 2020.2 GSAM’s investment teams, including the GSAM Private Credit Group, capitalize on the relationships, market insights, risk management expertise, technology and infrastructure of Goldman Sachs. The GSAM Private Credit Group believes the Goldman Sachs platform delivers a meaningful competitive advantage in the following ways: 

• | Origination of Investment Opportunities: Goldman Sachs has a preeminent network of relationships and the ability to provide valued intellectual, as well as financial, capital to middle-market borrowers which the GSAM Private Credit Group believes significantly enhances its origination capability. The GSAM Private Credit Group believes that many borrowers prefer to do business with Goldman Sachs and its advised funds because of its ability to offer further services to middle-market companies as they grow in their life cycle, including financial advice, acquisition opportunities and capital markets expertise. The GSAM Private Credit Group is also able to leverage the Goldman Sachs platform to provide borrowers with access to Goldman Sachs’ broad client network, which can be utilized to find new customers and partners as they seek to grow and execute their strategic plans.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluation of Investment Opportunities: The GSAM Private Credit Group is comprised of seasoned professionals with significant private credit investing experience. The team draws on a diverse array of skill sets, spanning fundamental credit and portfolio management, as well as legal and transactional structuring expertise. The GSAM Private Credit Group is trained in, and utilizes, proprietary investment practices and procedures developed over many decades by Goldman Sachs, including those related to performing due diligence on prospective portfolio investments and reviewing the backgrounds of potential partners. Further, Goldman Sachs is an active participant in a wide array of industries, both in service to clients operating in many different industries and acting as a principal or customer in such industries. Accordingly, Goldman Sachs houses a tremendous amount of industry knowledge and experience. Subject to internal information barriers and related limitations, the GSAM Private Credit Group is able to draw upon these industry insights and expertise as it evaluates investment opportunities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Risk Monitoring of Investments: The GSAM Private Credit Group has significant processes and procedures in place, including proprietary information technology systems, to monitor and evaluate the performance of its investments at the asset level. In addition, the GSAM Private Credit Group benefits from Goldman Sachs’ extensive risk management capabilities, which have been developed and honed over many investment cycles. The GSAM Private Credit Group’s portfolio is regularly reviewed and stressed under various scenarios by senior risk management personnel within Goldman Sachs. These scenarios are drawn from the expertise developed by Goldman Sachs for its own balance sheet. This risk monitoring is designed to minimize the risk of capital loss and maintain an investment portfolio that is expected to perform in a broad range of economic conditions.

Operating and Regulatory Structure 
 We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act. As a BDC, we are generally prohibited from acquiring assets other than qualifying assets unless, after giving effect to any acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets generally include securities of eligible portfolio companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. Under the rules of the Investment Company Act, “eligible portfolio companies” include (i) private U.S. operating companies, (ii) public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange (e.g., the NYSE) or registered under the Exchange Act, and (iii) public U.S. operating companies having a market capitalization of less than $250 million. Public U.S. operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board and through OTC Markets Group Inc. are not listed on a national securities exchange and therefore are eligible portfolio companies. 
 We have elected to be treated, and expect to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. As a RIC, we generally will not be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends if we meet certain source of income, distribution and asset diversification requirements. We intend to timely distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our annual taxable income for each year, except that we may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and we may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable tax. In addition, the distributions we pay to our stockholders in a year may exceed our net ordinary income and capital gains for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Distributions.” 
 Ongoing relationships with portfolio companies 
 Monitoring 
 Our Investment Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 

• | assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system is as follows: 
  
• | Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly, and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments graded 3 or 4, the Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. 
 13
 

Managerial Assistance 
 As a BDC, we must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of our eligible portfolio companies within the meaning of Section 55 of the Investment Company Act. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Investment Adviser or an affiliate thereof may provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request such assistance. We may receive fees for these services. See “—Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies.” 
Competition 
 Our primary competitors provide financing to middle-market companies and include other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), private funds, including hedge funds, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Some of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. 
 In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act imposes on us as a BDC. 
 While we expect to use the industry information of GSAM’s investment professionals to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies, we do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer and GSAM believes that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. Rather, we compete with our competitors based on our reputation in the market, our existing investment platform, the seasoned investment professionals of our Investment Adviser, our experience and focus on middle-market companies, our disciplined investment philosophy, our extensive industry focus and relationships and our flexible transaction structuring. 
 Staffing 
 We do not currently have any employees. Our day-to-day operations are managed by our Investment Adviser. Our Investment Adviser has hired and expects to continue to hire professionals with skills applicable to our business plan, including experience in middle-market investing, leveraged finance and capital markets. 
Properties 
 We do not own any real estate or other properties materially important to our operations. Our principal executive offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate for our business as it is contemplated to be conducted. 
Legal Proceedings 
 We and our Investment Adviser are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, although we may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. 
Our Administrator 
 Pursuant to our Administration Agreement, our administrator is responsible for providing various accounting and administrative services to us. Our administrator is entitled to fees as described in “—Administration Agreement.” To the extent that our administrator outsources any of its functions, the administrator will pay any compensation associated with such functions. See “—Administration Agreement.” 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 We have a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by our Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the plan. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Due to regulatory considerations, Group Inc. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan, and GS & Co. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan in respect of any shares of our common stock acquired through our 10b5-1 plan (the “10b5-1 Plan”). For further details, see Note 9 “Net Assets” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.  
 All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to the plan agent at Computershare Trust Company, N.A, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233, with overnight correspondence being directed to the plan agent at Computershare Trust Company, N.A, 462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202; by calling 855-807-2742; or through the plan agent’s website at www.computershare.com/investor. Participants who hold their shares through a broker or other nominee should direct correspondence or questions concerning the dividend reinvestment plan to their broker or nominee.

Management Agreements 
 Investment Management Agreement 
 We have entered into an investment management agreement (as amended and restated as of June 15, 2018, the “Investment Management Agreement”) with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser manages our investment program and related activities. 
Management Services 
 Pursuant to the terms of our Investment Management Agreement, GSAM, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, manages our day-to-day investment-related operations and provides investment management services to us. 
 Subject to compliance with applicable law and published SEC guidance, nothing contained in the Investment Management Agreement in any way precludes, restricts or limits the activities of our Investment Adviser or any of its respective subsidiaries or affiliated parties. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our Business and Structure—Our Investment Adviser, its principals, investment professionals and employees and the members of its Investment Committee have certain conflicts of interest.” 
 Management Fee 
 We pay the Investment Adviser a management fee (the “Management Fee”), which accrues and is payable quarterly in arrears. The Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% (0.25% per quarter), in each case, of the average value of our gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents (such as investments in money market funds) but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, Management Fees amounted to $16.85 million, of which the Investment Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive $3.81 million. As of December 31, 2020, $5.95 million remained payable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Management Fees amounted to $14.70 million. 
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”) payable to our Investment Adviser consists of two components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. 
 A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on our income and a portion is based on our capital gains, each as described below. Our Investment Adviser is entitled to receive the Incentive Fee based on income from us if our Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeds a quarterly “hurdle rate” of 1.75%. For this purpose, the hurdle is computed by reference to our NAV and does not take into account changes in the market price of our common stock. 
 Beginning with the calendar quarter that commenced on January 1, 2015, the Incentive Fee based on income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to our aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2015) (such period, the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”). The Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined and paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year by reference to an Annual Period (as defined below). 
 The hurdle amount for the Incentive Fee based on income is determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to 1.75% multiplied by our NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all issuances by us of shares of our common stock, including issuances pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Incentive Fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income. For the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income, we pay our Investment Adviser a quarterly Incentive Fee based on the amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income (“Ordinary Income”) in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount.” Ordinary Income is net of all fees and expenses, including the Management Fee but excluding any Incentive Fee.
The Incentive Fee based on income for each quarter is determined as follows: 
  
• | No Incentive Fee based on income is payable to our Investment Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the “Catch-up Amount,” determined as the sum of 2.1875% multiplied by our NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20% of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15
 

The amount of the Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to our Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is equal to the excess of the Incentive Fee so calculated minus the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below). 
 The Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to our Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
 “Cumulative Net Return” means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss (as defined below), if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, we will pay no Incentive Fee based on income to our Investment Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to our Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we will pay an Incentive Fee based on income to our Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to our Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we will pay an Incentive Fee based on income to our Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 “Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. 
 The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income:

 Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains. The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated on an annual basis. For the period beginning on January 1 of each calendar year and ending on December 31 of the calendar year or, in the case of our first and last year, the appropriate portion thereof (each, an “Annual Period”), we pay our Investment Adviser an Incentive Fee equal to (A) 20% of the difference, if positive, of the sum of our aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of our aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and our aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from April 1, 2013 until the end of such Annual Period minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to our Investment Adviser from April 1, 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, unrealized capital appreciation is excluded from the calculation in clause (A), above. 
 We accrue, but not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we are required to accrue an Incentive Fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, we consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then we record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the avoidance of doubt, the Incentive Fee examples below reflect the calculation of the Incentive Fee payable under the Investment Management Agreement rather than accruals of the Incentive Fee as required by GAAP. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to $35.85 million. As of December 31, 2020, $2.67 million remained payable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to $9.22 million. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we did not accrue any Incentive Fees based on capital gains.

In connection with the Merger, GSAM has agreed to waive a portion of its Incentive Fee based on income to the extent incurred, for a period of nine quarters, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and through and including the quarter ending December 31, 2021, otherwise payable by us under the Investment Management Agreement by and between us and GSAM, as applicable, for each such quarter in an amount sufficient to ensure that our net investment income per weighted share outstanding for such quarter is at least $0.48 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, GSAM agreed to waive $23.07 million and $0.39 million of Incentive Fees. Additionally, GSAM voluntarily agreed to waive $10.11 million of Incentive Fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to the purchase discount resulting from the Merger.

 Determination of Incentive Fee based on income 
 In Quarter 1, the Ordinary Income of $6.0 million exceeds the Hurdle Amount of $1.75 million and the Catch-up Amount of $2.1875 million. There are no Net Capital Losses. As a result, an Incentive Fee based on income of $1.2 million ((100% of $437,500) + (20% of $3,812,500)) is payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 1. 
 In Quarter 2, the Ordinary Income of $1.5 million does not exceed the Hurdle Amount of $1.75 million, but the aggregate Ordinary Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $7.5 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $3.5 million and the aggregate Catch-up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $4.375 million. There are no Net Capital Losses. As a result, an Incentive Fee based on income of $300,000 ($1.5 million ((100% of $875,000) + (20% of 3,125,000)) minus $1.2 million paid in Quarter 1) is payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 2. 
 In Quarter 3, the aggregate Ordinary Income of the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $9.5 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $5.25 million and the aggregate Catch-up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $6.5625 million. However, there is an aggregate Net Capital Loss of ($4.0) million for the Trailing Twelve Quarters. As a result, the Incentive Fee Cap would apply. The Incentive Fee Cap equals $(400,000), calculated as follows: (20% x ($9.5 million minus $4.0 million)) minus $1.5 million paid in Quarters 1 and 2. Because the Incentive Fee Cap is a negative value, there is no Incentive Fee based on income payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 3. 
 In Quarter 4, the aggregate Ordinary Income of the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $13.0 million exceeds the aggregate Hurdle Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $7.0 million and the aggregate Catch-up Amount for the Trailing Twelve Quarters of $8.75 million. The calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income would be $1.1 million ($2.6 million (100% of $1.75 million) + (20% of $4.25 million) minus $1.5 million paid in Quarters 1 and 2). However, there is an aggregate Net Capital Loss of ($1.0) million for the Trailing Twelve Quarters. As a result, the Incentive Fee Cap would apply. The Incentive Fee Cap equals $900,000 calculated as follows: (20% x ($13.0 million minus $1.0 million)) minus $1.5 million. Because the Incentive Fee Cap is positive but less than the Incentive Fee based on income of $1.1 million calculated prior to applying the Incentive Fee Cap, an Incentive Fee based on income of $900,000 is payable to our Investment Adviser for Quarter 4.

Examples of Calculation of Incentive Fee based on Capital Gains 
 Assumptions 
  
• | Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $25 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 2: Investment A sold for $30 million, fair value of Investment B determined to be $25 million and fair value of Investment C determined to be $27 million
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 3: fair value of Investment B determined to be $29 million and Investment C sold for $30 million
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Year 4: fair value of Investment B determined to be $40 million
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 Determination of Incentive Fee based on capital gains 
 The Incentive Fee based on capital gains, if any, would be: 
  
• | Year 1: None
--+-------------


• | Year 2: $1.0 million
--+---------------------

 The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains equals (A) 20% of the difference, if positive, of the sum of our aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of our aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and our aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, if any, in each case from April 1, 2013 until the end of the applicable Annual Period minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to our Investment Adviser from April 1, 2013. 
 Therefore, using the assumptions above, the Incentive Fee based on capital gains equals (A) 20% x ($10.0 million—$5.0 million) minus (B) $0. 
 Therefore, the Incentive Fee based on capital gains equals $1.0 million. 
  
• | Year 3: $1.8 million, which is calculated as follows:
--+------------------------------------------------------

 The Incentive Fee based on capital gains equals (A) 20% x ($15.0 million—$1.0 million) minus (B) $1.0 million. 
 Therefore, the Incentive Fee based on capital gains equals $1.8 million. 
  
• | Year 4: $200,000, which is calculated as follows:
--+--------------------------------------------------

 The Incentive Fee based on capital gains equals (x) (A) 20% x ($15.0 million—$0 million) minus (B) $2.8 million. 
 Therefore, the Incentive Fee based on capital gains equals $200,000. 
 Board Approval of the Investment Advisory and Management Agreement 
 Our Board of Directors determined at a virtual meeting held on August 4, 2020 to approve the continuation of the Investment Management Agreement. In its consideration of the renewal of the Investment Management Agreement, the Board of Directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things: (i) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to us by the Investment Adviser; (ii) the contractual terms of the Investment Management Agreement, including the structure of the Management Fee imposed on gross assets (excluding cash) and the Incentive Fee imposed on net investment income and capital gains; (iii) comparative data with respect to the advisory fees and other expenses paid by other externally managed BDCs with similar investment objectives and strategies; (iv) information about the services performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Management Agreement; (v) comparative data with respect to our investment performance and the performance of other BDCs with comparable investment objectives and strategies; (vi) the Investment Adviser’s revenues and pre-tax profit margins with respect to its management of us; (vii) any existing and potential benefits to the Investment Adviser or its affiliates from its relationship with us; (viii) other potential benefits to us as a result of our relationship with the Investment Adviser; and (ix) such other matters as the Board of Directors determined were relevant to their consideration of the Investment Management Agreement. 
 In connection with their consideration of the renewal of the Investment Management Agreement, our Board of Directors gave weight to each of the factors described above, but did not identify any one particular factor as controlling their decision. After deliberation and consideration of all of the information provided, including the factors described above, the Board of Directors concluded, in the exercise of their business judgment, that the management fees paid by us were reasonable in light of the services provided to us by the Investment Adviser, the Investment Adviser’s costs, and our current and reasonably foreseeable asset levels. The Board of Directors unanimously concluded that the Investment Adviser’s continued management likely would benefit us and our stockholders and that the Investment Management Agreement should be approved and continued with respect to us until August 31, 2021. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid our Investment Adviser a total of $21.46 million in fees pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, which consisted of $14.48 million in Management Fees and $6.98 million in Incentive Fees. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid our Investment Adviser a total of $12.60 million in fees pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, which consisted of $10.75 million in Management Fees and $1.85 million in Incentive Fees. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid our Investment Adviser a total of $10.83 million in fees pursuant to GS MMLC’s investment management agreement with the Investment Adviser, which consisted of $4.16 million in Management Fees and $6.67 million in Incentive Fees, and which were assumed in the Merger. The investment advisory agreement between the Investment Adviser and GS MMLC was terminated in connection with the closing of the Merger.

Duration and Termination 
 The Investment Management Agreement will remain in full force and effect for successive annual periods, but only so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (a) the vote of a majority of our Independent Directors and (b) by a vote of a majority of our Board of Directors or of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, as defined in the Investment Company Act. The Investment Management Agreement may, on 60 days’ written notice to the other party, be terminated in its entirety at any time without the payment of any penalty, by our Board of Directors, by vote of a majority of our outstanding voting stock or by our Investment Adviser. The Investment Management Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Competition—We are dependent upon management personnel of our Investment Adviser for our future success.” 
 Limitation of Liability of Our Investment Adviser and the Company 
 The Investment Management Agreement provides that our Investment Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by us in connection with the matters to which the Investment Management Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from our Investment Adviser’s willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by our Investment Adviser of its obligations and duties under the Investment Management Agreement. Any person, even though also employed by our Investment Adviser, who may be or become an employee of and paid by us will be deemed, when acting within the scope of such employment, to be acting in such employment solely for us and not as our Investment Adviser’s employee or agent. These protections may lead our Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our Business and Structure—Our Investment Adviser will be paid the Management Fee even if the value of your investment declines and our Investment Adviser’s Incentive Fee may create incentives for it to make certain kinds of investments.” 
 Organization of our Investment Adviser 
 Our Investment Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The principal executive offices of our Investment Adviser are located at 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282. 
 Expenses 
 Our Investment Adviser pays all costs incurred by it in connection with the performance of its duties under the Investment Management Agreement. Our Investment Adviser pays the compensation and expenses of all its personnel and makes available, without expense to us, the services of such of its partners, officers and employees as may duly be elected as our officers or directors, subject to their individual consent to serve and to any limitations imposed by law. Our Investment Adviser is not required to pay any of our expenses other than those specifically allocated to it, including as set forth below. In particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, our Investment Adviser is not required to pay: (i) our operational and organizational expenses; (ii) fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees and expenses of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; (iii) interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; (iv) fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; (v) brokers’ commissions; (vi) fees and expenses associated with calculating our NAV (including the costs and expenses of any independent valuation firm); (vii) legal, auditing or accounting expenses; (viii) taxes or governmental fees; (ix) the fees and expenses of our administrator, transfer agent or sub-transfer agent; (x) the cost of preparing stock certificates or any other expenses, including clerical expenses of issue, redemption or repurchase of our shares; (xi) the expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our shares for sale and of maintaining our registration and registering us as a broker or a dealer; (xii) the fees and expenses of our directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; (xiii) the cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our stockholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities; (xiv) costs of holding stockholder meetings; (xv) listing fees; (xvi) the fees or disbursements of custodians of our assets, including expenses incurred in the performance of any obligations enumerated by our certificate of incorporation or bylaws insofar as they govern agreements with any such custodian; (xvii) insurance premiums; or (xviii) costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business. Our Investment Adviser is not required to pay expenses of activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of our shares, including, all costs and expenses associated with the preparation and distribution of any offering memorandum, subscription agreements, registration statements, prospectuses or stockholder application forms. 
 
Our Investment Adviser may impose a voluntary cap on the amount of expenses that will be borne by us on a monthly or annual basis. Any such expense cap may be increased, decreased, waived or eliminated at any time at our Investment Adviser’s sole discretion. 
 To the extent that expenses to be borne by us pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement are paid by our Investment Adviser, we will reimburse our Investment Adviser for such expenses, provided, however, that our Investment Adviser may elect, from time to time and in its sole discretion, to bear certain of our expenses set forth above, including organizational and other expenses. 
 Transfer Agent 
 Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as our transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), dividend agent and registrar.

Administration Agreement 
 Pursuant to the Administration Agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company, our administrator, our administrator is responsible for providing various accounting and administrative services to us. The Administration Agreement provides that the administrator is not liable to us for any damages or other losses arising out of the performance of its services thereunder except under certain circumstances, and contains provisions for the indemnification of the administrator by us against liabilities to other parties arising in connection with the performance of its services to us. We pay the administrator fees for its services as we determine are commercially reasonable in our sole discretion. We also reimburse the administrator for all reasonable expenses. To the extent that our administrator outsources any of its functions, the administrator pays any compensation associated with such functions. We are not obligated to retain our administrator. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 30 days’ written notice to the other party. The terms of any administration agreement that we may enter with any subsequent administrator may differ materially from the terms of the Administration Agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company in effect prior to such retention, including providing for a fee structure that results in us, directly or indirectly, bearing higher fees for similar services and other terms that are potentially less advantageous to us. Our stockholders will not be entitled to receive prior notice of the engagement of an alternate administrator or of the terms of any agreement that is entered into with such administrator. 
License Agreement 
 We are party to a license agreement with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs pursuant to which we have been granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the “Goldman Sachs” name. Under this agreement, we do not have a right to use the Goldman Sachs name if GSAM or another affiliate of Goldman Sachs is not our Investment Adviser or if our continued use of such license results in a violation of applicable law, results in a regulatory burden or has adverse regulatory consequences. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the “Goldman Sachs” name. 
Regulation 
 We have elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act. As with other companies regulated by the Investment Company Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. The Investment Company Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, the Investment Company Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the Investment Company Act as the vote: (i) of 67% or more of the voting securities present at such meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company, whichever is less. 
 Any issuance of preferred stock must comply with the requirements of the Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act requires, among other things, that (1) immediately after issuance and before any dividend or other distribution is made with respect to our common stock and before any purchase of common stock is made, such preferred stock together with all other senior securities must not exceed an amount equal to 50% of our total assets after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, and (2) the holders of shares of preferred stock, if any are issued, must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on such preferred stock are in arrears by two full years or more. Certain other matters under the Investment Company Act require a separate class vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock. For example, holders of preferred stock would be entitled to vote separately as a class from the holders of common stock on a proposal involving a plan of reorganization adversely affecting such securities. 
 
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed a “principal underwriter” as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). We may purchase or otherwise receive warrants, which offer an opportunity (not a requirement) to purchase common stock of a portfolio company in connection with an acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, we may acquire rights that obligate an issuer of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase the securities at certain times, under certain circumstances. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company whereby our investment would exceed the limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot (1) acquire more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any registered investment company, (2) invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or (3) invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies in general. These limitations do not apply where we acquire interests in a money market fund as long as we do not pay a sales charge or service fee in connection with the purchase. With respect to the portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of our policies described above are fundamental and each such policy may be changed without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the Investment Company Act. 
 Private funds that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act are also subject to certain of the limits under the Investment Company Act noted above. Specifically, such private funds may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition). Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act are also subject to the restriction as well as other limitations under the Investment Company Act that would restrict the amount that they are able to invest in our securities. As a result, certain investors would be required to hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to such restrictions.

Qualifying Assets 
 Under the Investment Company Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets (not including certain assets specified in the Investment Company Act) represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: 

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding thirteen months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the Investment Company Act as any issuer that:
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a) | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company (“SBIC”) wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the Investment Company Act; and
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | satisfies any of the following:
----+--------------------------------


• | does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange but has an aggregate market value of outstanding common equity of less than $250 million;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC, and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own at least 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 A BDC must be organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above under “Qualifying Assets.” However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must also either control the issuer of the securities or offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance (as long as the BDC does not make available significant managerial assistance solely in this fashion). Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 
Temporary Investments 
 As a BDC, pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would generally not meet the asset diversification requirements in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.

Indebtedness and Senior Securities 
 As a BDC, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage ratio, as defined under the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 200%, or 150% if certain requirements are met, immediately after each such issuance. The Small Business Credit Availability Act modified the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act to reduce the required asset coverage ratio applicable to BDCs to 150%, subject to certain approval and disclosure requirements. On June 15, 2018, our stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us. As a result of this approval, we are now permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. In addition, except in limited circumstances, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or stock unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. A loan is presumed to be made for temporary purposes if it is repaid within 60 days and is not extended or renewed; otherwise it is presumed to not be for temporary purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. These constraints may hinder our Investment Adviser’s ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective.”
Code of Ethics 
 We have adopted a Code of Ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and we have also approved our Investment Adviser’s Code of Ethics that it adopted in accordance with Rule 17j-1 and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. These Codes of Ethics establish, among other things, procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions, including transactions in securities that are held by us. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. The Codes of Ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. Copies may also be obtained by electronic request to publicinfo@sec.gov. 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated the voting of portfolio securities to our Investment Adviser. For client accounts for which our Investment Adviser has voting discretion, our Investment Adviser has adopted policies and procedures (the “Proxy Voting Policy”) for the voting of proxies. Under the Proxy Voting Policy, our Investment Adviser’s guiding principles in performing proxy voting are to make decisions that favor proposals that tend to maximize a company’s shareholder value and are not influenced by conflicts of interest. To implement these guiding principles for investments in publicly traded equities, our Investment Adviser has developed customized proxy voting guidelines (the “Guidelines”) that it generally applies when voting on behalf of client accounts. These Guidelines address a wide variety of individual topics, including, among other matters, shareholder voting rights, anti-takeover defenses, board structures, the election of directors, executive and director compensation, reorganizations, mergers, issues of corporate social responsibility and various shareholder proposals. 
 The Proxy Voting Policy, including the Guidelines, is reviewed periodically to assure that it continues to be consistent with our Investment Adviser’s guiding principles. The Guidelines embody the positions and factors our Investment Adviser generally considers important in casting proxy votes. 
 Our Investment Adviser has retained a third-party proxy voting service (the “Proxy Service”), currently Institutional Shareholder Services, to assist in the implementation and administration of certain proxy voting-related functions including operational, recordkeeping, and reporting services. The Proxy Service also prepares a written analysis and recommendation (a “Recommendation”) of each proxy vote that reflects the Proxy Service’s application of the Guidelines to particular proxy issues. While it is our Investment Adviser’s policy generally to follow the Guidelines and Recommendations from the Proxy Service, our Investment Adviser’s portfolio management teams (the “Portfolio Management Teams”) may, on certain proxy votes, seek approval to diverge from the Guidelines or a Recommendation by following an “override” process. Such decisions are subject to a review and approval process, including a determination that the decision is not influenced by any conflict of interest. A Portfolio Management Team that receives approval through the override process to cast a proxy vote that diverges from the Guidelines and/or a Recommendation may vote differently than other Portfolio Management Teams that did not seek to override the vote. In forming their views on particular matters, the Portfolio Management Teams are also permitted to consider applicable regional rules and practices, including codes of conduct and other guides, regarding proxy voting, in addition to the Guidelines and Recommendations. Our Investment Adviser may hire other service providers to replace or supplement the Proxy Service with respect to any of the services our Investment Adviser currently receives from the Proxy Service. 
 From time to time, our Investment Adviser may face regulatory, compliance, legal or logistical limits with respect to voting securities that it may purchase or hold for client accounts, which can affect our Investment Adviser’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. Among other limits, federal, state and foreign regulatory restrictions or company specific ownership limits, as well as legal matters related to consolidated groups, may restrict the total percentage of an issuer’s voting securities that our Investment Adviser can hold for clients and the nature of our Investment Adviser’s voting in such securities. Our Investment Adviser’s ability to vote proxies may also be affected by, among other things: (i) late receipt of meeting notices; (ii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; (iv) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (v) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions; and (vi) requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting. 
 22
 

Our Investment Adviser conducts periodic due diligence meetings with the Proxy Service which include a review of the Proxy Service’s general organizational structure, new developments with respect to research and technology, work flow improvements and internal due diligence with respect to conflicts of interest. 
 Our Investment Adviser has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing its proxy voting decisions that our Investment Adviser makes on behalf of a client account and to help assure that such decisions are made in accordance with our Investment Adviser’s fiduciary obligations to its clients. These policies and procedures include our Investment Adviser’s use of the Guidelines and Recommendations from the Proxy Service, the override approval process previously discussed, and the establishment of information barriers between our Investment Adviser and other Goldman Sachs’ businesses. Notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decision of our Investment Adviser may have the effect of benefitting the interest of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of Goldman Sachs and/or its affiliates, provided that our Investment Adviser believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. 
 Voting decisions with respect to fixed income securities and the securities of privately held issuers generally will be made by our Investment Adviser based on its assessment of the particular transactions or other matters at issue. 
 Information regarding how we vote proxies relating to portfolio securities during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020 is available upon request by writing to Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc., Attention: Itai Baron, Investor Relations, 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282. 
 Privacy Principles 
 The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 We generally will not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to stockholders who purchase our common stock. We may collect nonpublic personal information regarding our existing investors from sources such as subscription agreements, investor questionnaires and other forms; individual investors’ account histories; and correspondence between us and individual investors. We may share information that we collect regarding an investor with our affiliates and the employees of such affiliates for everyday business purposes, for example, to service the investor’s accounts and, unless an investor opts out, provide the investor with information about other products and services offered by us or our affiliates that may be of interest to the investor. In addition, we may disclose information that we collect regarding investors to third parties who are not affiliated with us (i) as authorized by our investors in investor subscription agreements or our organizational documents; (ii) as required by applicable law or in connection with a properly authorized legal or regulatory investigation, subpoena or summons, or to respond to judicial process or government regulatory authorities having property jurisdiction; (iii) as required to fulfill investor instructions; or (iv) as otherwise permitted by applicable law to perform support services for investor accounts or process investor transactions with us or our affiliates. 
 Any party not affiliated with us that receives nonpublic personal information relating to investors from us is required to adhere to confidentiality agreements and to maintain appropriate safeguards to protect your information. Additionally, for officers, employees and agents of ours and our affiliates, access to such information is restricted to those who need such access to provide services to us and investors. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to seek to guard investor nonpublic personal information. For a discussion of the risks associated with cyber incidents, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Operational—Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies by causing a disruption to our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information or the confidential information of our portfolio companies and/or damage to our business relationships or the business relationships of our portfolio companies, all of which could negatively impact the business, financial condition and operating results of us or our portfolio companies.” 
 
Other 
 We may also be prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of the members of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the prohibition on transactions by BDCs with affiliates to prohibit “joint” transactions among entities that share a common investment adviser or under common control with the investment adviser. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the adviser negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. Except in certain limited circumstances, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which another client sponsored or managed by our Investment Adviser has previously invested, including GS PMMC and GS PMMC II. On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted GS PMMC, GS MMLC (which was merged with us on October 12, 2020), GS PMMC II and us, as well as certain other funds that may be managed by GSAM, including the GSAM Credit Alternatives investment team, in the future, exemptive relief to make negotiated co-investments, subject to certain terms and conditions in the exemptive relief. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our portfolio and the investment portfolios of GS PMMC, GS PMMC II and/or other funds established by the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team that are able to rely on the order. 
 As a BDC, the SEC will periodically examine us for compliance with the Investment Company Act. 
 We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company, to protect against larceny and embezzlement, covering each of our officers and employees, who may singly, or jointly with others, have access to our securities or funds. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director, officer, investment adviser or underwriter against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. 
 23
 

We and our Investment Adviser are each required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
  
• | our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our periodic reports must disclose the conclusions of our principal executive and principal financial officers about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which must be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our periodic reports must disclose whether there were any changes in our internal controls over financing reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 Compliance with Listing Requirements 
 Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “GSBD.” As a listed company on the NYSE, we are subject to various listing standards including corporate governance listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with these rules. 
Compliance with the Bank Holding Company Act 
 
As a BHC and FHC, the activities of Group Inc. and its affiliates are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and related regulations. BHCs and FHCs are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”). Because Group Inc. may be deemed to “control” us within the meaning of the BHCA, restrictions under the BHCA could apply to us as well. Accordingly, the BHCA and other applicable banking laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, and their interpretation and administration by the appropriate regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, may restrict our investments, transactions and operations and may restrict the transactions and relationships between our Investment Adviser, Group Inc. and their affiliates, on the one hand, and us on the other hand. For example, the BHCA regulations applicable to Group Inc. and us may, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain investments or the size of certain investments, impose a maximum holding period on some or all of our investments and restrict our and our Investment Adviser’s ability to participate in the management and operations of the companies in which we invest. In addition, certain BHCA regulations may require aggregation of the positions owned, held or controlled by related entities. Thus, in certain circumstances, positions held by Group Inc. and its affiliates (including our Investment Adviser) for client and proprietary accounts may need to be aggregated with positions held by us. In this case, where BHCA regulations impose a cap on the amount of a position that may be held, Goldman Sachs may utilize available capacity to make investments for its proprietary accounts or for the accounts of other clients, which may require us to limit and/or liquidate certain investments. Additionally, Goldman Sachs may in the future, in its sole discretion and without notice to investors, engage in activities impacting us and/or our Investment Adviser in order to comply with the BHCA or other legal requirements applicable to, or reduce or eliminate the impact or applicability of any bank regulatory or other restrictions on, Goldman Sachs, us or other funds and accounts managed by our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. In addition, Goldman Sachs may cease in the future to qualify as a FHC, which may subject us to additional restrictions. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the bank regulatory requirements applicable to Goldman Sachs and us, or the interpretation thereof, will not change, or that any such change will not have a material adverse effect on us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory—Our activities may be limited as a result of potentially being deemed to be controlled by a bank holding company.”

Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.
 Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2020 (continued)
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
 
 
* | Assets are pledged as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6 “Debt”. 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(+) | Represents the actual interest rate for partially or fully funded debt in effect as of the reporting date. Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by the larger of the floor or the reference to either LIBOR ("L") or alternate base rate (commonly based on the Prime Rate ("P")), at the borrower’s option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. L loans are typically indexed to 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month or 1 week L rates. As of December 31, 2020, rates for the 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month and 1 week L are 0.34%, 0.26%, 0.24%, 0.19%, 0.14% and 0.10%, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, P was 3.25%. For investments with multiple reference rates or alternate base rates, the interest rate shown is the weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2020.
(++) | The total par amount is presented for debt investments, while the number of shares or units owned is presented for equity investments. Par amount is denominated in U.S. Dollars ("$") unless otherwise noted, Euro ("€"). 
# | Percentages are based on net assets. 
^ | As defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), the investment is deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
^^ | As defined in the Investment Company Act, the investment is deemed to be a “controlled affiliated person” of the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the portfolio company’s outstanding voting securities or has the power to exercise control over management or policies of such portfolio company. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
^^^ | The investment is otherwise deemed to be an “affiliated person” of the Company. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
(1) | The investment is not a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the Investment Company Act. The Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets. As of December 31, 2020 the aggregate fair value of these securities is $96,067 or 2.90% of the Company’s total assets. 
(2) | Represent co-investments made with the Company’s affiliates in accordance with the terms of the exemptive relief received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions”. 
(3) | Position or portion thereof is an unfunded loan commitment, and no interest is being earned on the unfunded portion.

Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc.
 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
 1.ORGANIZATION 
 Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. (the “Company,” which term refers to either Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. or Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context may require) was initially established as Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital, LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company (“SMLLC”), on September 26, 2012 and commenced operations on November 15, 2012 with The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Group Inc.”) as its sole member. On March 29, 2013, the Company elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Effective April 1, 2013, the Company converted from a SMLLC to a Delaware corporation. In addition, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. 
 The Company’s investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien debt, unitranche loans, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
 Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”), a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (including its predecessors, “GS & Co.”), is the investment adviser (the “Investment Adviser”) of the Company. The term “Goldman Sachs” refers to Group Inc., together with GS & Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries. 
 On March 23, 2015, the Company completed its initial public offering and the Company’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GSBD.” 
 The Company has formed wholly owned subsidiaries, which are structured as Delaware limited liability companies, to hold certain equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies. The Company also has formed a wholly owned subsidiary, which is structured as a Delaware corporation, to effect the Merger (as defined below).
 The Merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp.
 On October 12, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. (“GS MMLC”) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of June 11, 2020.  In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GS MMLC common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share of GS MMLC common stock, that number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), with a net asset value (“NAV”) equal to the NAV per share of GS MMLC common stock, in each case calculated as of October 9, 2020.  As a result of the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. For further information, see Note 13 “Merger with GS MMLC.” 

2. | SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
---+--------------------------------

Basis of Presentation 
 The Company’s functional currency is U.S. dollars (“USD”) and these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in that currency. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to Regulation S-X. This requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These consolidated financial statements reflect normal and recurring adjustments that in the opinion of the Company are necessary for the fair statement of the results for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions included in the consolidated financial statements. 
 Certain prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification has no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or the consolidated results of operations as previously reported.
 As an investment company, the Company applies the accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies (“ASC 946”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). 
 Basis of Consolidation 
 As provided under ASC 946, the Company will not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial position and results of operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries, BDC Blocker I, LLC (formerly known as My-On BDC Blocker, LLC), GSBD Blocker II, LLC, GSBD Wine I, LLC, GSBD Blocker III LLC, MMLC Blocker I, LLC, MMLC Blocker II, LLC, MMLC Wine I, LLC, and MMLC Blocker III LLC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 94
 


The Company did not consolidate its previous equity interest in Senior Credit Fund, LLC (the “Senior Credit Fund”). For further description of the Company’s previous investment in the Senior Credit Fund, see Note 4 “Investments”. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 The Company records its investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when the Company assumes the risks for gains and losses related to that instrument. Realized gains and losses are based on the specific identification method. 
 Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums to par value on investments purchased are accreted and amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount (“OID”) and market discounts or premiums are capitalized and amortized into interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line method, as applicable. Exit fees that are receivable upon repayment of a loan or debt security are amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income, for which the Company has earned the following: 
 
 
 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+------
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | | 2018
Prepayment premiums | $ | 1,822 | | $ | 1,925 | | $ | 2,643
Accelerated amortization of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts | $ | 3,883 | | $ | 4,573 | | $ | 3,265

 
Fees received from portfolio companies (directors’ fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to the Company, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, the Company only receives its allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another account managed by the Investment Adviser. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
 Certain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the principal amount or shares (if equity) of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income. 
 Certain structuring fees, amendment fees, syndication fees and commitment fees are recorded as other income when earned. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered over time. 
 Non-Accrual Investments 
 Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management’s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to this treatment if an investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had certain investments held in four portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 0.7% and 0.3% of the total investments (excluding an investment in a money market fund, if any, managed by an affiliate of Group Inc.) at amortized cost and at fair value. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had certain investments held in three portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 2.0% and 1.0% of the total investments (excluding an investment in a money market fund, if any, managed by an affiliate of Group Inc.) at amortized cost and at fair value. 
 95
 

Investments 
 The Company carries its investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”), issued by the FASB, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices provided by independent pricing services, broker or dealer quotations or alternative price sources. In the absence of quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative price sources, investments are measured at fair value as determined by the board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Note 5 “Fair Value Measurement”. 
 The Company generally invests in illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments, of middle-market companies. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Investment Adviser day-to-day responsibility for implementing and maintaining internal controls and procedures related to the valuation of the Company’s portfolio investments. Under valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, market quotations are generally used to assess the value of the investments for which market quotations are readily available. The Investment Adviser obtains these market quotations from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available; otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Investment Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. If the Board of Directors or Investment Adviser has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quotation does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investment in accordance with valuation procedures for investments for which market quotations are not readily available. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, the valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Directors contemplate a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
  
(1) | The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The Board of Directors also engages independent valuation firms (the “Independent Valuation Advisors”) to provide independent valuations of the investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment. The Independent Valuation Advisors independently value such investments using quantitative and qualitative information provided by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and the portfolio companies as well as any market quotations obtained from independent pricing services, brokers, dealers or market dealers. The Independent Valuation Advisors also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Independent Valuation Advisors provide an opinion on a final range of values on such investments to the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. The Independent Valuation Advisors define fair value in accordance with ASC 820 and utilize valuation approaches including the market approach, the income approach or both. A portion of the portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, and all investments in the portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available, or are readily available, but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment, are reviewed at least annually by an Independent Valuation Advisor;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The Independent Valuation Advisors’ preliminary valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and the Valuation Oversight Group (“VOG”), a team that is part of the Controllers Department within the Finance Division of Goldman Sachs. The Independent Valuation Advisors’ valuation ranges are compared to the Investment Adviser’s valuations to ensure the Investment Adviser’s valuations are reasonable. VOG presents the valuations to the Private Investment Valuation and Side Pocket Working Group of the Investment Management Division Valuation Committee, which is comprised of representatives from GSAM who are independent of the investment decision making process;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | The Investment Management Division Valuation Committee ratifies fair valuations and makes recommendations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews valuation information provided by the Investment Management Division Valuation Committee, the Investment Adviser and the Independent Valuation Advisors. The Audit Committee then assesses such valuation recommendations; and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | The Board of Directors discusses the valuations and, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, determines the fair value of the investments in good faith, based on the inputs of the Investment Adviser, the Independent Valuation Advisors and the Audit Committee.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Investments in money market funds are valued at NAV per share. See Note 3 “Significant Agreements and Related Party Transactions.”

Foreign currency of $1,831 and $1,003 (acquisition cost of $1,765 and $991) is included in cash as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
 Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD on the following basis: (i) investments and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates effective on the last business day of the period; and (ii) purchases and sales of investments, borrowings and repayments of such borrowings, income, and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. 
 The Company does not isolate the portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments. Fluctuations arising from the translation of non-investment assets and liabilities are included with the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities. 
 Derivatives 
 The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the Company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies. In a foreign currency forward contract, the Company agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of one currency for another, at a pre-determined price at a future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are marked-to-market at the applicable forward rate. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities by counterparty on a net basis, not taking into account collateral posted which is recorded separately, if applicable. Notional amounts of foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities are presented separately on the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. Purchases and settlements of foreign currency forward contracts having the same settlement date and counterparty are generally settled net and any realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date. 
 The Company does not utilize hedge accounting and as such, the Company recognizes its derivatives at fair value with changes in the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company recognizes tax positions in its consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The Company reports any interest expense related to income tax matters in income tax expense, and any income tax penalties under expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 The Company’s tax positions have been reviewed based on applicable statutes of limitation for tax assessments, which may vary by jurisdiction, and based on such review, the Company has concluded that no additional provision for income tax is required in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to potential examination by certain taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The Company’s tax positions are subject to ongoing interpretation of laws and regulations by taxing authorities. 
 The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any U.S. federal income tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company’s stockholders and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
 97
 

To maintain its tax treatment as a RIC, the Company must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders for each taxable year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (generally, its net ordinary income plus the excess of its realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction). In order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company accrued excise taxes of $1,443, $1,815 and $1,589. As of December 31, 2020, $1,638 of accrued excise taxes remained payable.
Certain of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. Income tax expense, if any, is included under the income category for which it applies in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Distributions 
 Distributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company may pay distributions in excess of its taxable net investment income. This excess would be a tax-free return of capital in the period and reduce the stockholder’s tax basis in its shares. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent they are charged or credited to paid-in capital in excess of par or distributable earnings, as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise. Temporary and permanent differences are primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of certain loans and the tax characterization of income and non-deductible expenses. These differences are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation of the Company’s annual RIC tax return. Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by the Investment Adviser. The Company may pay distributions to its stockholders in a year in excess of its net ordinary income and capital gains for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company intends to timely distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that the Company may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and may carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable tax. The specific tax characteristics of the Company’s distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of the calendar year. All distributions will be subject to available funds, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to declare such distributions in future periods. 
 The Company has a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions and, for this purpose, stockholders receiving distributions in the form of stock will generally be treated as receiving distributions equal to the fair market value of the stock received through the plan; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those stockholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. Due to regulatory considerations, Group Inc. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan, and GS & Co. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan in respect of shares of the Company’s common stock acquired through its 10b5-1 plan. 
 Deferred Financing and Debt Issuance Costs 
 Deferred financing and debt issuance costs consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing of and amendments to the Company’s senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Truist Bank (formerly known as SunTrust Bank), as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, the offering of the Company’s 4.50% Convertible Notes due 2022 (the “Convertible Notes”), the offering of the Company’s 3.75% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), and the offering of the Company’s 2.875% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”). The aforementioned costs are amortized using the straight-line method over each instrument’s term. Deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility are presented separately as an asset on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Deferred debt issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes, the 2025 Notes, and the 2026 Notes are presented net against the outstanding debt balance on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. 
Deferred Offering Costs 
 The Company records expenses related to registration statement filings and applicable offering costs as deferred offering costs. To the extent such expenses relate to equity offerings, these expenses are charged as a reduction of paid-in-capital upon each such offering. Deferred offering costs are included within Other assets on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

New Accounting Pronouncements
 In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” This ASU provides optional exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The Company adopted this ASU in June 2020 and this adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 In May 2020, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC release No. 33-10786, Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses, amending certain disclosure requirements applicable to acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, including real estate operations and investment companies. The final rule is effective on January 1, 2021. Voluntary early adoption is permitted, provided that the new rules are applied in their entirety from the date of early adoption. The Company adopted this final rule in December 2020 and this adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.   
 
 
3. | SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
---+------------------------------------------------------

Investment Management Agreement 
 The Company has entered into an investment management agreement (as amended and restated as of June 15, 2018, the “Investment Management Agreement”) with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser manages the Company’s investment program and related activities. 
Management Fee 
 The Company pays the Investment Adviser a management fee (the “Management Fee”), accrued and payable quarterly in arrears. The Management Fee (i) was calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% (0.375% per quarter) (the “Original Rate”) through June 14, 2018 and (ii) is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% (0.25% per quarter) (the “New Rate”) thereafter, in each case, of the average value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Management Fee for any partial quarter (including any quarter during which both the Original Rate and the New Rate were in effect) will be appropriately prorated based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Management Fees amounted to $16,846, $14,696 and $15,971. The Investment Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive $3,806 of Management Fees for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, $5,945 remained payable.
 Incentive Fee 
 The incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”) consists of two components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. The Incentive Fee is calculated as follows: 
 A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below. The Investment Adviser is entitled to receive the Incentive Fee based on income if Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeds a quarterly “hurdle rate” of 1.75%. For this purpose, the hurdle is computed by reference to the Company’s NAV and does not take into account changes in the market price of the Company’s common stock. 
 The Incentive Fee based on income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to the Company’s aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (or if shorter, the number of quarters that have occurred since January 1, 2015) (such period the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”). The Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined and paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year by reference to an “Annual Period,” which means the period beginning on January 1 of each calendar year and ending on December 31 of such calendar year or, in the case of the first and last year, the appropriate portion thereof. 
 The hurdle amount for the Incentive Fee based on income is determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to 1.75% multiplied by the Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all of the Company’s issuances of shares of its common stock, including issuances pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Incentive Fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. 
 99
 

i. Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income 
 For the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income, the Company pays the Investment Adviser a quarterly Incentive Fee based on the amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income (“Ordinary Income”) in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount”. Ordinary Income is net of all fees and expenses, including the Management Fee but excluding any Incentive Fee. 
 The Incentive Fee based on income for each quarter is determined as follows: 
  
• | No Incentive Fee based on income is payable to the Investment Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, referred to as the “Catch-up Amount,” determined as the sum of 2.1875% multiplied by the Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20% of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The amount of the Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equals the excess of the Incentive Fee so calculated minus the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below). 
 The Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. 
 “Cumulative Net Return” means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company pays no Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap. 
 “Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. 
 ii. Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains 
 The portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated on an annual basis. For each Annual Period, the Company pays the Investment Adviser an amount equal to (A) 20% of the difference, if positive, of the sum of the Company’s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of the Company’s aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and the Company’s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from April 1, 2013 until the end of such Annual Period minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser from April 1, 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, unrealized capital appreciation is excluded from the calculation in clause (A) above. 
 The Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an Incentive Fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. 
 100
 

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 Incentive Fees based on income amounted to $35,845, $9,220 and $13,988. As of December 31, 2020, $2,665 remained payable. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company did not accrue or pay any Incentive Fees based on capital gains.
 In connection with the Merger, GSAM has agreed to waive a portion of its Incentive Fee based on income to the extent incurred, for a period of nine quarters, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and through and including the quarter ending December 31, 2021, otherwise payable by the Company under the Investment Management Agreement by and between the Company and GSAM, as applicable, for each such quarter in an amount sufficient to ensure that the Company’s net investment income per weighted share outstanding for such quarter is at least $0.48 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, GSAM agreed to waive $23,070 and $394 of Incentive Fees. Additionally, GSAM voluntarily agreed to waive $10,110 of Incentive Fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to the purchase discount resulting from the Merger.
 Administration and Custodian Fees 
 The Company has entered into an administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (the “Administrator”) under which the Administrator provides various accounting and administrative services to the Company. The Company pays the Administrator fees for its services as it determines to be commercially reasonable in its sole discretion. The Company also reimburses the Administrator for all reasonable expenses. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Administrator pays any compensation associated with such functions. The Administrator also serves as the Company’s custodian (the “Custodian”). 
 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Administrator and the Custodian of $1,151, $957 and $920. As of December 31, 2020, $468 remained payable.
 Transfer Agent Fees 
 The Company has entered into a transfer agency and services agreement pursuant to which Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as the Company’s transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”), dividend agent and registrar. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Transfer Agent of $25, $14 and $16. As of December 31, 2020, $1 remained payable.
Common Stock Repurchase Plans 
 In February 2019, the Board of Directors approved a 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan, which provided for the Company to repurchase up to $25,000 of shares of its common stock if the stock traded below the most recently announced NAV per share, subject to limitations. The plan took effect on March 18, 2019, was temporarily suspended on December 9, 2019 and expired on March 18, 2020. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock pursuant to the plan or otherwise.
 In November 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the adoption of a new common stock repurchase plan (the “10b5-1 Plan”), which provides for the Company to repurchase up to $75,000 of shares of the Company’s common stock if the stock trades below the most recently announced quarter-end NAV per share, subject to limitations. Under the 10b5-1 Plan, no purchases will be made if such purchases would cause the Company’s Debt/Equity Ratio to exceed the lower of (a) 1.30 or (b) the Maximum Debt/Equity Ratio. In the 10b5-1 Plan, “Debt/Equity Ratio” means the sum of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and the total notional value of the Company’s unfunded commitments divided by net assets, as of the most recent reported financial statement end date, and “Maximum Debt/Equity Ratio” means the sum of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and committed uncalled debt divided by net assets, as of the most recent reported financial statement end date. 
 The 10b5-1 Plan was adopted and took effect on November 9, 2020.  The 10b5-1 Plan will expire on November 9, 2021. Purchases under the 10b5-1 Plan will be conducted on a programmatic basis in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and other applicable securities laws.
 The Company’s repurchase of its common stock under the 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise may result in the price of the Company’s common stock being higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock pursuant to the plan or otherwise.    101

Due to Affiliates 
 The Investment Adviser pays certain general and administrative expenses, including legal expenses, on behalf of the Company in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $12 and $234 included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company. 
Co-investment Activity 
 In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments by the Company and other funds managed by the Investment Adviser may be made only pursuant to an order from the SEC permitting the Company to do so. On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted exemptive relief (“Exemptive Relief”) that permits the Company to co-invest with Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit LLC (“GS PMMC”), GS MMLC (which was merged with the Company on October 12, 2020), Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit II LLC (“GS PMMC II”) and certain other funds that may be managed by GSAM, including the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team, after the date of the exemptive order, subject to certain conditions including that co-investments are made in a manner consistent with the Company’s investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions, as well as regulatory requirements and pursuant to the conditions required by the Exemptive Relief, and are allocated fairly among participants. The GSAM Credit Alternatives Team is comprised of investment professionals dedicated to the Company’s investment strategy and other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company, who are responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company’s investments and monitoring and servicing the Company’s investments, together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit. Under the terms of the Exemptive Relief, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company’s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company’s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company’s stockholders and is consistent with the then-current investment objectives and strategies of the Company. As a result of the Exemptive Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company’s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of GS PMMC, GS PMMC II and/or other funds established by the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team that could avail themselves of the Exemptive Relief.

Senior Credit Fund, LLC 
 The Senior Credit Fund, an unconsolidated Delaware limited liability company, was formed on May 7, 2014 and commenced operations on October 1, 2014. The Company invested together with Cal Regents through the Senior Credit Fund. The Senior Credit Fund’s principal purpose was to make investments, either directly or indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary, Senior Credit Fund SPV I, LLC (“SPV I”), primarily in senior secured loans to middle-market companies. Each of the Company and Cal Regents were responsible for sourcing the Senior Credit Fund’s investments. Each of the Company and Cal Regents had a 50% economic ownership in the Senior Credit Fund and each had subscribed to and has fully contributed $100,000. On December 19, 2016, SPV I entered into an amended and restated credit facility (as amended, the “Asset Based Facility”), which consisted of a revolving credit facility (the “SPV I Revolving Credit Facility”), a term loan facility (the “SPV I Term Loan Facility”) and a Class B loan facility (the “SPV I Class B Facility”), with various lenders. For the Asset Based Facility, Natixis, New York Branch served as the facility agent, and State Street Bank and Trust Company served as the collateral agent. On February 27, 2019, the board of managers of the Senior Credit Fund authorized the liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Senior Credit Fund and the pro-rata distribution of its assets and liabilities to the members of the Senior Credit Fund. On May 8, 2019, the Company and Cal Regents each contributed $125,555 to the Senior Credit Fund, which was used by the Senior Credit Fund to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness, including all accrued and unpaid interest and fees, under the Asset Based Facility and to fund certain other related expenses that the Senior Credit Fund expects to incur in connection with its dissolution. The Asset Based Facility was then terminated and all liens securing the collateral under the Asset Based Facility were released and terminated. 
 Following the repayment and termination of the aforementioned Asset Based Facility, the Senior Credit Fund distributed to its members their pro rata share of the assets of the Senior Credit Fund. The pro rata portion of the assets received by the Company included senior secured loans of $215,103 and $210,088 at amortized cost and at fair value, and cash of $9,822. In addition, the Company assumed the obligation to fund outstanding unfunded commitments of the Senior Credit Fund that totaled $5,664, representing its pro rata portion of all unfunded commitments of the Senior Credit Fund at such time. The pro rata portion of the assets received by the Company have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. After the satisfaction of all remaining liabilities and the distribution of remaining assets, the Senior Credit Fund was terminated. 
 
The table below presents the selected statement of operations information for the Senior Credit Fund, which dissolved on May 8, 2019:

5. | FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
---+-----------------------

 The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price).
 The fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The levels used for classifying investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
 Basis of Fair Value Measurement 
 Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments included in Level 1 include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. 
 Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in this category include less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. 
 105
 

Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately held entities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. 
 A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies” should be read in conjunction with the information outlined below. 
 The table below presents the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs generally used in determining the fair value of Level 2 and Level 3 Instruments. 
 
 
Level 2 Instruments | Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs 
------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equity and Fixed Income | The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include commercial paper, most government agency obligations, most corporate debt securities, certain mortgage-backed securities, certain bank loans, less liquid publicly listed equities, certain state and municipal obligations, certain money market instruments and certain loan commitments. Valuations of Level 2 Equity and Fixed Income instruments can be verified to quoted prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g. indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. 
Derivative Contracts | OTC derivatives (both centrally cleared and bilateral) are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, calibration to market-clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. The Company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, voluntary and involuntary prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. OTC derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when significant inputs are corroborated by market evidence.


Level 3 Instruments | Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs 
-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bank Loans, Corporate Debt, and Other Debt Obligations | Valuations are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques, for which the significant inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market yields and recovery assumptions. The significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to credit default swaps that reference the same underlying credit risk and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotes are available. Other valuation methodologies are used as appropriate including market comparables, transactions in similar instruments and recovery/liquidation analysis. 
Equity | Recent third-party investments or pending transactions are considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate and available (i) Transactions in similar instruments; (ii) Discounted cash flow techniques; (iii) Third party appraisals; and (iv) Industry multiples and public comparables. Evidence includes recent or pending reorganizations (for example, merger proposals, tender offers and debt restructurings) and significant changes in financial metrics, including (i) Current financial performance as compared to projected performance; (ii) Capitalization rates and multiples; and (iii) Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets.

The tables below present the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of instrument, but they do not represent a range of values for any one instrument. For example, the lowest yield in 1st Lien/Senior Secured Debt is appropriate for valuing that specific debt investment, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other debt investments in this asset class. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities.

As noted above, the income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increases or decreases in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result in an increase or decrease, in the fair value. 
 The following is a summary of the Company’s assets categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On September 19, 2013, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Facility with various lenders. Truist Bank (formerly known as SunTrust Bank) serves as administrative agent and Bank of America, N.A. serves as syndication agent under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility on October 3, 2014, November 4, 2015, December 16, 2016, February 21, 2018, September 17, 2018, February 25, 2020, and November 20, 2020. 
 The aggregate committed borrowing amount under the Revolving Credit Facility is $1,695,000. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility up to $2,250,000. 
 Borrowings denominated in USD, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest (at the Company’s election) of either (i) LIBOR plus a margin of either 2.00% or (x) 1.875% (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (y) 1.75% (subject to certain borrowing base conditions) or (ii) an alternative base rate, which is the highest of 0, the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% and overnight LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus either 1.00% or (x) 0.875%  (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (y) 0.75% (subject to certain borrowing base conditions). Borrowings denominated in non-USD bear interest of LIBOR plus a margin of either 2.00%, 1.875% or 1.75% (subject to the conditions applicable to borrowings denominated in USD that bear interested based on LIBOR). With respect to borrowings denominated in USD, the Company may elect either the LIBOR, or an alternative base rate at the time of borrowing, and such borrowings may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The Company pays a fee of 0.375% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable, on February 25, 2025. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, including any that are formed or acquired by the Company in the future. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. 
 109
 

The Company’s obligations to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company’s portfolio of investments and cash, with certain exceptions. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including: (i) maintaining a minimum stockholder’s equity of $800,000 plus 25% of net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after February 25, 2020, (ii) maintaining a minimum asset coverage ratio of at least 200%, (iii) maintaining a minimum asset coverage ratio of 150% with respect to the consolidated assets (with certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries as specified therein) of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors to the secured debt of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors, (iv) maintaining a minimum Company net worth of at least $700,000, (v) maintaining a minimum liquidity test of at least 10% of the covered debt amount during any period when the adjusted covered debt balance is greater than 90% of the adjusted borrowing base, each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility, and (vi) complying with restrictions on industry concentrations in the Company’s investment portfolio. The Company is in compliance with these covenants. 
 Costs of $21,034 were incurred in connection with obtaining and amending the Revolving Credit Facility, which have been recorded as deferred financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are being amortized over the life of the Revolving Credit Facility using the straight-line method. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, deferred financing costs were $11,350 and $4,427.

Convertible Notes 
 On October 3, 2016, the Company closed an offering of $115,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured Convertible Notes, which includes $15,000 aggregate principal amount issued pursuant to the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of an over-allotment option (the “Initial Convertible Notes”). 
 On July 2, 2018, the Company closed an additional offering of $40,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the “Additional Convertible Notes” and together with Initial Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”). The Additional Convertible Notes have identical terms, are fungible with and are part of the Initial Convertible Notes. 
 The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”), as Trustee. Wells Fargo and/or its affiliates provide bank lending and distribution services to certain Goldman Sachs funds. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2022, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. In certain circumstances, the Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, based on an initial conversion rate of 40.8397 shares of the Company’s common stock per one thousand dollars principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $24.49 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the other terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. The conversion price is approximately 10.0% above the $22.26 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 27, 2016 and 16.7% above the $20.99 per share closing price of our common stock on June 26, 2018. The Company will not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity. 
 Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2021 only under the following: (1) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per one thousand dollars principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after October 1, 2021, until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances. 
 The Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes, the Company intends to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, has the option to pay the excess amount in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares), subject to the requirements of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. At the time of issuance, the values of the debt and equity components of the Initial Convertible Notes and Additional Convertible Notes were approximately 99.4% and 0.6%, and 97.9% and 2.1%. 
 110
 

The OID equal to the equity component of the Convertible Notes was recorded in “paid-in capital in excess of par” in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The Company records interest expense comprised of both stated interest and amortization of the OID. At the time of issuance, the equity components of the Initial Convertible Notes and the Additional Convertible Notes were $743 and $836. Additionally, the issuance costs associated with the Convertible Notes were allocated to the debt and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the values at the time of issuance and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs.

7. | DERIVATIVES
---+------------

 The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to help mitigate the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the value of the Company’s investments denominated in foreign currencies. 
 In order to better define its contractual rights and to secure rights that will help the Company mitigate its counterparty risk, the Company may enter into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement (“ISDA Master Agreement”) or a similar agreement with its derivative counterparties. An ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Company and a counterparty that governs OTC derivatives, including foreign currency forward contracts, and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event. The provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement typically permit a single net payment in the event of a default (close-out netting) or similar event, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty. 
 For financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Company and cash collateral received from the counterparty, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as due to/due from broker. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with counterparties that they believe to be of good standing and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s average USD notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts was $3,435. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s average USD notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts was $2,930. For the period from August 8, 2018 to December 31, 2018, the Company’s average USD notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts was $3,215.
 

The Company’s net exposure to foreign currency forward contracts by counterparty that are subject to ISDA Master Agreements or similar agreements presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities was as follows: 
 
 
 | Gross Amount of Assets | | Gross Amount of (Liabilities) | | | Net Amount of Assets or (Liabilities) | | Collateral (Received) Pledged (1) | | Net Amounts (2) |

(1) | Commitments are generally subject to borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance with covenants and certain operational metrics. These amounts may remain outstanding until the commitment period of an applicable loan expires, which may be shorter than its maturity.

(2) | Unfunded commitments denominated in currencies other than USD have been converted to USD using the exchange rate as of the applicable reporting date.

Contingencies 
 In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that provide a variety of general indemnifications. Any exposure to the Company under these arrangements could involve future claims that may be made against the Company. Currently, no such claims exist or are expected to arise and, accordingly, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications. 

9. | NET ASSETS
---+-----------

Equity Issuances 
 On October 12, 2020, in connection with the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. There were no equity issuances of the Company’s common stock during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Distributions 
 The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors, unless a stockholder elects to “opt out” of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not “opted out” of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The shares distributed by the Transfer Agent in the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan are either through (i) newly issued shares or (ii) acquired by the Transfer Agent through the purchase of outstanding shares on the open market. If, on the payment date for any distribution, the most recently computed NAV per share as of the dividend payment date is equal to or less than the closing market price plus estimated per share fees, the Transfer Agent will invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares. Otherwise, the Transfer Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired by purchasing shares on the open market. The following table summarizes the distributions declared on shares of the Company’s common stock and shares distributed pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan to stockholders who had not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan:

10.EARNINGS PER SHARE 
 The following information sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: 
 
 
 | For the Years Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | | 2018
Net increase in net assets from operations | $ | 176,113 | | $ | 36,148 | | $ | 53,678 
Weighted average shares outstanding | | 53,940,573 | | | 40,313,662 | | | 40,184,715
Basic and diluted earnings per share | $ | 3.26 | | $ | 0.90 | | $ | 1.34 

 
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per common share, the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was less than the conversion price for the Convertible Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, diluted earnings per share equal basic earnings per share because the underlying shares for the intrinsic value of the embedded options in the Convertible Notes were not dilutive.

The Company’s aggregate unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments based on cost for U.S. federal income tax purposes were as follows: 
  
 | December 31, 2020 | | | December 31, 2019 | | | December 31, 2018
---------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----------+---+-------------------+---+-----------+------------------
Tax cost | $ | 3,165,681 | | | $ | 1,426,453 | | $ | 1,429,140 | 
Gross unrealized appreciation | $ | 146,963 | | | $ | 24,149 | | $ | 12,268 | 
Gross unrealized depreciation | $ | (74,418 | ) | | $ | (82,320 | ) | $ | (65,463 | )
Net unrealized investment appreciation (depreciation) on investments | $ | 72,545 | | | $ | (58,171 | ) | $ | (53,195 | )

 
The difference between GAAP-basis and tax basis unrealized gains (losses) is attributable primarily to merger adjustments, net mark to market gains (losses) on foreign currency contracts, differences in the tax treatment of underlying fund investments, and modification of debt securities. 
 In order to present certain components of the Company’s capital accounts on a tax-basis, certain reclassifications have been recorded to the Company’s accounts. These reclassifications have no impact on the net asset value of the Company and result primarily from certain non-deductible expenses, and differences in the tax treatment of underlying fund investments.

ASC Topic 740, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”) provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax position. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Based on its analysis of its tax position for all open tax years (the current and prior years, as applicable), the Company has concluded that it does not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria of ASC 740. Such open tax years remain subject to examination and adjustment by tax authorities.

13.      MERGER WITH GS MMLC
 On October 12, 2020, the Company completed its merger with GS MMLC pursuant to the Merger Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2020. The Company was the accounting survivor of the Merger.  At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GS MMLC common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share of GS MMLC common stock, that number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with a NAV equal to the NAV per share of GS MMLC common stock, in each case calculated as of October 9, 2020.  As a result, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to the former GS MMLC stockholders. 
 The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations—Related Issues. The consideration paid to GS MMLC’s stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the “purchase discount”). The purchase discount was allocated to the cost of GS MMLC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with GS MMLC, the investments were marked to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The purchase discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.  The Merger was considered a tax-free reorganization and the Company has elected to carry forward the historical cost basis of the GS MMLC investments for tax purposes.
