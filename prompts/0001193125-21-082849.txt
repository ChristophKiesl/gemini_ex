Industry Overview 
 We focus our efforts on medical conditions that involve difficult to heal wounds and musculoskeletal injuries. Healing difficulties may arise from a variety of causes and in various types of tissue and anatomic areas. Impaired healing is commonly associated with an inability to move beyond the inflammatory stages of healing, resulting in a chronic wound or injury, an ongoing inflammatory cycle, and an inability to achieve normal tissue healing. Biofilm and other infectious conditions also play a key role in disrupting wound healing processes. Regenerative medicine is a collection of technologies aimed at generating tissue as close as possible to native or natural tissue, to replace damaged tissue and to fill or replace defects. Demand for these technologies is increasing as physician understanding of the underlying wound healing processes grows and as demographic and population health trends result in the increased prevalence of systemic comorbidities that contribute to healing problems throughout the body. 
 Our products use regenerative medicine technologies to provide solutions in the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets. Based on industry reports and management estimates, we believe that our addressable Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets totaled approximately $14.9 billion in 2018, which included an estimated $8.9 billion addressable market for Advanced Wound Care and an estimated $6.0 billion addressable market for Surgical & Sports Medicine. Within the Advanced Wound Care market in 2018, 54% of treatments were used in advanced wound dressings, 17% were used in biologics, 20% were used in negative pressure wound therapy and 9% were used in other treatments. The skin substitute market, within biologics, is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2019 to $1.4 billion in 2024. Within the Surgical & Sports Medicine market, the bone fusion sub-market accounted for approximately $2.7 billion in 2017, the tendon and ligament injuries sub-market accounted for approximately $1.0 billion in 2015 and the chronic inflammatory and degenerative condition sub-market accounted for approximately $2.4 billion in 2017. 
 Key drivers of growth in these two markets include: 
 

 | favorable global demographics and aging population;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | greater incidence of comorbidities that contribute to impaired healing, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease and smoking; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increasing acceptance of advanced technologies to treat complex wounds and musculoskeletal injuries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Wound Care Market 
 Wounds represent a large and growing burden on the public health as well as a significant cost to the health care system. Wounds are divided into two primary types, chronic and acute. It is estimated that approximately 80 million patients suffer from chronic and acute wounds globally each year, excluding surgical incisions. Chronic wounds account for most of the expenses due to their complexity and length of treatment. 
Chronic Wounds 
 Chronic wounds are wounds that have not appropriately closed after four weeks of treatment with traditional treatment such as dressings. Chronic wounds include: 
 

 | VLUs: wounds that occur in the leg veins when blood does not circulate properly to the heart.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | DFUs: open sores or wounds that occur in patients with diabetes and are commonly located on the bottom of the foot.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pressure Ulcers: localized injuries to the skin and/or underlying tissues as a result of pressure or pressure in combination with shear.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Surgical Wounds: acute wounds caused by surgical incisions that become chronic wounds if they do not heal properly.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 While the underlying etiology of these chronic wounds is different, at a cellular level many of the problems that result in failed healing are the same. These include uncontrolled inflammatory processes, shortages of cell types and growth factors secreted by cells that are critical to healing, and that result in disrupted cell signaling pathways.

 Acute Wounds 
 An acute wound is an injury that causes a rapid break in the skin and sometimes the underlying tissue. Acute wounds can be traumatic wounds, such as abrasions, lacerations, penetrating injuries and burns, or surgical wounds from surgical incisions. In contrast to chronic wounds, which would normally heal but stall due to biologic factors, acute wounds are so severe that they overwhelm the bodys normal healing capacity. Biofilm and other infectious conditions, particularly in acute wounds with a high risk of infection such as open fractures, may also pose challenges to the healing of acute wounds. According to BioMed GPS, in 2016 there were approximately 430,000 open traumatic wounds. In 2016, it is estimated that there were more than 500,000 burns that required medical treatment and approximately 40,000 burns required hospitalization. 
Relative Prevalence of Wounds 
 Our customers in outpatient wound care facilities are faced with a wide variety of types of wounds with different anatomical locations and underlying causes. Based on a retrospective cohort study of data from wound care centers from June 2008 and June 2012, the distribution of wound types in hospital outpatient wound care centers is detailed below: 
Distribution of Wound Types* 
 



* | Based on a September 2013 JAMA Dermatology published retrospective cohort study.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Due to the breadth of our wound care portfolio, our products are able to address both chronic and acute wounds across all of these wound types. 
 Our Solution 
 The wound care market includes traditional dressings such as bandages, gauzes and ointments and advanced wound care products such as mechanical devices, advanced dressings and biologics. These advanced wound care products target chronic and acute wounds not adequately addressed by traditional therapies. Our products are primarily classified as skin substitutes, which fall within the biologics category of the Advanced Wound Care market. 
 According to BIS Research, the global Advanced Wound Care market was estimated to be approximately $8.9 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 3.6% through 2024. This market consists of several product categories including advanced wound dressings, devices such as negative pressure wound therapy, or NPWT, and biologics such as skin substitute and growth factors. The approximate breakdown for these product categories in 2018 is set forth below.

 Advanced Wound Care Market 
 

Wound biologics represents one of the smallest segments of the Advanced Wound Care market, but is the fastest growing and has seen the highest level of innovation. According to BIS Research, the worldwide wound biologics market, which includes skin substitutes and growth factors, was estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2018, of which skin substitute products are estimated to represent approximately 64%. Skin substitutes, bioengineered or biologic grafts that cover skin defects and support healing, are one of the fastest growing categories of the Advanced Wound Care market. The skin substitute market, within biologics, is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2019 to $1.4 billion in 2024. Going forward, the skin substitute market is projected to continue to grow as patients with hard to heal wounds transition from other therapies to skin substitute treatment. 
 We expect this market to continue to grow at a rapid rate as physicians are educated about the use of these products and understand the benefits as compared to other currently marketed products, payers incentivize doctors to use more cost effective treatments, patients demand more effective treatment solutions and advanced wound care becomes more common outside of the United States. We also believe that adoption of these products will increase as clinical evidence supporting the benefits of skin substitutes over traditional therapies continues to grow. Skin substitutes have demonstrated improved chronic and acute wound healing rates at a lower overall cost than the current standard of care. In a matched cohort study we commissioned, Medicare treatment costs for DFUs treated with Apligraf were $5,253 (p=0.49) lower per patient than the standard of care and for DFUs treated with Dermagraft, these costs were $6,991 (p=0.84) lower per patient than the standard of care. See Rice et al. Economic outcomes among Medicare patients receiving bioengineered cellular technologies for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. J Med Econ. 2015;18(8):586-95.
Our products compete with other skin substitutes as well as other advanced wound care products such as NPWT and growth factors. Due to its market position as a skin substitute with antimicrobial properties appropriate for the treatment of wounds with biofilm or otherwise at high risk of infection, our PuraPly AM product also competes with antimicrobial dressings. Antimicrobial wound products have historically represented a more than $1 billion annual market. We are a market leader in the antimicrobial skin substitute market, and have supported the expansion of that market with our comprehensive marketing and educational campaigns. 
 Finally, the skin substitute market remains substantially underpenetrated. According to BioMed GPS, over 8.3 million wounds require medical care in the United States each year, and over 3.3 million of those wounds are difficult to heal wounds where traditional therapies are unlikely to succeed. Despite this vast need and the proven advantages of advanced wound care products in general and skin substitutes in particular, only 135,000 patients, or less than five percent, are treated with skin substitutes each year. Our internal estimates indicate that if the potentially addressable market were completely penetrated today, annual skin substitute revenue in the United States alone could exceed $9 billion. 
 We believe that we are well positioned in the skin substitute market as adoption continues to increase. According to BioMed GPS, we are one of the three largest skin substitute companies in the United States and we have an experienced and established sales force with deep relationships with clinicians, wound care centers and hospitals. We also have a diverse array of products to address the different varieties of wounds throughout the wound healing process.

 Surgical & Sports Medicine Market 
 The same demographic trends that are driving the growth of the wound care market are also driving growth in the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. This market has seen an increase in surgical volumes in part due to a higher incidence of comorbidities and chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions, such as OA and tendonitis. This volume increase is fostering increased interest in regenerative medicine products, as they can help support healing and improve outcomes in older and more challenging patient populations. 
 While our products have applicability across a wide variety of surgical specialties, our immediate surgical focus in addition to wound care is in regenerative orthobiologics. Orthobiologics are substances that orthopedic surgeons use to help injuries to bones, tendons and ligaments heal more quickly. Orthobiologic products are used to treat people with long-term disabling musculoskeletal disorders and injuries. 
 We believe our multiple regenerative technology platforms will allow us to build a broad portfolio covering the full range of needs in the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. We also plan to leverage these platforms to expand into adjacent surgical markets in the near term. In the long-term, we plan to deepen our focus on chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions, in particular OA. We intend to address patient needs in the inpatient hospital, ASC and clinic settings. We estimate the immediate addressable Surgical & Sports Medicine market for our products to be approximately $6.1 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8%. This market is growing rapidly due to an increase in spinal fusions, bone reconstruction surgeries and musculoskeletal injuries and degenerative conditions. 
 Bone Fusion 
 Spine fusion surgery involves the use of grafting material to cause two vertebral bodies to grow together into one. In the United States, medical facilities performed 667,400 spinal fusion surgeries in 2013, of which 398,300 were lumbar operations. Trauma and extremities applications, including ankle arthrodesis, now represent a bone fusion market nearly as large as the spine market. With improving fixation methods, success rates have improved across these applications. However, nonunion due to inadequate bone healing remains one of the leading causes of failure for fusion procedures. Fusion is especially challenging in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and smoking who have underlying healing deficiencies. According to Technavio, the annual market for orthobiologic products to aid in fusion exceeds $2.7 billion worldwide. 
Tendon and Ligament Injuries 
 Tendon and ligament injuries are common orthopedic conditions in an active and aging population. There are approximately 250,000 rotator cuff repairs performed in the United States annually. Additionally, in 2015, there were approximately 40,000 outpatient Achilles tendon repairs in the United States. Re-rupture and reoperation continue to be a significant source of concern with non-operative management, occurring in 4.8% of Achilles tendon repair cases and as many as 25% or more rotator cuff repair cases. Comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity, as well as age, are correlated with higher risk of failed healing and re-rupture. Regenerative tissue scaffolds may be used to support the healing of tendons, ligaments and other soft tissues. According to Technavio, the annual regenerative tissue scaffold market is estimated to exceed $1 billion. 
 
7 


 Chronic Inflammatory and Degenerative Conditions 
 Chronic inflammatory and degenerative orthopedic conditions are increasingly prevalent, driven in part by an aging demographic and higher levels of comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity. OA is the most common chronic condition of the joints, affecting approximately 27 million individuals in the United States. OA can affect multiple joints in the body, with arthritis of the knee being the most commonly treated. One in two adults will develop symptoms of knee OA during their lives. Other chronic inflammatory conditions such as Achilles and rotator cuff tendinosis and plantar fasciitis are also increasingly common. Similar to many of the other conditions that we seek to address, chronic inflammatory and degenerative orthopedic conditions are often correlated with smoking, obesity and diabetes, among other factors. Collectively, these and other related conditions were treated with an estimated 9 million injections in 2016, including steroids and hyaluronic acid, or HA. According to Technavio, the global chronic inflammatory and degenerative orthopedic market exceeded $2.4 billion in 2018. 
Our Solution 
 Conventional surgical approaches rely on mechanical fixation to temporarily approximate damaged tissues, assuming that the natural healing process will then result in a permanent repair. Patients with impaired healing may be unable to generate the necessary tissue structures, resulting in unacceptable failure rates over time. 
 In the case of bony fusion, autograft bone marrow has historically been used as a biologic to support bone healing. However, the use of autograft suffers from a number of short-comings that include donor site morbidity and varied outcomes due to the underlying health condition of the patient. Furthermore, it is a more invasive procedure leading to potentially slower healing times and side effects for the patient. 
 OA and other degenerative conditions, as well as soft tissue injuries such as tendinosis and fasciitis, are currently treated by injection with steroids or HA. However, steroids offer pain relief for only a limited period and have been shown to further degrade some types of tissues over time, worsening the underlying condition. The evidence of HAs efficacy has been questioned, and it is clear that a significant percentage of patients do not respond to HA treatment. Patients who fail these less invasive therapies have limited options and may require surgical intervention, including total joint replacement. 
 Orthobiologics have been shown to be an effective alternative to traditional treatments. Due to their anti-inflammatory and pro-healing effects, they go beyond mechanical intervention to support the healing process in the damaged tissue and often result in faster healing times and shorter hospital stays. The orthobiologics market includes bone morphogenetic protein, viscosupplementation with HA, synthetic bone graft substitutes and stem cell therapy, in addition to DBM and allograft. The majority of our current and planned products in the Surgical & Sports Medicine space are based on amniotic technologies. There is a rapidly growing body of clinical and scientific evidence indicating the potential of these products in surgical applications, particularly in orthobiologics, resulting in increased adoption of these products. According to estimates from BioMed GPS, the amniotic orthobiologics market was $88 million in 2016 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 22% through 2021. 
 Our Products 
 Advanced Wound Care 
 In the Advanced Wound Care market, we focus on the development and commercialization of a broad portfolio of cellular and acellular wound care offerings that treat patients from the earliest indication of impaired healing to wound closure. Our suite of products helps treat a wide range of wounds, including, but not limited to, chronic wounds such as VLUs, DFUs, and pressure ulcers and acute wounds such as traumatic wounds and burns. 
 The breadth and depth of our portfolio allow physicians to tailor solutions to meet the needs of individual wound care patients. Wounds of all types normally progress through predictable phases of healing, starting with inflammation, progressing to cell proliferation and finally remodeling to form normal skin. Wounds may stall during this process, typically in the inflammatory phase, for a variety of reasons. These reasons include biofilm or infection, uncontrolled inflammatory processes, shortages of cell types and growth factors secreted by cells that are critical to healing and disrupted cell signaling pathways. 
 It is increasingly recognized that addressing biofilm is an important step in healing any wound. Biofilm is generated by densely packed microbial communities that are attached to the wound surface and enclosed in a matrix of self-produced extracellular polymeric substance, or EPS. Biofilm is present in at least 78% of chronic wounds and can inhibit healing of all wound types. We engage with the physician at the earliest indication of impaired healing with our PuraPly AM product, which helps control biofilm as an antimicrobial barrier via the broad spectrum antimicrobial PHMB. If reduction of biofilm and control of the excessive inflammatory response is sufficient to result in healing, as is often the case, PuraPly AM may be the only product required to achieve wound closure. If underlying healing issues persist, we offer an array of bioactive products and amniotic wound coverings tailored for a wide variety of wound sizes and types.

Affinity 
 Affinity is a fresh, amniotic allograft wound covering and surgical barrier for application in the care of chronic and acute wounds or surgical implantation in spine, orthopedic and sports medicine applications. We believe Affinity is one of only a few amniotic tissue products containing viable amniotic cells, and is unique in that it undergoes our proprietary AlloFresh process that hypothermically stores the product in its fresh state, never dried or frozen, which retains its native benefits and structure. Regulated as a human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based product, or HCT/P, under Section 361 of the PHSA, these products are referred to as Section 361 HCT/Ps, or simply 361 HCT/Ps. Affinity was launched in 2014 by NuTech Medical and acquired by us in 2017.

 Apligraf 
 Apligraf is a bioengineered bi-layered skin substitute that is the only product that has, to date, received PMA approval for the treatment of both VLUs and DFUs. Launched in 1998, Apligraf drives faster healing and more complete wound closure through its tissue engineered structure, which includes an outer layer of protective skin cells (human epidermal keratinocytes), and an inner layer of cells (human dermal fibroblasts) contained within a collagen matrix. Apligraf is the leading skin substitute product for the treatment of VLUs, and its effectiveness has been established based on an extensive clinical history with approximately 960,000 units shipped. We believe Apligraf is also the first and only wound-healing therapy to demonstrate in a randomized controlled trial, or RCT, a significant change in patients VLU wound tissue, showing a shift from a non-healing gene profile to a healing-profile. Apligraf plays an active role in healing by providing the wound with living human skin cells, growth factors and other proteins produced by the cells, and a collagen matrix. 
Dermagraft 
 Dermagraft is a dermal substitute grown from human dermal fibroblasts and has received PMA approval for the treatment of DFUs. Launched in 2001 by Smith & Nephew and acquired by us in 2014, this product helps to restore the compromised wound bed to facilitate healing. The living cells in Dermagraft produce many of the same proteins and growth factors that support the healing response in healthy skin. In addition to an FDA-monitored RCT demonstrating its superiority to conventional therapy in the healing of DFUs, studies based on real-world electronic health records and Medicare data have demonstrated its superior clinical efficacy and value as compared to competitive wound care products and conventional therapy. Dermagraft can be applied weekly (up to eight times) over a twelve-week period and does not need to be removed from the wound during this period because it contains a temporary mesh fabric that is dissolvable and becomes part of the bodys own healing processes. As part of our long-term plan to consolidate manufacturing operations in Massachusetts, we anticipate that manufacturing of Dermagraft will be suspended in the fourth quarter of 2021 and that sales of Dermagraft will be suspended in the first quarter of 2022. We currently plan to transition our Dermagraft manufacturing to our Massachusetts based manufacturing facilities following the expiration of the lease for our California based manufacturing facility, which we expect will result in substantial long-term cost savings. In the period when Dermagraft is not available, we expect our sales force will be able to drive substitution from Dermagraft to Apligraf and our amnion products and that the suspension of Dermagraft sales will not have a material impact on our net revenue. 
 NuShield 
 NuShield is a dehydrated placental tissue wound covering and surgical barrier that is topically or surgically applied to the target tissue to support native healing. Regulated as a 361 HCT/P, NuShield is processed using our proprietary LayerLoc process, which preserves the native structure of the amnion and chorion membranes, including the intermediate or spongy layer, and their native structural and regulatory proteins. NuShield is available in multiple sizes, can be used as a wound covering to help support native healing of chronic and acute wounds of many sizes, and can be stored at room temperature with a five-year shelf life. NuShield was launched in 2010 by NuTech Medical and acquired by us in 2017. 
 PuraPly Antimicrobial 
 PuraPly Antimicrobial, or PuraPly AM, was developed to address the challenges posed by bioburden and excessive inflammation in the wound. Functioning as an antimicrobial barrier skin substitute, PuraPly AM is a purified native porcine type I collagen matrix embedded with polyhexamethylene biguanide, or PHMB, a localized broad spectrum antimicrobial. PuraPly AM was launched in 2016 and has received 510(k) clearance for the management of multiple wound types, including partial and full-thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds, trauma wounds, draining wounds, and first- and second-degree burns. The combination of PHMB with a native collagen matrix helps manage bioburden while supporting healing across a wide variety of wound types, regardless of severity or duration. We also developed and received 510(k) clearance for PuraPly without PHMB, which we refer to as PuraPly, for those patients who do not require an antimicrobial agent. Line extensions include PuraPly XT, which contains additional layers of collagen matrix and a higher level of PHMB. Extra-fenestrated (EF) versions of the products allow for added conformability and fluid drainage.

 NuCel 
 NuCel is a surgically implanted allograft derived from human amniotic tissue and cells derived from amniotic fluid. NuCel is used primarily in spinal and orthopedic surgical applications to support tissue healing, including bone growth and fusion. The target indication for NuCel is lumbar spine interbody fusion. The amniotic tissue harvesting process protects key biologic characteristics of the tissue that support healing. Several published clinical studies have provided preliminary evidence of the clinical efficacy of NuCel. While NuCel is currently marketed as a 361 HCT/P, efforts are ongoing to initiate a clinical program to secure BLA approval for the product. NuCel was launched in 2009 by NuTech Medical and acquired by us in 2017. 
 ReNu 
 ReNu is a cryopreserved suspension derived from human amniotic tissue and cells derived from amniotic fluid, formulated for office use. It has been used to support healing of soft tissues, particularly in degenerative conditions such as OA and joint and tendon injuries such as tendinosis and fasciitis. The target indication for ReNu is for the treatment of Knee Osteoarthritis. A pilot clinical study of ReNu for knee OA has been published, which we believe is indicative of its safety. The results of this study also suggest potential efficacy for a period of more than a year. While ReNu is currently marketed as a 361 HCT/P, efforts are ongoing to secure BLA approval for the product, with a Phase 3 pivotal study currently underway. Management believes BLA approval may facilitate a significant incremental sales opportunity for ReNu. ReNu was launched in 2015 by NuTech Medical and acquired by us in 2017. 
 Affinity, NuShield and PuraPly AM 
 We also market our Affinity and NuShield products for surgical and orthopedic applications. These products may be used as a surgical barrier or as an on-lay or wrap barrier to support soft tissue repairs. The native biological characteristics of these amniotic tissues when used as barrier membranes may help support the healing of soft tissue defects, particularly in difficult-to-heal locations or challenging patient populations. In addition, we market our PuraPly AM product as an antimicrobial barrier for the management of open wounds in the surgical setting. 
 Bone Allograft Products 
 Our bone allograft products, which are derived from donated human cadaveric bone, include FiberOS and OCMP. Each of these products is used as a bone void filler, primarily in orthopedic and neurosurgical applications requiring bony fusion, such as spinal fusions and foot and ankle fusions. FiberOS is a blend of demineralized cortical fibers, mineralized cortical powder, and demineralized cortical powder and OCMP is a freeze-dried allograft cancellous (spongy or mesh-like) and demineralized cortical mixture. These products are typically sold as an ancillary product together with our amniotic product NuCel. 
 Ongoing Clinical Studies 
 We believe gathering robust and comprehensive clinical and real-world outcomes data is an essential component of developing a competitive product portfolio and driving further penetration in the markets where we compete. We have six ongoing studies. We continue to invest in generating clinical data for our Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products, and believe such data enhance sales efforts with physicians and reimbursement dynamics with payers over time. The tables below summarize the status of our recent clinical studies for our Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products.

 Recently Published Clinical Studies 
 PuraPly AM 
 In a published 24-week study of the use of PuraPly AM in the management of bioburden and treatment of chronic, non-healing wounds (n=63), 90% of wounds demonstrated a reduction in area and 68% of wounds achieved complete closure (mean time to complete closure of 5.0 weeks). The wounds studied included 29% venous ulcers, 22% trauma and laceration, 16% post-surgical wounds, 13% pressure ulcers and 10% diabetic ulcers. The median wound area was 6.5cm2 and the mean wound duration was 4 months. 
 Affinity 
 In a published randomized controlled clinical trial of Affinity for use in diabetic foot ulcers comparing the use of Affinity and the standard of care (n=38) to the use of the standard of care alone (n=38), 60% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved wound closure at 12 weeks compared to 38% of wounds in the standard of care group and 63% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved wound closure at 16 weeks compared to 38% of wounds in the standard of care group. In addition: 82% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved a greater than 60% reduction in wound area as compared to 58% of wounds in the standard of care group; 65% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved a greater than 60% reduction in wound depth as compared to 39% in the standard of care group; and 81% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved a greater than 75% reduction in wound volume as compared to 58% in the standard of care group. 
 NuShield 
 In a published clinical study of clinical experience using NuShield for the management of 50 wounds (VLUs (n=14), DFUs (n=24) and other wounds (n=12)), 45 (90%) of the wounds had wound closure percentages between 60% to 100%. The median time to complete wound closure (or healing) for all wounds was 102 days (14.6 weeks), and the percent healing rate of all wounds healed at 16 and 24 weeks was 56% and 73%, respectively. For DFUs treated with NuShield, the median time to healing was 120 days (17.1 weeks) and the percent healing rates at 16 and 24 weeks were 43% and 59%, respectively. For VLUs treated with NuShield, the median time to healing was 90 days (12.9 weeks), with percent healing rates of 56% and 85% at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively. For all other wounds treated with NuShield (including pressure ulcers, nonhealing surgical, ischemic, mixed etiology, and nonhealing amputation), the median time to healing was 48 days (6.9 weeks), with percent healing rates of 57% and 100% at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively. 
 ReNu 
 In a 200 patient randomized controlled multicenter single-blind study comparing the treatment of knee OA symptoms with ReNu (n=68), a commercially available hyaluronic acid, or HA (n=64), and saline (n=68), patients treated with ReNu reported a statistically significant reduction in pain and higher OMERACT-OARSI responder rate at 6 months follow-up than patients treated with HA or saline.

NuCel 
 Published preliminary results of a study examining the use of NuCel to achieve one and two-level lumbar interbody fusion demonstrated that 97% of patients in the one-level lumbar interbody fusion group (n=38) achieved kinematic fusion and 100% of patients in the two-level lumbar interbody fusion group (n=34) achieved kinematic fusion. Baseline comorbidities were present in 90% of patients in the one-level lumbar interbody fusion group and 88% of patients in the two-level interbody fusion group and no adverse events related to NuCel were reported. 
 TransCyte 
 In a published study of the safety and efficacy of TransCyte for the treatment of partial thickness burns, the mean timing to achieve greater than 90% wound epithelialization was 11 days for patients treated with TransCyte as compared to 18 days for patients treated with silver sulfadiazine cream. 
 Previously Published Clinical Studies for FDA-Approved Products 
 We also have accumulated a significant body of clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of our FDA approved products, Apligraf and Dermagraft. We continue to invest in generating similar data for other Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products, and believe such data enhance sales efforts with physicians and reimbursement dynamics with payers over time. Our product Apligraf is the only product that has obtained FDA approval for the treatment of both VLUs and DFUs. Our product Dermagraft has also received FDA approval for DFUs. Below is a summary of the primary data supporting each product, and a description of the clinical studies that are currently in progress. As used herein, p value is a measure of statistical significance. The lower the p value, the more likely it is that the results of a clinical trial or study are statistically significant rather than an experimental anomaly. Generally, to be considered statistically significant, such results must have a p value <0.05. 
Apligraf 
 Two pivotal studies were initially conducted with Apligraf demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the product in the treatment of full- and partial-thickness VLUs and DLUs. As a result, Apligraf obtained FDA approval for these indications. We have conducted a number of additional studies that provide further clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of the product, including recent comparative effectiveness, cost effectiveness and mechanism of action studies. 
 
15 


 Pivotal FDA Registration Trials 
 For the DFU indication, a multi-center prospective RCT of Apligraf for the treatment of DFUs versus standard of care was conducted. Two hundred eight patients with Type 1 and 2 diabetes were enrolled, who had a plantar DFU of full- or partial-thickness. Patients with a chronic wound that exhibited less than 30% healing prior to treatment were eligible for the clinical trial. All patients ulcers were off-loaded using either crutches or a wheelchair for the first six weeks, followed by customized pressure-relieving footwear for at least four weeks post closure. Mean ulcer size was 2.97 cm2 and 2.83 cm2 in the Apligraf and the control group, respectively. Mean duration of the ulcer was 12 months in the Apligraf group and 11 months in the control group. 
 Apligraf was significantly more effective than conventional therapy for the incidence of complete wound closure over time. By 12 weeks of treatment, 56% (63 of 112 patients) of DFUs treated with Apligraf plus conventional therapy (debridement, saline dressings, total off-loading) were 100% closed, compared to 38% (36 of 96 subjects) of ulcers treated with conventional therapy alone (p=.0042). The median time to 100% wound closure was 65 days for DFUs treated with Apligraf plus conventional therapy versus 90 days for ulcers treated with conventional therapy alone (p=.0026). 
 Recurrence is an important measure of healing durability, and in the study, 96% of ulcers treated with Apligraf remained closed at six months versus 87% in the control group. An important outcome of the study was an observed reduction in the incidence of reported adverse events of osteomyelitis and amputations/resections. Patients receiving Apligraf had a statistically significant (p<.05) lower incidence of osteomyelitis at the study ulcer site (2.7% vs. 10.4%) compared to patients treated with conventional therapy at six months. Apligraf-treated patients required significantly fewer amputations or resections of the study limb (6.3% vs. 15.6%) (p <.05) compared to patients treated with conventional therapy at six months. The primary results of the study are presented in the figures below. 
 

Incidence of 100% Wound Closure | Median Time to 100% Wound Closure

Reduction in Osteomyelitis and Amputation / Resection 
 

For the VLU pivotal trial, the efficacy of Apligraf was evaluated in a prospective, parallel-group, randomized, controlled, multi-center study involving 240 patients with VLUs. Subjects receiving Apligraf in combination with compression therapy were compared with an active treatment concurrent control of zinc paste gauze and compression therapy. Apligraf plus compression therapy was more effective in achieving complete wound closure by week 24 (57% vs 40%, p=.022). In patients with long-standing VLUs with greater than one years duration (n=120), Apligraf plus compression therapy was more than twice as effective in achieving complete wound closure by week 24 (47% vs 19%, p=.002). The primary results of the study are presented in the figures below.

 All Patients Achieving 100% Closure 
 

Comparative Effectiveness and Economic Studies 
 We conducted three comparative effectiveness studies with Apligraf utilizing our proprietary access to data collected in Net Healths WoundExpert® Electronic Medical Record, or EMR, database. Net Healths wound care software is utilized by more than 1,000 wound care centers across the United States. In collaboration with statistical experts and leading clinicians, we analyzed outcomes of treatment with Apligraf versus other skin substitutes including EpiFix (owned by MiMedx), Theraskin (owned by Misonix, Inc.) and Oasis (owned by Smith & Nephew). All three studies showed that Apligraf improved overall healing rates as well as time to healing. For example, patients treated with Apligraf showed a 53% relative improvement in healing over patients treated with EpiFix at 24 weeks. All three studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. 
 The Analysis Group, a private economics consulting firm, conducted a study to evaluate the economic outcomes of Medicare patients receiving Apligraf and Dermagraft, assessing the real-world medical services utilization and associated costs compared to patients receiving conventional care. Data for 502 matched Apligraf and conventional care patient pairs and 222 matched Dermagraft and conventional care patient pairs were analyzed. Increased costs associated with outpatient service utilization relative to matched conventional care patients were offset by lower amputation rates, fewer days hospitalized and fewer emergency department visits among Apligraf and Dermagraft patients. Consequently, Apligraf and Dermagraft patients with DFUs had per-patient average healthcare costs during the 18-month follow-up period that were lower than their respective matched conventional care counterparts (Apligraf was $5,253 (p=0.49), lower per patient, while Dermagraft was $6,991 (p=0.84) lower). These findings suggest that use of Apligraf and Dermagraft for treatment of DFU may lower overall medical costs through reduced utilization of costly healthcare services. 
Mechanism of Action Clinical Study 
 To elucidate the mechanisms through which Apligraf promotes healing of chronic VLUs, the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Department of Dermatology & Cutaneous Surgery conducted an RCT in which 24 patients with non-healing VLUs were treated with either standard of care (compression therapy) or Apligraf together with standard of care. Tissue biopsies were collected from the VLU edge before and one week after treatment, and the samples underwent comprehensive analysis of gene expression and protein analyses. The analyses conducted suggest that Apligraf induced a shift from a non-healing to a healing tissue response, involving modulation of inflammatory and growth factor signaling, keratinocyte activation, and attenuation of signaling involved in the chronic ulcer impaired state. In these ways, Apligraf application orchestrated a shift from the chronic non-healing ulcer microenvironment to a distinctive healing milieu resembling that of an acute, healing wound. 
 Dermagraft 
 Dermagraft was approved as a Class III medical device for the treatment of DFUs based on the results of a large pivotal clinical trial. Three hundred fourteen patients were enrolled in a prospective RCT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Dermagraft in conjunction with conventional therapy compared to a control arm of conventional therapy alone. Conventional therapy involved the sharp debridement and cleaning of the ulcer, application of a wet-to-dry gauze and the use of therapeutic, pressure-reducing footwear. Patients were eligible to be screened for the trial if they had a plantar DFU on the heel or forefoot that was greater than 1cm2 and less than 20cm2. At the screening visit, the patients began receiving conventional therapy. If the DFU had not decreased in size by more than 50% during the next two weeks and the patient met all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient was randomized into one of two treatment groups: Dermagraft plus conventional therapy or conventional therapy alone. Patients in the Dermagraft group received a weekly application of Dermagraft and conventional therapy for up to eight weeks. The primary endpoint for the trial was superiority in complete DFU closure by 12 weeks. 
 
17 


 Pivotal FDA Registration Trial 
 In the pivotal clinical trial, the weekly application of Dermagraft and conventional therapy for up to eight weeks increased the proportion of DFUs that achieved 100% closure at 12 weeks by 64%, when compared to the use of conventional therapy alone. Patients treated in the Dermagraft group were 1.7 times more likely to achieve 100% closure than patients receiving conventional therapy alone. These results demonstrated statistically significant improvements. The incidence of adverse events among the Dermagraft and control groups was generally consistent across both groups, with the most common adverse events being infection at the DFU site, infection not at the DFU site, accidental injury and skin dysfunction/blister. However, the percentage of patients who developed an infection at the DFU site was significantly lower in the Dermagraft treatment group as compared with the control group, 10.4% versus 17.9%, respectively. No adverse laboratory findings were associated with the use of Dermagraft and no adverse device effects were reported in the trial. In addition, no immunological responses or rejections from patients that received Dermagraft were reported in this trial or in patients treated to date. The primary healing data for the trial is presented in the figure below. 
Percent of Patients with Complete Healing by 12 Weeks 
 

In a post-hoc analysis, it was determined that in patients treated with Dermagraft there was a significant reduction in incidence of amputations or bone resections, as compared to the control group (12.6% versus 5.5%, respectively, p=0.031). No adverse laboratory findings were associated with the use of Dermagraft and no adverse device effects were reported in the trial. In addition, no immunological responses or rejections from patients that received Dermagraft were reported in this trial or in patients treated to date. The amputation or bone resection data is presented in the figure below.

Comparative Effectiveness and Economic Studies 
 We have conducted one comparative effectiveness study with Dermagraft, which utilizes our proprietary access to data collected in the EMR database. This study, which was published in a peer-reviewed journal, compared Dermagraft outcomes to EpiFix (owned by MiMedx), and showed a 52% relative improvement in healing over EpiFix by week 24. 
 The economic study of Dermagraft in a Medicare population conducted by the Analysis Group is described under the heading Our Products Previously Published Clinical Studies for FDA-Approved ProductsApligrafComparative Effectiveness and Economic Studies above.

 Product Pipeline 
 We have a robust pipeline of products under development for both the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets. We believe our pipeline efforts will deepen our comprehensive portfolio of offerings as well as allow us to address additional clinical applications. The following table summarizes our pipeline products and potential timeline for their commercial launch: 
 

PuraPly XT 
 PuraPly XT is a version of PuraPly AM with enhanced thickness and PHMB content that allows for sustained presence of the antimicrobial barrier in the wound. Like PuraPly AM, PuraPly XT is intended for 510(k) indications for the treatment of chronic and acute wounds (other than 3rd degree burns) and the surgical treatment of open wounds. We commercially launched this product in 2020. 
 PuraForce 
 PuraForce is a bioengineered porcine collagen surgical matrix for use in soft tissue reinforcement applications that is intended for 510(k) indications for the reinforcement of all tendons in the body. PuraForce has high biomechanical strength per unit thickness, making it ideal for extremities applications. We commercially launched this product in 2019. 
 PuraPly MZ 
 PuraPly MZ is a micronized particulate version of PuraPly that allows application in powder or gel form to deep and tunneling wounds. Like PuraPly, PuraPly MZ is intended for indications for the management of chronic and acute wounds (other than 3rd degree burns) and in conjunction with the surgical treatment of open wounds. A 510k application has been filed, and FDA has requested additional preclinical biocompatibility testing which is ongoing. Following successful 510k Clearance, we plan to commercially launch this product in late 2021 or early 2022.

 Novachor 
 Novachor is a fresh chorionic membrane wound covering in which native tissue elements are preserved, including viable cells, growth factors/cytokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The product is regulated as a 361 HCT/P when promoted and utilized clinically for homologous use as a wound covering or surgical barrier. We expect to commercially launch this product in 2021 or early 2022, following technology transfer of production to our contract manufacturer. 
 TransCyte 
 TransCyte is a bioengineered tissue scaffold that promotes burn healing, and has received PMA approval for the treatment of deep second- and third-degree burns. We acquired the product from Shire, and it was previously marketed by Smith & Nephew. TransCyte complements our portfolio to address all severities of burn wounds. TransCyte is a flexible, durable product that provides bioactive dermal components, an outer protective barrier, increased re-epithelialization and pain relief for patients suffering from burns. We believe TransCyte will address a sizable market opportunity with limited competition, with only one other PMA approved product that would be directly competitive to TransCyte currently on the market. We plan to initiate a market re-introduction program in late 2021, and will target a full commercial launch in late 2023. We also plan to launch in the same timeframe a complementary biosynthetic wound product, a Class II Medical Device for the management of burns, for which we plan to seek 510(k) clearance in the second half of 2021. 
 Gintuit 
 Gintuit is a surgically applied bioengineered bi-layered living cellular tissue that supports the healing of oral soft tissue. It is currently the only BLA approved product based on cultured allograft cells and it is indicated for the treatment of mucogingival conditions in adults. We are not currently marketing Gintuit.

 We offer our customers in-house customer support services, including services provided by our experienced reimbursement support team, our medical and technical support team and our field-based medical science liaison team. We believe that we have a competitive advantage by providing these essential support services in-house in that we are able to align the support services closely with our sales efforts as appropriate and improve the customers overall experience. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development team has extensive experience in developing regenerative medicine products, and works to design products that are intended to improve patient outcomes, simplify techniques, shorten procedures, reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and, as a result, reduce costs. We conduct research and development activities at our laboratory facilities in Canton, MA, Birmingham, AL and La Jolla, CA. We have recruited and retained staff with significant experience and skills, gained through both industry experience and training at leading colleges and universities with regenerative medicine graduate programs. In addition to our internal staff, our external network of development labs, testing labs and physicians aid us in our research and development process. 
 The majority of our product portfolio, including Apligraf, our PuraPly product family, Gintuit, our collagen biomaterial technology platform product family and all of our amniotic products, were developed by our legacy and NuTech Medical research and development team. We have proven competencies to bring products to market via a broad range of regulatory classifications, as evidenced by FDA approval or clearance of our products via PMA approval of a Class III medical device; BLA approval of a biologics product; and 510(k) clearance of a Class II medical device, in addition to our 361 HCT/P allograft products and several products for which we have obtained international registrations. 
 Manufacturing and Suppliers 
 We manufacture internally our primary non-amniotic products and use third-party manufacturers for our amniotic products. We have significant expansion capabilities in our in-house manufacturing facilities and we believe that our contract manufacturers are well positioned to support future expansion. 
 We have robust internal compliance processes to maintain the high quality and reliability of our products. We use annual internal audits, combined with external audits by regulatory agencies to monitor our quality control practices. We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturing establishment and a HCT/P registered establishment. We are also accredited by the AATB and licensed with several states per their tissue banks regulations. All of our contract manufacturers are registered with the FDA as HCT/P establishments and are AATB accredited. 
 We utilize third-party raw material suppliers to support our internal manufacturing processes. We select all of our suppliers through a rigorous process to ensure high quality and reliability with the capacity to support our expanding production levels. Only raw material from approved suppliers is used in the manufacture of our products. To confirm quality and identify any risks, our approved suppliers are audited at pre-determined intervals. Historically, we have not experienced any significant difficulty locating and obtaining the suppliers or materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements. In the first quarter of 2019, however, we suspended production of our product Affinity due to production issues at one of our suppliers. As this was our sole supplier of Affinity, it resulted in a disruption of our production capabilities. We identified an alternate supplier and were able to resume commercial-scale production in the second quarter of 2020.

 Manufacture of our products is dependent on the availability of sufficient quantities of source tissue, which is the primary component of our products. Source tissue includes donated human tissue, porcine tissue and bovine tissue. We acquire donated human tissue directly through institutional review board approved protocols at multiple hospitals, as well as through tissue procurement firms engaged by us or by our contract manufacturers. We have two qualified porcine tissue suppliers, and currently one source of bovine tissue. Our processing of these tissues is, and our supplier sources are required to be, compliant with applicable FDA current Good Tissue Practice, or cGTP, regulations, AATB standards and U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, requirements. 
 Reimbursement 
 Overview 
 Our customers primarily consist of hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ASCs and physician offices, all of whom rely on coverage and reimbursement for our products by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers. Governmental insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, typically have published and defined coverage criteria and published reimbursement rates for medical products, services and procedures that are established by law or regulation. Non-government payers have their own coverage criteria and often negotiate payment rates for medical products, services and procedures. Many also require prior authorization as a prerequisite to coverage. In addition, in the United States, an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and also may require prior authorization for the products and services that a member receives. Coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial payers is not assured and is subject to change. 
 Medicare, the federally funded program that provides healthcare coverage for senior citizens and the disabled, is the largest third-party payer in the United States. CMS, administers the Medicare program and uses MACs to process claims, develop coverage policies and make payments within designated geographic jurisdictions. Our products fall under the jurisdiction of the Part A/B MACs. Medicare coverage for our products is established by each MAC for its specific jurisdiction. CMS does not have a national coverage determination related to skin substitutes. Currently, all the MACs cover our products in the outpatient hospital, physician office and ASC settings. 
 Private payers often, but not always, follow the lead of Medicare or other governmental payers in making coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable Medicare coverage and reimbursement can sometimes be a significant factor in obtaining favorable coverage and reimbursement for products by private payers. While most private payers currently cover Apligraf and Dermagraft, most of those payers do not cover many of our other products, such as PuraPly, PuraPly AM, NuShield, and Affinity. 
 Currently, Medicare makes a separate payment for our products when used in the physician office at a payment rate of average sales price (ASP) plus 6%. Legislation was recently enacted that temporarily discontinued the sequestration rate of 2% of the government portion which resulted in a final payment rate of ASP+4.3%. The sequestration will begin again on April 1, 2021. In the outpatient hospital and ASC settings, Medicare payment for all our products is bundled into the payment for the application procedure. 
 All skin substitute products administered in the hospital outpatient department and ASC settings are bundled, except for those products that have been approved by CMS for pass-through status. Pursuant to the Appropriations Act, PuraPly AM and PuraPly had pass-through status from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020 at which time the pass-through status expired. As of October 1, 2020, payment for PuraPly and PuraPly AM is bundled into the payment rate for the application procedure. The amount of the pass-through payment for PuraPly AM and PuraPly was equal to ASP + 6% for the applicable calendar quarter. 
 Skin Substitutes Used for Wound Care 
 All of our Advanced Wound Care products are classified as skin substitutes for Medicare reimbursement purposes. In 2014, CMS instituted bundled payments in the hospital outpatient and ASC setting for skin substitutes using a two-tier payment system. The Medicare payment system bundles payment for our products (and all skin substitutes) into the payment for the application of the skin substitute, resulting in a single payment to the provider that includes both the application of the product and the product itself. There is one bundled payment amount for procedures that involve high cost products, i.e., products whose cost exceeds a threshold amount, and another bundled payment amount for procedures that involve low cost products that do not meet the threshold. The bundled payment rate is updated annually and is also geographically adjusted. Currently, all of our wound care products are assigned to the high cost bundle; it is not possible to predict, however, whether those products will continue to be assigned to the high cost bundle or the rates that will be paid for each bundle. Further, under the bundling policy there is an inherent incentive to use the cheapest products available, even if those products are less effective. 
 
23 


 The bundled payment rates are also geographically adjusted. This geographic adjustment may result in significant payment variations among regions; for example, sixty percent of the hospital payment rate is adjusted to take into account the regions wage-index, which can vary widely from one region to another. The wage-index adjustment may result in reimbursement being insufficient to account for the cost of skin substitute products and sizes in one geographic area that are fully reimbursed in other geographic areas. 
 All skin substitute products administered in the hospital outpatient department and ASC settings are bundled, except for those products that have been approved by CMS for pass-through status. In order to encourage the development of innovative medical devices, drugs and biologics, Congress created pass-through payments to allow payment for new innovative medical products to be added to the current Medicare rate. For a limited period of time, products with pass-through status are reimbursed through an additional reimbursement amount known as a pass through payment, for the medical device, drug or biologic on top of the bundled payment amount the hospital would receive for performing the service. The additional payment amount is the hospitals charge for the pass-through product reduced to cost using the hospitals specific cost to charge ratio, less an offset for the amount of money already included in the bundle for skin substitute products. 
 PuraPly AM and PuraPly were included in the bundled payment structure from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018. Section 1301 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which was enacted on March 23, 2018, restored the pass-through status of PuraPly AM and PuraPly effective October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020. Beginning on October 1, 2018, Medicare resumed making pass-through payments when PuraPly AM and PuraPly were used in outpatient hospital and ASC settings. All other skin substitute products, including all of our other products, remained in the bundled payment structure. The amount of the pass-through payment for PuraPly AM and PuraPly was equal to ASP + 6% for the applicable calendar quarter. The Consolidated Appropriations Act applied only to Medicare, and does not apply to Medicaid or any commercial payers. As noted above, as of October 1, 2020, payment for PuraPly and PuraPly AM is once again bundled into the payment rate for the application procedure. 
 Furthermore, Medicare has signaled that it may revise its two-tiered bundled payment policy for skin substitutes. Medicare solicited comments in calendar year 2019 proposed rule related to proposed updates and policy changes under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Payment System. Medicare specifically solicited comments on whether it should eliminate the two-tiered bundle policy and establish a single bundle for all products. It is possible that Medicare will revise its payment policy in calendar year 2022 or calendar year 2023. Any revised policy could result in decreased reimbursement for our products which could decrease utilization and reduce our revenues. Moreover, any new policy could result in a financial incentive for hospitals and ASCs to use our competitors products, thereby reducing our market share and revenue. 
 In the physician office setting, payment for skin substitutes is not bundled into the payment for the administration of the product. Skin substitutes are paid separately from the application procedure and the Medicare payment rate for all skin substitutes (including ours) is calculated based on the manufacturers ASP on a per square centimeter basis with the total payment for the product being the per square centimeter ASP-based payment rate multiplied by the total number of centimeters. In the physician office setting the Medicare payment rates for all skin substitutes (including ours) are updated quarterly based on manufacturer reported ASP and are not geographically adjusted. The actual payment rate for skin substitutes is ASP plus 6%, which will be adjusted for the statutorily mandated sequestration starting on April 1, 2021 resulting in an actual payment of ASP plus 4.3%. This payment methodology applies only to physician offices. Medicare does not require us to report ASP for our products because they are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. However, starting in January 2022, we will be required to report ASP for all our products because of a provision enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, signed into law on December 27, 2020. Currently, the local Part A/B MACs establish local payment for drugs and biologics whose ASP does not appear in the quarterly ASP file. MACs have discretion to pay for such products based on invoices submitted by providers, Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) + 6%, or they may contact CMS to determine if there is unpublished ASP data. 
 Commercial insurers contract with participating providers such as hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ASCs and physician offices to establish agreed upon payment rates for items and services, including skin substitutes. Usually, these rates are in the form of a fee-schedule but sometimes there is a bundled payment rate. In many cases, the fee schedules are based on Medicare payment rates, which are bundled in hospitals and ASCs, but not in physician offices. These rates may vary by insurer, provider and by region. 
 Medicaid coverage and payment rates and policies as to the types of providers (e.g., podiatrists) who are allowed to apply our products are determined by each states Medicaid program. Some states may bundle Medicaid payment for skin substitutes into the payment for the application procedure, like Medicare, while other states may pay separately. State Medicaid programs may reach different conclusions regarding the medical necessity of products used in treating Medicaid patients. 
 Surgical & Sports Medicine Products 
 Surgical & Sports Medicine products administered on an inpatient basis in a hospital are reimbursed by Medicare as part of a bundled payment based on the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group, or MS-DRG, to which a patient is assigned upon discharge from the hospital. MS-DRG assignment is determined according to the patients primary diagnosis, but can also be affected by other diagnoses that affect the patients condition and the provision of certain surgical procedures. In addition, certain MS-DRGs account for complications and comorbidities, which may increase the reimbursement amount. 
 
24 


 The MS-DRG payment rate is a consolidated prospective payment for all services provided by the hospital during the patients hospitalization, based on the average cost of care calculated from Medicare claims data. With extremely few exceptions, the MS-DRG payment is inclusive of all services, products, and resources. Products administered during surgical procedures are not typically coded or paid separately when provided to a hospital inpatient. MS-DRG payments are case rates and hospitals profit when their costs for a particular patient are below the case-rate and they are at risk of a loss if their costs are above the case rate. 
 Some private payers use the MS-DRG based system to reimburse facilities for inpatient services. 
 Competition 
 We operate in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid technological change. Success in these markets depends primarily on product efficacy, ease of product use, product price, availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement, customer support services for technical, clinical and reimbursement support, and customer preference for, and loyalty to, the products. 
 We believe that the demonstrated clinical efficacy of our products, the breadth of our product portfolio, our in-house customer support services, our customer relationships and reputation offer us advantages over our competitors. In addition, we believe we are the only regenerative medicine company offering PMA approved and 510(k) cleared products in addition to our 361 HCT/Ps. 
 Our products compete primarily with skin substitute products, amniotic technology products, orthobiologics products, other advanced wound care and traditional wound care products, among others. Our competitors include 3M, Incorporated, Amniox Medical, Inc., Arthrex, Inc., Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, Medtronic plc, MiMedx Group, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Misonix, Inc. and Stryker Corporation. 
 We also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as to acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. 
 We are aware of several companies that compete, or are developing technologies, in our current and future product areas. As a result, we expect competition to remain intense. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, are cost effective and are safe and effective. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property and operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, patents, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Other than a license from Novartis Pharma AG for trademark and domain name rights to Apligraf and an exclusive license from RESORBA Medical GmbH, or Resorba, to a U.S. patent for a collagen-based wound dressing containing PHMB, we do not have any additional material licenses to any technology or intellectual property rights. Under the terms of the exclusive license from Resorba, we were obligated to make minimum royalty payments of $1.0 million in each of 2018 and 2019, and were subject to a $2.5 million minimum royalty payment in 2017, as part of an ongoing low single digit royalty payment on net sales of PuraPly AM; the term of the license shall continue for the life of the patent, which expires in October 2026. We may also terminate the license upon written notice to Resorba in the event that (i) the patent is invalidated or (ii) we stop all activities that would require a license to the patent, and either party may terminate the license in the event of a material breach by the other party, subject to notice and an ability to cure. In addition, we were obligated to make upfront and maintenance payments totaling $0.6 million at specified periods prior to April 1, 2019, including a payment of $0.2 million that was made on July 1, 2018. The license is assignable but not sub-licensable.
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 28 issued patents globally, of which 12 were U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 10 pending patent applications, of which 6 were patent applications pending in the United States. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, many of our issued patents are currently expected to expire between 2021 and 2036. The expiration of these patents is not expected to have a material impact on our business. In addition, many of our products, including our Apligraf, Dermagraft and NuShield products, are not covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications. Our issued patents are drawn to the following main areas: methods of making and using cultured tissue constructs, containers for shipping frozen products, bioreactor culture dish systems having an accessible sealing port, methods for preparing multi-layer stacks of living tissue, cultured three-dimensional tissues comprising a scaffold of a biocompatible non-living material, methods for treating recessed

  oral gingiva using cultured tissue constructs, methods of making and using osteogenic implants comprising a placental membrane sheet, wound treatment methods using amniotic stem cell solutions and placental membrane sheets, methods of generating cartilage in a skeletal joint using placental membrane preparations, hepatocyte growth factor- and hyaluronic acid-containing compositions and methods of using such compositions, methods making placental membrane preparations comprising hyaluronic acid, methods of harvesting or proliferating human prenatal stem cells, hypothermic morselized placental membrane storage methods, and adjustable debridement curette apparatuses. Our pending patent applications encompass additional areas, including wound treating methods using morselized amnion tissue and amniotic-derived cells, methods of assessing native stem cell populations using cultured isolated stem cells and reference cell sources, visco-supplement compositions and musculoskeletal inflammatory treatment methods using same, uses of human amniotic fluid for treating chronic wounds and joint diseases. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and we can give no assurance that any patents that have issued or might issue in the future will protect our current or future products or provide us with any competitive advantage. See the section titled Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property for additional information. 
 Additionally, we own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that are used in our business and in conjunction with the sale of our products, including 11 U.S. trademark registrations and 6 foreign trademark registrations, as of December 31, 2020. 
 We also seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Regulation of Product Registration, Manufacture and Promotion 
 We market medical products in the United States that have either been approved or cleared by the FDA prior to marketing, or do not require FDA premarket review. Our marketed products that have received marketing authorization from the FDA have done so under one of the following agency pathways: 510(k) clearance for a Class II medical device; approval of a PMA for a Class III medical device; or approval of a BLA for a biological product. These medical products are regulated by the FDA under the PHSA or the FDCA along with the FDAs implementing regulations. These federal statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the following activities that we perform or are performed on our behalf and will continue to perform or have performed on our behalf: the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, labeling, storage, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution of our products into interstate commerce, record keeping, service and surveillance, complaint handling, repair or recall of products, adverse event reporting and other field safety corrective actions. 
FDA Regulatory Review and Approval Process 
 Unless an exemption applies or the product is a Class I device, each medical device that we market must first receive either 510(k) clearance or PMA approval from the FDA. In addition, certain modifications made to marketed devices also may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. We maintain necessary clearances and approvals for products derived from porcine, bovine, and human tissues that are regulated by the FDA. PuraPly, PuraPly AM, PuraPly XT, and PuraForce are medical devices that have been cleared for marketing under a number of 510(k)s for uses such as wound dressing, intraoral barrier, and surgical mesh. We also maintain medical device approvals for the Apligraf (P950032) and Dermagraft (P000036) devices, both approved by the FDA as chronic wound treatments. 
 
26 


 With respect to the manufacture of medical devices and biologics, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. After receiving approval from the FDA, additional regulatory review or inspection may be required if we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process. Our manufacturing processes must comply with the FDAs Quality System Regulation, or QSR, for our medical device products. The QSR requires that each device manufacturer establish and implement a quality system under which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturers written specifications and procedures relating to the devices. Among other things, these regulations require that manufacturers establish performance requirements before production and follow requirements applicable to design controls, testing, record keeping, documentation, manufacturing standards, labeling, complaint handling, and management review. 
 Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 The FDA conducts periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, to re-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are severe and urgent, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a 483 or warning letter, the FDA may take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences, which may include: 
 

 | cease and desist orders;
--+-------------------------


 | injunctions, or consent decrees;
--+---------------------------------


 | civil monetary penalties;
--+--------------------------


 | recall, detention or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | operating restrictions, partial or total shutdown of production facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of or delay in granting our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA or BLA approval of new products or modified products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA/BLA approvals that are already granted;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal to grant export approval or export certificates for our products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 In addition, we must comply with medical device reporting regulations and corrections and removal reporting regulations. Medical device reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Corrections and removal reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA may also order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. 
 
27 


 Certain human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, are regulated under Section 361 of the PHSA and are referred to as Section 361 HCT/Ps or simply 361 HCT/Ps, while other HCT/Ps are subject to the FDAs regulatory requirements for medical devices and/or biologics. A product that is regulated as a 361 HCT/P may be commercially distributed without prior FDA clearance or approval. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1271.10, in order to be regulated as a 361 HCT/P, and hence exempt from premarket review, an HCT/P must be minimally manipulated, intended for homologous use, and manufactured without being combined with another article (except for water, crystalloids, or sterilizing, preserving, or storage agents). The HCT/P must also either have no systemic effect and not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function or, if it has a systemic effect, be intended for autologous use, for allogeneic use in a first-degree or second-degree blood relative or for reproductive use. We believe that Affinity and NuShield generally fulfill the relevant criteria under 21 CFR 1271.10. In light of the 361 HCT/P Guidance, our labeling and marketing claims for Affinity and NuShield clarify that they are intended for use as wound coverings, and thus qualify as Section 361 HCT/Ps. However, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion and require premarket approval or clearance for Affinity, NuShield or any amniotic or chorion-based sheet product we presently or may in the future market, which would disrupt the marketing of these products, potentially expose us to regulatory sanctions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Section 361 HCT/Ps are subject to specific FDA regulations that include cGTPs, donor eligibility determination requirements, adverse event reporting, and advertising and labeling requirements. cGTP regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including but not limited to all steps in recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution. 
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, potency, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and certain amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDAs regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the trial protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, be combined, or be bifurcated into two parts: 
 

 | Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
28 


 
 | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. In January 2021, we announced that the first patient was enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Sometimes approval for a product is conditional upon the completion of post-marketing clinical studies. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the IRB, and the investigators for: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; any findings from other trials; findings from animal or in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but no later than seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. 
 The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, regenerative medicine advance therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. 
 

 | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review.

 | Regenerative Medicine Advance Therapy (RMAT) designation. RMAT was introduced as a new designation under the 21st Century Cures Act for the development and review of certain regenerative medicine therapies. As set forth in section 506(g)(8) of the FDCA, the term regenerative medicine therapy is defined to include cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the PHSA. To receive RMAT designation, a regenerative medicine product candidate must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical need. RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies, as breakthrough designation requires. Similar to breakthrough designation, an RMAT product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review. Regenerative medicine therapies that qualify for RMAT designation may also qualify for other FDA expedited programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation, if they meet the criteria for such programs. In January 2021, we announced ReNu received the RMAT designation from the FDA for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

 | Accelerated approval. Drugs or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, for accelerated approval products FDA typically requires pre- dissemination submission of promotional materials to FDA for the agencys consideration. A drug approved under the accelerated approval pathway may have its approval revoked on several grounds including if a required post-approval trial fails to verify clinical benefit or does not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug.

 Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval Requirements 
 FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties. 
Medical Product Marketing and Promotion 
 Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices and biologics are also subject to FDA oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDAs implementing regulations. The FDAs oversight authority review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. A sponsor also must comply with the FDAs advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the products approved labeling (known as off-label use). The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement actions may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. 
Government Advocacy 
 We engage in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continue to work to demonstrate that our therapeutic products provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. We advocate with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target FDA-regulated medical devices and biologics as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, we encourage those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens access to appropriate health care. 
 Regulations Governing Reimbursement/Fraud and Abuse 
 Within the United States, our products and our customers are subject to extensive regulation by a wide range of federal and state agencies. These agencies regulate the coverage and reimbursement of our products, including prohibiting activities that might result in fraud and abuse. Internationally, other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.

 U.S. federal health care fraud and abuse laws generally apply to our activities because our products are covered under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The principal U.S. federal health care fraud and abuse laws applicable to us and our activities include: (1) the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value in order to generate business reimbursable by a federal health care program; (2) the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program, including claims resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; and (3) health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer. 
 The Anti-Kickback Statute is particularly relevant because of its broad applicability. Specifically, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Almost any financial interaction with a healthcare provider, patient or customer will implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect certain interactions if specific requirements are met. However, only those interactions that represent fair market value exchanges generally are protected by a safe harbor or exception. The government can exercise enforcement discretion in taking action against unprotected activities. Many types of interactions in which we commonly engage, such as customer support services, could implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute, are not protected by a safe harbor or exception and have been the subject of government scrutiny and enforcement action when not structured appropriately. If the government determines that these activities are abusive, we could be subject to enforcement action. Other companies that manufacture wound care products have been subject to government scrutiny and enforcement action. For example, in early 2017, Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC and other subsidiaries of Shire plc agreed to pay $350 million to settle federal and state False Claims Act allegations that Shire and the company that Shire acquired in 2011, Advanced BioHealing, employed kickbacks and other unlawful methods to induce clinics and physicians to use or overuse its product Dermagraft (a product we subsequently acquired). Penalties for Anti-Kickback Statute violations may include both criminal penalties such as imprisonment and civil sanctions such as fines and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. Exclusion would mean that our products would no longer be eligible for reimbursement under federal healthcare programs. 
 There are similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs as well as to commercial third-party payers. Insurance companies may also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. In addition, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, may be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the United States if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the laws of that country. 
 In addition to receiving scrutiny and providing potential grounds for action under the Anti-Kickback Statute, pricing, sales and marketing practices of medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers are also subject to tightly focused regulation at the federal and state levels. Federal law and regulation, for example, establishes pricing methodologies for government health insurance programs and requires regular reporting of sales information to CMS in support of manufacturer price calculations. In recent years, the federal government and a growing number of states have introduced new drug price transparency requirements that can require extensive information disclosures to agencies or potential purchasers relating to drug price increases. Health care laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with voluntary compliance standards issued by industry associations and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called sunshine laws). Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Manufacturers must adopt reasonable interpretations of requirements if there is ambiguity and those interpretations could be challenged. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. 
 The healthcare laws and regulations applicable to us, including those described above, are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows. To help ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing the provision of health care goods and services, we have implemented a comprehensive compliance program based on the HHS Office of Inspector Generals Seven Elements of an Effective Compliance Program. Despite our compliance program, we cannot be certain that we have always operated in full compliance with all applicable healthcare laws.

 Our profitability and operations are subject to risks relating to changes in legislative, regulatory, and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them. 
 Seasonality 
 Revenues during our fourth quarter tend to be stronger than other quarters because many hospitals increase their purchases of our products during the fourth quarter to coincide with the end of their budget cycles in the United States. Satisfaction of patient deductibles through the course of the year also results in increased revenues later in the year. In general, our first quarter usually has lower revenues than the preceding fourth quarter, the second and third quarters have higher revenues than the first quarter, and the fourth quarter revenues are the highest in the year. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 910 employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.
