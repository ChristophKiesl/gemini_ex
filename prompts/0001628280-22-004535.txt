Item 1. Business
Overview
We have pioneered a new category of software, experience management, or XM, that enables organizations to succeed in today’s experience economy. Our XM Platform helps organizations both design and improve the experiences that turn their customers into fanatics, employees into ambassadors, products into obsessions, and brands into religions. 
Why It Matters:
The experiences organizations deliver are vital to their ability to compete and win. The cost of switching products or services has become so low that 85% of consumers are likely to switch brands due to a single poor experience. The global pandemic, which has altered the way people work, shop, and interact with each other, accelerated a shift in nearly every expectation people have of businesses. 
Experience management is the business discipline of helping organizations connect with their customers and employees. Experience management is growing because businesses are facing unprecedented fluidity and risk. By working with Qualtrics, companies have the opportunity to get things right to attract great talent, develop loyalty among their customers and build lasting, meaningful businesses and brands. 
The Qualtrics XM Platform is a mission-critical software platform that enables breakthrough design and continuous improvement of customer, employee, product, and brand experiences — the four core experiences of every organization. Qualtrics allows all four experiences to be managed on a single, connected platform:
•CustomerXM –– decrease churn, increase engagement, and expand customer lifetime value, or LTV, by listening to customers across all channels and taking action on their feedback.
•EmployeeXM –– drive retention, increase engagement, and improve productivity by continuously listening to employees and delivering better workplace experiences.
•ProductXM –– design products people love, decrease time to market, and increase share of wallet by uncovering and acting on user needs, desires, and expectations.
•BrandXM –– create a bedrock of loyal followers, acquire new customers, and increase market share by ensuring that your brand resonates at each critical touchpoint and attracts target buyers. 
Unlike most “experience” offerings on the market, Qualtrics does more than use surveys to collect post-transaction feedback to monitor trends in satisfaction scores. Instead, our XM Operating System is a single, secure, cloud-native platform that enables organizations to bring together all of their experience data, both structured and unstructured, analyze it with native advanced AI-powered analytics, and take real-time action to continually improve the experiences they deliver across customer, employee, product, and brand.
With the acquisition of Clarabridge in 2021, Qualtrics strengthened its ability to help organizations discover everything their customers and employees are saying, wherever they are saying it, including social media, emails, support calls, chats and product reviews. In bringing together Clarabridge and Qualtrics, Qualtrics is now a leading platform for listening, understanding and taking action on both structured and unstructured data. This combination is critical for keeping up with the influx of unstructured experience data coming into an organization. This allows organizations to design products, services and experiences that customers and employees want next by acting on feedback from anywhere. 
Qualtrics is a system of action that guides users with specific instructions for improvement and automated actions to improve experiences. It provides each individual employee in an organization a powerful, easy-to-use interface that creates everyday habits to take action on feedback from customers and employees. It has the power to change organizational behavior and create a culture of action. 
The Qualtrics XM Platform 
Qualtrics XM Operating System (XM/OS) is a platform that helps organizations design the next set of experiences that attract new customers and employees, and then continuously improve each of those experiences to stay relevant, retain customers and employees, and become even more competitive across the four core experiences of business — employee, customer, brand, and product. 
At the core of XM/OS are three powerful interconnected services — ExperienceID, iQ, and xFlow — that power all our applications, products and use cases and are backed by enterprise-grade security, compliance, and governance trusted by over 16,750 companies and 89% of the Fortune 100.
Listen - Experience ID: Listen to every customer, and remember what they need 
Experience ID offers a single, unified view of everything customers and employees have shared with a company — things they want a company to know about them — including their preferences, beliefs and feelings about their experiences with their product or brand. Experience ID enables companies to personalize experiences at scale — giving them granular insights about individuals, while also delivering powerful aggregated views by segment, such as teams, geographies, verticals and more, to identify emerging trends and new market opportunities. 
Analyze - iQ: Understand what’s happening, why it’s happening, and take action
Our powerful analytics suite, Qualtrics iQ, analyzes each piece of feedback collected using deep statistical analysis and machine learning, then generates recommended actions, allowing teams to focus on the changes that drive the highest return on investment. Using a simple interface, alerts can be configured for the most important actions. These alerts could be a manager alert about a shift in employee morale, a change in a product bundle recommendation, or even a shipping process overhaul. 
As a market leader in listening to and collecting data, we assist our customers in collecting experience data from many channels. Text iQ, our advanced AI and natural language processing tool, helps organizations understand customer sentiment and emotion from open text. Text iQ is designed to be the most accurate and intuitive sentiment analysis solution in the industry, with more than 50 out-of-the box topic libraries across 25 industries so that companies can listen to the right signals and take action at scale.
Qualtrics has advanced natural language processing, or NLP, in 23 languages and over 150 categorization models to measure sentiment (the positivity or negative of comments), effort (the ease or difficulty expressed within feedback), emotions, empathy, intent, and more.
Act - xFlow: Build a culture of action 
With Experience Workflows, or xFlow, the Qualtrics XM Platform can automatically route recommended actions to the people in the best position to close experience gaps or close the loop with customers or employees automatically using experience workflow automation. Employees can log into a role-based account and receive alerts relevant to their role and be given specific actions to drive improvement. The system tracks issues, progress, and next steps to help monitor progress and keep managers informed.
XM/OS is uniquely positioned to solve the key challenges companies are struggling with around the world today. 
With Qualtrics, teams are empowered with the ability to build and save experience workflows that can be shared and scaled across departments, retail locations, or global deployments. Built with an open API architecture, our highly configurable platform provides a robust ecosystem of integrations for automating and connecting the entire experience management process –– from collecting experience feedback from any third-party channel, to uncovering hidden trends using native or third-party analysis, to driving activities and action using any operational system that employees already use as part of their existing routines. These automated solutions are available out of the box, purpose-built for specific industries, departments and geographies.
As of December 31, 2021, the Qualtrics XM Platform is trusted by more than 16,750 customers of all sizes, including 89% of the Fortune 100. The broad adoption of our platform is facilitated by a multi-pronged go-to-market model comprised of highly productive inside and field sales teams, joint solution selling with SAP, and our growing Qualtrics Partner Network (“QPN”) of over 300 global member companies that are partnering with us on our platform to help drive breakthrough business outcomes for our customers. 
What Sets Us Apart
Our approach to architecting solutions and how we bring those solutions to our customers has enabled us to strengthen our lead in the experience management category. We pioneered the experience management category nearly two decades ago and remain a recognized market leader in the category today. We are the leading and largest pure-play XM provider in the market. Our brand is synonymous with experience management and associated with quality and usability, providing us an advantage with attracting new customers. We are also thought leaders in the market. Through our founding of the XM Institute, we deliver a wide variety of industry-specific content, leadership, training, networking, and research to help experience management leaders develop and excel in their jobs.
We have several distinguishing advantages:
•Single Platform. Qualtrics allows all four experiences to be managed on a single, connected platform. Organizations power experience management programs across their customer, employee, product, and brand, monitor the health of their entire business through robust analytics and dashboards, and drive action across the entire organization from one common interface.
•Ability to Address Experience Holistically. We provide specific solutions across the key areas that have the highest impact on an organization: customers, employees, product, and brand. Our XM Platform analyzes experiences within each of these areas individually and correlates data across areas to provide insight into how they impact each other. Our XM Platform integrates X-data that we collect with siloed O-data that organizations already have, providing everyone in an organization from the C-suite to employees on the front line with a holistic view of experiences across key areas and constituencies. 
•Integrated Analytical Capabilities. Our platform is powered by a proprietary analytics engine that organizations of all types use to address some of the most demanding research projects. Our XM Platform leverages the latest in artificial intelligence and natural language processing to allow users to discover correlations between events, develop predictive models without using third-party tools, identify at-risk customers and employees, and suggest actions to course correct and drive impact. These capabilities are incorporated into our XM Platform through Qualtrics iQ, enabling advanced analytical features to make statistical analysis and insights available to everyone. Our analytical capabilities are tightly integrated with our XM Platform helping drive the instructions for improvement and automated actions within our system of action. 
•Built for Action. Qualtrics xFlow enables organizations to automate experience workflows to drive action natively or by integrating with systems that an organization already uses. For example, with our analytics-driven Smart Routing, our platform can automatically generate a customer ticket and action to resolution when a negative sentiment is expressed on a social media site. In this way, our XM Platform not only helps to identify issues, but also serves as a system of action by automatically directing feedback and recommended actions to the teams that are in the best position to make improvements. Or the system can bypass the need for employees to resolve issues and instead automate service recovery so customer or employee issues do not slip through the cracks. xFlow works across our platform and provides automatic notifications, raises tickets and closes experience gaps immediately. 
•Comprehensive Data Collection. Our XM Platform enables organizations to personalize their communication with customers, employees, and partners and interact with these groups through the most effective channels. We enable customers to collect data through both active and passive ingestion from a wide variety of channels, including SMS, e-mail, voice, web, in-app, social, chat and operational systems. Through simple integrations, users can incorporate operational data into XM analysis using native or a variety of other formats. Our comprehensive data collection methods allow customers to understand the 
sentiment of their end users across every engagement point so they can tailor relevant and personalized actions for any situation. 
•Real-time Insight. Our XM Platform is able to extract real-time feedback and provide insights and analysis when and to whom it matters most. This timeliness is necessary to affect outcomes, including reducing churn, increasing sales, preventing employee turnover, increasing engagement, and enhancing brand among others. 
•Flexible Configuration to Meet Specific Needs. Our customers have configured our platform to meet diverse needs from preparing PhD dissertations to ensuring successful product launches. Our XM Platform provides all of the tools necessary to enable program design configured to specific needs. Through an intuitive and elegant interface, users can design programs that implement complex logic and advanced workflows. Users can also design, deploy, and alter these programs without help from professional services or IT, leading to faster and more impactful insights. Our XM Platform can deliver these insights through flexible and scalable role-based dashboards to ensure people within an organization can access insight in real time and on any device.
•Democratization of Experience Management Across All Users. We designed our platform so every knowledge worker can make decisions and take actions based on customer and employee input. Users can design a customer and employee feedback program in minutes using simple drag and drop functions with the platform generating easy-to-consume analysis. This ease of use democratizes the ability for employees throughout an organization to extract business insights from sophisticated research and analysis. This allows every employee in the organization the ability to participate in finding and closing experience gaps for their respective areas of ownership.
•Enterprise Ready. Our XM Platform is scalable and secure. We have built our platform on open-source technologies that are designed to scale horizontally to support large-scale streaming and batch processing. Our customers can depend on our ‘always-on’ infrastructure. As an example of our scalability, up to one million healthcare providers within the Aetna network link customer digital behavior with net promoter score, or NPS, and customer satisfaction, or CSAT, across their 22 million customers. Our XM Platform adheres to the highest standards of security and privacy demanded by the largest organizations in the world. Our XM Platform enables role-based permissioning to ensure that the right people have access to sensitive customer and employee information. We are ISO 27001 certified and enable our customers to be in compliance with General Data Protection Guidelines, or GDPR and SOC2, and we are certified on Health Information Alliance Trust, or HITRUST. We have achieved Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, authorization to deliver services to United States federal government agencies. Additionally, organizations own and retain all their data gathered on our platform.
•XM Directory. The value our XM Platform delivers to our customers compounds with its use. Our customer data management layer, XM Directory, enables organizations to build a 360 degree view of every customer or employee interaction, capturing feedback, interactions, demographics, operational indicators, and other attributes in a single, unified profile. XM Directory helps to intelligently segment these profiles based on behavior or preferences, provide intelligent analytics on customer journeys, prioritize experience improvements based on deep customer insights, and use those insights to deliver personalized and automated customer outreach at the right moment, with the right message, and via the right channels to drive the most optimal outcomes. Across the Qualtrics customer base, organizations are using the XM Directory to manage more than three billion profiles, with many organizations delivering personalized experiences to hundreds of millions of customers via the XM Directory.
•xFlow. Our platform helps organizations build a culture of action through a software layer called xFlow. These experience workflows allow organizations to use a low code / no-code interface to create automated workflows to close experience gaps at scale.
•Easy Adoption and Rapid Time to Value. Our technology is designed to be easy to deploy, configure, use, and scale. By making the complex capabilities of our XM Platform simple to use, we allow customers of all 
types and sizes to generate value quickly. In addition, the modularity of our platform allows our customers to deploy one or more of our solutions initially and then adopt additional modules as their use cases grow and evolve. As initial deployments generate valuable X-data and the value of that data compounds over time, we see many customers adding additional functionality as the power and influence of experience management insights spread throughout their organizations. 
•Powerful and Multi-Pronged Go-to-Market Model. Our powerful go-to-market model enables us to land both small and large customers initially and expand those relationships significantly over time. The broad adoption of our platform is facilitated by a multi-pronged go-to-market model comprising highly productive field and inside-sales teams, a joint development and solution selling partnership with SAP, and our robust and growing QPN. QPN has over 300 global member companies partnering with us on our XM Platform to help drive breakthrough business outcomes for joint customers. The Qualtrics Developer Platform, or QDP, a core element of QPN, provides deep technical capabilities that enable companies to build robust XM extensions and deliver automated workflows to drive action. 
Our Growth Strategies
Key elements of our growth strategies include:
•Drive New Customer Sales. We believe that our market opportunity remains largely underpenetrated. We will continue to invest aggressively in our direct and indirect sales and marketing capabilities to continue to acquire new customers, including continued growth in the number of enterprise customers. We plan to continue to acquire new customers with our powerful multi-pronged go-to-market model.
•Expand Within Existing Customers. Our customer base of more than 16,750 organizations as of December 31, 2021, represents a significant growth opportunity for us. There is opportunity to expand both the number of users and use cases within an organization. As users start to focus more deeply on specific experiences, they often look to add integrated solutions, Customer Experience, Employee Experience, Product Experience, and Brand Experience. We offer a flexible pricing model that helps further expand our presence within organizations as they increase volume of responses, add solutions and integrations, grow users and employees and increase features and workflows within each solution. Our goal is to increase the number of customers that standardize on our XM Platform within their organization, increasing the number of our organization-wide deployments and creating opportunity for expanded use cases. 
•Expand Our Global Presence. A key focus of our company is to continue to penetrate unaddressed global markets. Constituents can provide feedback in over 75 languages, and our core admin user interface supports over 20 languages. To penetrate markets outside North America, we have developed a hub-and-spoke sales model comprised of centralized inside-sales teams surrounded by regional direct sales groups. Our first two hubs outside North America were in Dublin, Ireland and Sydney, Australia. We have opened sales offices in additional countries, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Sweden, Spain, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. To address data sovereignty concerns amongst our international customers, we have built data centers in Canada, Germany, and Australia. We believe that this investment should further increase our international expansion opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 29% of our revenue came from markets outside the United States, and we believe that there is significant opportunity for continued growth in the global markets.
•Continue to Innovate and Enhance Our XM Platform. As we add to our customer base, we use our technology to draw insights and ensure that we are best serving our customers’ needs. These insights lead to innovative features, such as XM Solutions for creating faster time-to-value, XM Benchmarks to derive deeper insights, XM Automated Actions to quickly close identified experience gaps, and improvements in our iQ product features to drive intelligent action taking. These innovations lead to a greater value proposition for our customers and increased adoption of our XM Platform by both new and existing customers.
•Grow Revenue from Key Industry Verticals. While our XM Platform is industry-agnostic, we have made a number of industry-specific investments that will accelerate our adoption within certain verticals, including government, education, healthcare, technology, and financial services. We have developed Certified XM Solutions, leveraging partners’ expertise, and embedding industry-specific content into our products. Our Certified XM Solutions are packaged projects and programs with expert content, workflow, and automation. In every key vertical, we have reference customers that we believe validate the adoption of our XM Platform.
•Further Develop Our Partner Network. We have developed a network of leading content and consulting partners, delivery partners, and technology partners who enrich our offerings, scale our coverage, and help us reach a broader audience than we would be able to reach on our own. Our partner channel extends our sales reach, enhances our products, and provides implementation leverage both domestically and internationally. Since the launch of QPN in 2018, we have entered into many impactful partnerships with over 300 global member companies, including Accenture, Ernst & Young, Deloitte, IBM, J.D. Power, and Kantar. During 2019, we launched the QDP as a core element of QPN. We will continue to partner with other leading organizations to broaden our reach and maintain our strong net retention rates.
•Jointly Develop, Market and Sell our Solutions with SAP. As part of SAP, we have been able to utilize our partnership to grow and enhance our business. We will continue to jointly develop, market, and sell our solutions with SAP. SAP has a global footprint in over 180 countries, which has allowed us to reach new geographies and expand our international presence faster. Our go-to-market motion has greater enterprise reach through SAP’s global customer base, allowing Qualtrics to be sold alongside SAP applications through our solution selling partnership.

Integrated Solutions
CustomerXM
Our CustomerXM solution is a system of action that enables organizations to gain a true understanding across all forces that impact the customer experience and surfaces these insights in real-time to drive improvements in both micro-level issues (e.g., specific customer remediation situations) and in macro-level issues (e.g., systemic problems with customer care experiences or broken digital journeys). With Qualtrics, organizations can capture, analyze, and then act on customer sentiment across all channels and touchpoints along the customer lifecycle. It provides customer-focused analytics, native to the XM Platform, automated action and workflow capabilities, and no-code/low-code integrations that help organizations take effective, data-driven actions that lead to higher new customer acquisition, reduced customer churn, increased share of wallet, and lower costs to acquire and serve customers.
At the core of our CustomerXM solution is our customer-centric data management system, which consolidates all experience data across all touchpoints, along with relevant operational data, into a single system of record. This enables personalized experiences at scale, deep journey and segment intelligence, and predictions about future behavior. Our listening engine enables omni-channel engagement and data collection across in-app, SMS, interactive voice response, or IVR, chat and call center platforms, messaging apps, social media and review sites, video, voice, 
email and more. Qualtrics iQ, native to the XM Platform, analyzes this data in real time, surfacing recommended actions tailored by role and department. With low/no-code automated actions and workflows, as well as our open developer platform, organizations can quickly take action and deeply embed CustomerXM within existing operational workflow systems. This drives high adoption and action taking across the entire organization, which ultimately leads to meaningful change and business outcomes.
EmployeeXM
Our EmployeeXM solution provides a holistic view of an employee’s experience to help companies reduce unwanted attrition, improve employee engagement, develop and retain top performers, improve customer experience, drive productivity, and build strong teams and cultures. It allows organizations to draw insights from their employees and continuously improve every facet of the employee experience during the employment lifecycle— from recruitment onwards.
We have architected our EmployeeXM solution to meet the exacting requirements of human resource managers. It features workflows that enable employees to seek the right feedback from across the organization, robust administrator rights that enable higher anonymity thresholds, interactive data visualization that conveys the right information to each user, and expert designed, guided action planning surfacing the areas where potential improvements would drive the highest impact. The solution also integrates with a number of HCM and Learning Management System, or LMS, vendors.
ProductXM
Our ProductXM solution helps organizations more successfully build and maintain products and services that their customers love by understanding demand and experience signals across all phases of the product life cycle. This solution identifies actionable insights from identifying a target market, uncovering unmet needs to concept development and initial product marketing. Organizations can quickly determine the top drivers of product satisfaction and loyalty and incorporate experience insights into key product decisions, assisting in product feature prioritization, increasing product decision velocity, and building a customer and data-driven product roadmap.
Our ProductXM solution packages our omni-channel listening capabilities, insights from structured and unstructured data, and automated workflows and actions in a turnkey, guided, easy to use user interface that enables anyone without a degree in statistics to make smart data-driven product decisions. It seamlessly supports contextual operational data such as cost of production, margins or click stream behavioral data to augment human factor data, which enables product teams to identify actionable insights such as key drivers of retention, engagement, or profit maximizing scenarios. With our ProductXM capabilities, product teams can continuously tune their products and services through every phase of the product life cycle.
BrandXM
Our BrandXM solution provides a complete view of all brand experience drivers across the brand funnel from awareness to purchase and post-purchase experience to increase new customer acquisitions, repeat purchases, and share of wallet. This solution delivers automated, real-time analysis to help organizations understand how to improve brand perception and experiences relative to competitors at a specific market and segment level. Marketing teams can quickly optimize brand advertising and communication strategies, as well as work across the organization to improve the experiences that matter most. 
Our BrandXM solution provides real-time, role-based insights that help organizations take the right actions to improve brand perception. It includes workflows that integrate with marketing platforms and other operational systems that enable organizations to improve how a brand is experienced by customers and potential customers alike.
DesignXM
Our DesignXM solution helps organizations uncover the products, services, brands, and cultures that customers and employees want next. Our software helps teams connect with people in authentic ways to create new experiences that shift markets, define brands, establish cultures, and attract new customers. 
These tools are used by market research professionals, marketing teams, product teams, HR teams, academics, insights professionals, data analysts, and developers to do advanced market, customer, and employee research. These customers use DesignXM to adopt a self-service approach to conducting a wide variety of research projects that formerly required hiring expensive outsourced consultants.
Our DesignXM solution can be purchased as software only or can be packaged with expert research services delivered in house, or via our ecosystem partners. 
Qualtrics Developer Platform
The Qualtrics Developer Platform, or QDP, enables customers to seamlessly integrate Qualtrics with their existing applications and workflows and extend the functionality of the XM Platform. QDP includes a robust set of developer tools — including Software Developer Kits, or SDKs, APIs, and workflow configuration tools — for our customers or third-party developers to build data connectors, widgets, plug-ins, visualizations, workflows, and automations. Leveraging the QDP, customers can connect Qualtrics with third-party software systems to automate key business processes, enhance their XM program by bringing experience data from other listening posts into Qualtrics, and extend the XM Platform to address their specific business requirements.
Through the QDP, we provide over 100 out-of-the-box integrations, or XM Extensions, across 30 complementary technology categories with leading enterprise solutions like SAP, Adobe, Atlassian, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, and Zendesk, and applications in adjacent software categories such as digital experience, social analytics, user research, help desk and support, and contact center management. The aforementioned XM Extensions, along with select partner solutions, can be marketed and sold on the XM Marketplace, our enterprise cloud marketplace, or sold directly by our innovation partners. 
Modern Data Processing Architecture
Over 100 million distinct responses are generated each month on our XM Platform. Each piece of X-data represents a distinct data stream, which are combined with related streams generated from social media, enterprise, and third-party integrations via API. Our XM Platform continually aggregates these data streams to provide up-to-the-minute analytics, as well as near real-time analysis across billions of historical data points collected. Our architecture is designed to scale horizontally and cost effectively by combining the Platform-as-a-Service offerings available in public cloud data center facilities and modern open-source technology stacks running within our co-location data centers.
Information Security as a Key Business Enabler
We have achieved multiple information security certifications, including the globally recognized ISO 27001 standard in addition to FedRAMP certification to authorize the use of our XM Platform for U.S. Federal Government agencies. These certifications require ongoing independent validation of our compliance frameworks to provide our customers with confidence in choosing our XM Platform. Our premium Data Isolation feature protects customer response data with a customer specific encryption key. Qualtrics is Privacy Shield certified and provides our customers with self-service tools to help comply with privacy frameworks such as GDPR.
Research and Development
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new technologies, features, and functionality. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, testing, and quality of our XM Platform. We focus our efforts on developing our core technologies and further enhancing their usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility.

Enterprise organizations work with these accredited partners to scope and implement XM programs and to provide ongoing platform customizations. Delivery partners include Acumen Solutions, Ugam (a Merkle company), Workforce Science Associates, and many others.
We will continue to jointly develop, market, and sell our solutions with SAP. Examples include the use of our XM Platform within SAP SuccessFactors to gauge employee sentiment at various stages of the employee lifecycle and create workflows to resolve experience gaps that might lead to dissatisfaction and employee attrition, within SAP’s e-commerce applications to listen and act upon customer sentiment to drive higher conversion rates as consumer buying behavior moves online, and within procurement applications to enable buyers and suppliers to better understand and collaborate with each other. In addition, we have a robust roadmap of potential areas of collaboration across SAP’s product portfolio. As an independent subsidiary of SAP, we will aim to replicate those collaborations with a broader ecosystem of partners. 
Professional Services
Our professional services team helps customers design and execute their market intelligence projects, through our DesignXM offering, and provides our customers with implementation, training, and similar services to help them realize the full benefits of our XM Platform. Our training programs include a mix of virtual and in-person offerings with different options focused either on helping onboard teams of users quickly or helping individuals achieve certification level subject matter expertise. Our team works closely with our partners and enables them to deploy our solutions. By working with these partners, we both augment our pipeline and our ability to scale globally by size and complexity of deployment.
Competition
Experience management is a new and rapidly developing software category. Certain features of our XM Platform compete in certain segments of the overall experience management market. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:
•Providers of software for specific use cases, such as Medallia for customer experience;
•Traditional professional and marketing research services firms, such as Aon Hewitt and Towers Watson; and
•Individual-focused and self-service survey tools, such as Momentive.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:
•Product features, quality, functionality, and design;
•Ease of deployment and use;
•Market vision and pace of product innovation;
•Security and privacy;
•Overall platform experience;
•Third-party integrations; 
•Pricing and total cost of ownership; 
•Brand awareness and reputation;
•Accessibility across several devices, operating systems, and applications;
•Strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
•Customer support.
Some of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. Moreover, because our market is new and rapidly developing, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid technology and content development cycles or lower marketing costs, could introduce new products and services that disrupt our market and better address the needs of our customers and potential customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The experience management software category is relatively new and rapidly changing, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed” for additional information.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of international and domestic registered, pending, and common law trademarks to protect our brand.
In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and other contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Further, many companies in the communications and technology industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may face in the future allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights” for additional information.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had 4,808 full-time employees. We also engage contractors and consultants from time to time. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
At Qualtrics, we live by our TACOS culture, which defines Qualtrics and our employees. TACOS stands for Transparency, All-in, Customer-Obsessed, One-Team, and Scrappy. Our TACOS culture impacts who we hire, how we retain and promote employees, and how we engage with each other and our customers.
We recognize that a person is not simply his or her job, hobbies, or personal life but a mix of all of those pieces. It is this mix — and this ability to bring one’s entire self to work — that cements the foundation of our culture. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, or DEI, is a cornerstone of our company culture. While our TACOS culture is integral to our history, Qualtrics does not thrive without the Q-mmunity, which includes a mix of employee resource 
groups, or Q Groups, that serve to advance the careers, goals, and well-being of the many different communities that make up our employee base. The Q Groups include:
•MosaiQ: Recruits and engages communities of color, as well as amplifies underrepresented voices;
•QPride: Focuses on making Qualtrics a welcoming place to work for members of the LGBTQ+ community;
•QSalute: Concentrates on recruiting military talent;
•Women’s Leadership Development: Aims to empower all women at Qualtrics; and
•Q&Able: Seeks to recruit, develop, and promote people of diverse abilities.
The Q-mmunity strengthens our TACOS culture and underscores our commitment to each other and our customers.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonality in billings with our customers, and we typically record a higher percentage of billings in our fourth quarter, as we have historically executed many of our contracts in the third and fourth quarters due to the fiscal year ends and procurement cycles of our customers. 
Corporate Information
We were formed in 2002 as Qualtrics Labs, Inc. In 2012, Qualtrics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, was established as a new parent company for our operating business. In September 2014, we incorporated Qualtrics International Inc. in Delaware. Through a corporate restructuring in September 2014, Qualtrics, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qualtrics International Inc. In January 2019, we were acquired by SAP America, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAP SE (“SAP”), a multinational corporation that is headquartered in Walldorf, Germany. In January 2021, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “XM.” SAP continues to be our controlling shareholder.
