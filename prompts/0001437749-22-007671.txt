Summary Description of Petrogress
 Petrogress, Inc. is an integrated energy company, engaged in the downstream and midstream segments. The downstream segment comprises refining of crude oil into petroleum products, marketing of crude oil and the refined products; marine transportation, marketing, and retailing of Gas Oil, Naphtha, Fuels and lubricants. The company operates internationally through its wholly owned subsidiaries "Petrogress Int'l LLC." and "Petronav Carriers LLC.". Petrogress is involved in diversified oil and gas activities throughout its branches and representations in Europe and Africa. The Company also provides sea-transportation services -as an independent established Maritime Company- by its tankers fleet either for its own oil products or third parties. Since last year, the company entered into the retailing market by operating a number of Gas-filling stations in Greece.
 
The company maintain its principal marketing and operating executive office at 1, Akti Xaveriou, 18538 Piraeus, Greece.
 
Overview of Petroleum Industry
 Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products is largely driven by the conditions national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part.
 
Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the downstream business, Petrogress competes with fully integrated, other petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities in the refining, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, and petrochemicals.
 
Operating Environment 
 Petrogress Inc., operates as a holding company and conducts business primarily through its subsidiaries: Petronav Carriers LLC., which manages day-to-day operations of the tankers fleet; Petrogress Int’l LLC., which engages in crude oil purchase and sales.

Petrogress operations and direction 
 Our business operates in the downstream and midstream sectors of the energy industry, where we acquire and supply crude oil, and engage in the refining and marketing of refined products and lubricants. As a supplier, we procure crude oil from our direct sources and deliver by our tankers’ fleet to buyers’ destinations. With service centers in the East Mediterranean and West Africa, we believe that we are one of a limited number of independent suppliers that owns and operates a fleet of supplying vessels and conducts physical supply operations in multiple jurisdictions.
 
We provide our customers with services that require sophisticated logistical operations designed to meet their strict oil quality and delivery scheduling needs. We believe that our extensive experience and management systems allow us to meet our customers' specific requirements when they purchase and take delivery of crude oil, refined products and lubricants around the areas in which we operate. This, together with the capital-intensive nature of our industry and the limited available shuttle vessels in the areas of our operation, represent a significant barrier to entry for competitors. We have devoted our efforts to building a global brand and believe that our customers recognize our brand as representing high quality service and products at each of our locations. Throughout our history, we have expanded our business capabilities through strategic alliances, select business and vessel acquisitions, and the establishment of new service centers.
 
Petrogress’s strategy is to leverage its strengths to deliver energy to a growing world. The company’s primary objective is to deliver higher returns, and superior shareholder value in any business environment.

Other Businesses
 Effected as on November 2020, the company concluded the negotiations to lease two Gas refilling stations in the Mainland of South Greece. The procedures for the obtaining the operating licenses from the local authorities are in progress, simultaneously with the preparation of gas stations designs and drawings in order to commence the modernization and renovation under our brand names. As of November 2021, our first gas station commenced its operations and we estimate to complete and have the additional one ready for operations within 2022.
Delivery Commitments
 The company sells crude oil and gas oil from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from its supplier’s. Additionally, with the new developing activities of our innovating gas stations, our vision is to deliver a modern and compelling services to our customers by providing clean fuels to vehicles, convenience stores and restaurants facilities to drivers.
Sales and Marketing
 Most of our marketing, sales, ship-management and other related functions are performed at our main office in Piraeus, Greece. Our sales force interacts with our established customers and markets our oil sales and services to local distributors. We believe our level of customer service, years of experience in the industry, and reputation for reliability are significant factors in retaining our customers and attracting new customers. Our sales and marketing approach are designed to create awareness of the benefits and advantages of our sales and services. The table below shows our trading products volumes and services provided during 2021:

Commodities trade activity
 Commodities trade activity depends mostly on crude oil supply and the competitive purchase prices. Commodities activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $1,767,963 compared to $3,095,506 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $1,327,543 or 43%.
 
Shipping trade activity
 The Company’s shipping activities are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet and the number of operating days during which the vessels generate revenues. In addition, shipping activities are affected also by a number of factors, including the amount of time that the vessels remain positioning, the amount of time spent undergoing repairs and maintenance. Vessels’ employment relies, (i) on time-charter servicing our affiliate company Petrogress Int’l LLC., and (ii) in the spot market to third party charterers. Vessels’ operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $770,368.
 
Commodities operating expenses
 Our commodities operating expenses is related to the location, the terms and conditions we are receiving our crude oil, the logistics cost, the final cost of the process into refined products, and a number of miscellaneous factors beyond of our control. Operating expenses includes, shipping and logistics, fuels supplies, cargo surveys, loading and unloading expenses, agencies and representations, any miscellaneous related to commodities trade. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating expenses decreased by $674,056, compared to 2020.
 
Vessels operating expenses
 Our vessels’ fleet operating expenses include crew wages and related costs, insurances, condition surveys, expenses for repairs and maintenance, classification surveys and certificates, the cost of spare parts and consumable stores, lubricants, bunkers, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. Factors beyond our control, some of which may affect the shipping industry in general, including acts of God, terrorism or piracy attacks, may also increase significantly these expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss of $1,795,946 compared to a loss of $682,915 for 2020.

Depreciation
 We depreciate our tankers fleet on the historical purchase cost over their estimated remaining useful economic lives. We have estimated the useful lives of our tankers for 10years from the purchased year. Depreciation is based on the purchased cost, less the estimated scrap value. Depreciation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 amounted to $521,842, a decrease of 16% or $102,593 compared to $624,435 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Drydocking and Special Survey costs of vessel
 We follow the deferral method of accounting for drydocking and special survey costs. Actual costs incurred are deferred and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period until the scheduled survey, which is two and a half years. If special survey of drydocking is performed prior to the scheduled date, the remaining unamortized balances are immediately written-off. A vessel at drydock performs certain assessments, inspections, refurbishments, replacement required by the classification society. In addition, specialized equipment is required to be renewed and replaced on a vessel which likely are not available at the ports where our ships trade.
 
Competition
 Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil companies, and to a lesser extent, companies that supply alternative sources of energy. We compete, in particular, in the supply of crude oil, acquisition of oil and other petrochemicals, the marketing and delivery of our production into local’s commodity markets and for the equipment required for the shipping, refining and development of those products. Principal methods of competing include low cost of supply, engineering and technology for the refining, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating and producing properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.
 
Factors related to our Fleet Operations
 
Management of our Fleet
 Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Petronav Carriers LLC., we are operating as an international maritime company servicing by our tankers fleet the sea-transportation of liquid products. Our fleet is mostly employed in long-term by the affiliated company, Petrogress Int’l and ship its own products from the loading places to destinations. Additionally, we employ our vessels to a number of independent charterers in the spot market. As managers, we maintain our qualify certifications for the management of our fleet and provide by our expertise technical support and commercial service. Our manager is regarded as an innovator in operational and technological aspects of the International Shipping community with more than 25years professional experience.
 
Risk of Loss and Liability Insurance
 The operation of any vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which imposes virtually unlimited liability upon owners, operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the United States exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for shipowners and operators trading in the United States market.
Environmental and Other Regulations
 Government regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of our vessels. They are subject to international conventions, national, state and local laws, regulations and standards. These laws and regulations include OPA, the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), the U.S. Clean Water Act, MARPOL, regulations adopted by the IMO and the EU, various volatile organic compound air emission requirements and various SOLAS amendments, as well as other regulations described below.
Environmental Regulation—International Maritime Organization; Our vessels are subject to standards imposed by the IMO (the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by ships). The IMO has adopted regulations that are designed to reduce pollution in international waters, both from accidents and from routine operations. These regulations address oil discharges, ballasting and unloading operations, sewage, garbage, and air emissions. For example, Annex III of MARPOL, regulates the transportation of marine pollutants, and imposes standards on packing, marking, labeling, documentation, stowage, quantity limitations and pollution prevention. These requirements have been expanded by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, which impose additional standards for all aspects of the transportation of dangerous goods and marine pollutants by sea. The operations of our vessels are also affected by the requirements set forth in the ISM Code, which was adopted in July 1998.

Environmental Regulation—The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990; OPA established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. It applies to discharges of any oil from a vessel, including discharges of fuel oil and lubricants. OPA affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade in the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which include the United States' territorial sea and its two hundred nautical mile exclusive economic zone. Under OPA, vessel owners, operators and bareboat charterers are "responsible parties" and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the discharge of oil results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels.
 
Environmental Regulation—CERCLA; CERCLA governs spills or releases of hazardous substances other than petroleum or petroleum products. The owner or operator of a ship, vehicle or facility from which there has been a release is liable without regard to fault for the release, and along with other specified parties may be jointly and severally liable for remedial costs. Costs recoverable under CERCLA include cleanup and removal costs, natural resource damages and governmental oversight costs. Liability under CERCLA is generally limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $0.5 million per vessel carrying non-hazardous substances ($5.0 million for vessels carrying hazardous substances), unless the incident is caused by gross negligence, willful misconduct or a violation of certain regulations, in which case liability is unlimited. The USCG's financial responsibility regulations under OPA also require vessels to provide evidence of financial responsibility for CERCLA liability in the amount of $300 per gross ton.
 
Environmental Regulation—The Clean Water Act; The U.S. Clean Water Act (the "CWA"), prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in navigable waters and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA, discussed above. Under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") regulations, we are required to obtain a CWA permit regulating and authorizing any discharges of ballast water or other wastewaters incidental to our normal vessel operations if we operate within the three-mile territorial waters or inland waters of the United States. The permit, which the EPA has designated as the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels ("VGP"), incorporates U.S. Coast Guard requirements for BWM, as well as supplemental ballast water requirements and limits for 26 other specific discharges. Regulated vessels cannot operate in U.S. waters unless they are covered by the VGP. To do so, owners of commercial vessels greater than 79 feet in length must submit a Notice of Intent ("NOI"), at least 30 days before the vessel operates in U.S. waters. To comply with the VGP, vessel owners and operators may have to install equipment on their vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or implement port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial cost. The VGP also requires states to certify the permit, and certain states have imposed more stringent discharge standards as a condition of their certification. Many of the VGP requirements have already been addressed in our vessels' current ISM Code SMS Plan.
Environmental Regulation—The Clean Air Act; The Federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. Our vessels are subject to CAA vapor control and recovery standards for cleaning fuel tanks and conducting other operations in regulated port areas and emissions standards for so-called "Category 3" marine diesel engines operating in U.S. waters. Several states regulate emissions from vessel vapor control and recovery operations under federally approved State Implementation Plans. The California Air Resources Board has adopted clean fuel regulations applicable to all vessels sailing within 24 miles of the California coast whose itineraries call for them to enter any California ports, terminal facilities or internal or estuarine waters. Only marine gas oil or marine diesel oil fuels with 0.1% sulfur content or less will be allowed. If new or more stringent requirements relating to marine fuels or emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the EPA or any states, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations.
Environmental Regulation—Other Environmental Initiatives; The EU has also adopted legislation that requires member states to impose criminal sanctions for certain pollution events, such as the unauthorized discharge of tank washings. The Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control ("Paris MoU"), to which 27 nations are parties, adopted the "New Inspection Regime" ("NIR"), effective January 1, 2011. The NIR is a significant departure from the previous system, as it is a risk-based targeting mechanism that will reward quality vessels with a smaller inspection burden and subject high-risk ships to more in-depth and frequent inspections.
Vessel Security Regulations; Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security. On November 25, 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 ("MTSA") came into effect. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the U.S. Coast Guard issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. The chapter went into effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the International Ship and Port Facilities Security ("ISPS") Code.

IMO Cyber security; The Maritime Safety Committee, at its 98th session in June 2017, also adopted Resolution MSC.428(98)—Maritime Cyber Risk Management in Safety Management Systems. The resolution encourages administrations to ensure that cyber risks are appropriately addressed in existing SMS no later than the first annual verification of the company's Document of Compliance after January 1, 2021. Owner’s risk having ships detained if they have not included cyber security in the ISM Code SMS on their ships by January 1, 2021.
Vessel Recycling Regulations; The EU has also recently adopted a regulation that seeks to facilitate the ratification of the IMO Recycling Convention and sets forth rules relating to vessel recycling and management of hazardous materials on vessels. In addition to new requirements for the recycling of vessels, the regulation contains rules for the control and proper management of hazardous materials on vessels and prohibits or restricts the installation or use of certain hazardous materials on vessels. The new regulation applies to vessels flying the flag of an EU member state and certain of its provisions apply to vessels flying the flag of a third country calling at a port or anchorage of a member state. For example, when calling at a port or anchorage of a member state, a vessel flying the flag of a third country will be required, among other things, to have on board an inventory of hazardous materials that complies with the requirements of the new regulation and the vessel must be able to submit to the relevant authorities of that member state a copy of a statement of compliance issued by the relevant authorities of the country of the vessel's flag verifying the inventory. The new regulation has taken effect on non-EU-flagged vessels calling on EU ports of call beginning on December 31, 2020.
Permits and Authorizations
 We are required by various governmental and other agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our vessels. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required by governmental and other agencies depend upon several factors, including the commodity being transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel's crew and the age of a vessel. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of performing our business.
Inspections by Classification Societies
 Every seagoing vessel must be "classed" by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the vessel is "in class," signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel's country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned. For maintenance of the class, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull and machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classed are required to be performed as follows:
Annual Surveys; For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant, and where applicable, on special equipment classed at intervals of 12 months from the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate.
Intermediate Surveys; Extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and each class renewal. Intermediate surveys may be carried out on the occasion of the second or third annual survey.
Class Renewal Surveys; Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out on the ship's hull and machinery, including the electrical plant, and on any special equipment classed at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. During the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. The classification society may grant a one-year grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial amounts of funds may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period is granted, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel's hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. At an owner's application, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.
