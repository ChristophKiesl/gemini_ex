History
 
We were established as part of the Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Pacific Shores Development, Inc. ("PSD"). PSD and its subsidiary, Jovanovic-Steele, were in the real estate development business, and the real estate crash and the recession of 2008 made it impossible for them to obtain the financing needed to carry on their projects. In 2010, PSD filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California ordered the incorporation of the Company and the distribution of the following securities:

· | 80,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were distributed to all general unsecured creditors of PSD on a pro rata basis according to amount of debt held;

· | 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were distributed to all administrative creditors of PSD, with these creditors receiving one share of common stock in the Company for each $0.10 of PSD's administrative debt held;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | 2,500,000 common stock purchase warrants of the Company were distributed to all administrative creditors of PSD, with these creditors receiving five common stock purchase warrants of the Company for each $0.10 of PSD's administrative debt held. The 2,500,000 warrants consisted of 500,000 "A Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $4.00; 500,000 "B Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00; 500,000 "C Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $6.00; 500,000 "D Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $7.00; and 500,000 "E Warrants" each convertible into one share of common stock at an exercise price of $8.00. All warrants are exercisable at any time prior to August 30, 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The exercise price of the warrants was reduced to $0.10 per share on April 7, 2020, and on April 15, 2020, the warrant expiration date was extended to August 30, 2025.
 
On March 6, 2014, we issued 20,000 common shares for services at par value, $0.0001 per share, for total value of $2. On June 16, 2014, we issued a total of 15,000,000 common shares for services at par value, $0.0001 per share, for total value of $1,500. On August 1, 2017, we issued a total of 10,000 common shares for services at par value, $0.0001 per share, for a total value of $1.
 
On April 3, 2020, the Company, Linda Masters, our Chief Executive Officer and President, entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), pursuant to which Ms. Masters agreed to sell to Lan CHAN 14,960,000 shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 (the “Shares”), representing approximately 95.8% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, for aggregate consideration of Three Hundred Ninety One Thousand Dollars ($391,000) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SPA. The acquisition of the Shares consummated on April 15, 2020, and was purchased by Lan CHAN with his personal funds. As a result of the acquisition, Mr. Chan holds a controlling interest in the Company and may unilaterally determine the election of the Board and other substantive matters requiring approval of the Company’s stockholders.
 
Upon the consummation of the sale of the Shares, Linda Masters, our Chief Executive Officer, President and director, and Kathleen Chula, our Vice President and Director, resigned from all of their positions with the Company, effective April 15, 2020. Their resignations were not due to any dispute or disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices.
 
Concurrently with such resignations, Lan CHAN was appointed to serve as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and sole Director of the Company, until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company and until such director’s successor is elected and qualified or until such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal.

We provide a wide range of interactive game software that targets customers in Hong Kong and China. Notably a number of the games developed, operated or published by us are game adaptations of famous or popular literature, comics or animations. Our game library includes more than 100 games. Our game library consists of our self/co-developed games and third-party developed games. Our self/co-developed games generate revenue primarily from grant a right-to-use to our clients who subscribe to our games via an online portal.

For shopping malls, exhibition organizers and brand owners, we provide customized interactive games according to the intellectual properties, licenses or brands and offer technical consultancy services, including system deployment, service maintenance and user analytics.

Markets and Regions
 
With the development of digital technology, interactive gaming and its applications have increased their footprint in the marketplace. Interactive gaming involves Sound Design, Interface Design, Design Simulation, Navigation Design, Application Design, etc. Today, interactive technology is used in art and games including in museums, commercial special exhibitions, marketing, mutual media, business innovation, theme parks, etc. We communicate with business customers to assist them in converting their thought into feasible technology, as part of their B2B marketing strategies and solutions to appeal to their target audience in the launch of their marketing events and campaigns.
 
Traditional forms of gaming such as PC game and online games with its single form of display are gradually being replaced by interactive gaming. The wide application of interactive game has attracted the attention of the public, mobilizing the enthusiasm of participants. We believe that, in the near future, the multimedia interactive games will be well-accepted, especially in Hong Kong and China. We believe that interactive games will become the trend in the 21th century globally.

Our Strategies
 
We are focused on executing on key strategies to achieve long-term growth in revenues, profit and cash flow. We seek to achieve our targets by delivering innovative and differentiated products that provide value to our clients and exciting experiences. We place great emphasis on developing creative solutions, in terms of interactive game and play, that deliver and sustain superior performance primarily for distributed gaming. This networked strategy often allows us to update our games and operating software remotely, keeping pace with evolving requirements in game play, security, technology and regulations.
 
Our primary objectives are (i) to strengthen our position as an operator and developer in the interactive game industry in Hong Kong and China and (ii) to actively expand into overseas markets in respect of self/co-developed games. To this end, we plan to pursue the following business strategies:
 

· | expand our game portfolio through developing more high-quality self/co-developed games and introducing licensed games with a focus on interactive games;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | continue to secure development rights for popular literatures, comics and animations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fully utilize existing games and development rights to broaden our revenue stream;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhance our game development capacity and increase the investment in game technology to increase the number of self-developed games;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | consolidate our market position and enhance our marketing efforts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | pursue strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | further expand into the interactive gaming market in China;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | broaden reach into international markets; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
We currently develop and operate interactive games. To maximize the value of our self/co-developed games, we intend to explore market opportunities of other geographic markets by offering other language versions (such as English or Malay or Chinese versions) of our self/co-developed games.
 
We strive to introduce high-quality games and deliver a superior game experience to our customers in order to retain their interest in our games. It is our constant endeavour to elevate the awareness of our brand-name in order to associate our brand with high-quality games and appealing game experience. This is achieved through investments in our game development team and staff, upgrades of software such as game engines, game-designing tools, and the acquisition of hardware to accommodate increasing technical demands for operating the games. Furthermore, we believe that our investment in technology, both in terms of hardware and software, would raise the barrier to entry for future competitors as well as maintaining our competitive edge against existing competitors.

Examples of cartoon-themed game and motion-sensing action game.
 
Development and Modification
 
Our project team in our technical department is responsible for creating game logic, in-game graphics as long as music and sound effect. The project team may further adopt other interactive technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), human motion sensing, gesture control, location-based detection, projection mapping and other special effects to our game so as to maximize the gaming experience for our players. We engage external service providers for the soundtracks, motion pictures and part of the artwork associated with the game. We also engage external third party services providers for special-themed game artwork.

During the development process, our project team will test-play the game to look for errors, bugs, lagging, faulty designs and etc. This is a continuous process until the project manager is satisfied with the performance and the overall playability of the alpha version.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS 
 
We expect to rely on, trade secrets, copyrights, know-how, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our “Luduson” brand, as well as its related products and services. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
 
The laws of Hong Kong, China and our target countries may not protect our brand and services and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, if at all. We may be unable to fully protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. Further, companies in the internet, social media technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
 
We intend to seek the widest possible protection for significant product and process developments in our major markets through a combination of copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, patents, confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions, if applicable. We anticipate that the form of protection will vary depending upon the level of protection afforded by the particular jurisdiction. We expect that our revenue will be derived principally from our operations in Hong Kong and China where intellectual property protection may be limited and difficult to enforce. In such instances, we may seek protection of our intellectual property through measures taken to increase the confidentiality of our findings.
 
We intend to register trademarks as a means of protecting the brand names of our companies and products. We intend protect our trademarks against infringement and also seek to register design protection where appropriate.
 
We rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. We expect that, where applicable, we will require our employees to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment with us. We expect these agreements to provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. The agreements will also provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of our company. There can be no assurance, however, that all persons who we desire to sign such agreements will sign, or if they do, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.
 
We also devote financial and operational resources to implement systems, processes and technologies to guard against cyber events and to help protect our intellectual property, employee and consumer data and information technology systems against intrusions or other security breaches. In addition, we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services, including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and re-balancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered.  
 
COMPETITION
 
Competition in the game industry is intense in Hong Kong and China. We compete with other game developers, operators and publishers of interactive games in Hong Kong and China. We may also face competition from emerging mobile game developers, operators and publishers, as well as some traditional online PC game companies that are entering the mobile game market. The game industry is fragmented and sensitive to price and service. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

9
-


· | strong in-house game development expertise with a track record of successful games and robust pipeline;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | leading publishing platform;
--+-----------------------------


· | large game portfolio and diversified publishing network; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | collaborative culture led by a stable management team.
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | local presence and understanding of local business trends;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to minimize the time-to-market of the game solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to build up a high volume of game titles in the library;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to form partnership with famous IP and brand owners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to assist our client to generate positive feedback on adopting our products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | strength and recognition of our brand.
--+---------------------------------------

 
Although we believe we compete favorably on the factors described above, many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, larger product and services offerings, larger customer base and greater brand recognition. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer base with lower development costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.
 
These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger customer base more effectively than us. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. In addition, although we do not believe that customer payment terms are a principal competitive factor in our market, they may become such a factor, and we may be unable to compete on such terms.
