Residential Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Overview
 
Homes and buildings use energy for heating, cooling, hot water, and electrification. A number of factors determine how much energy is required to deliver these services including the age of the structure, type of construction, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment used and its condition, lighting, appliances, and electronics used. Different types of energy are used for these end-uses, which is often based on regional energy production and availability, historical construction preferences, and local legislation. Energy sources include, but are not limited to natural gas, heating oil, utility electricity, and on-site renewable energy generation.
 
Based on home conditions and energy sources, energy efficiency improvements are often the lowest cost ways to reduce ongoing utility and maintenance costs. Energy efficiency improvements often result in improved living comfort, for example enhanced heating, cooling, lighting, and air quality. Energy efficiency upgrades have an up-front cost but are designed to reduce ongoing utility and maintenance costs. Upgrades also often result in increased home values and resale prices.
 
Experts in the building community agree that energy efficiency upgrades are often the least expensive form of energy available, as they do not require the creation of energy. By investing in energy conservation measures, homeowners will realize immediate and ongoing benefits. 
 
Homes and commercial buildings consume 40% of the energy used in the United States. Most homeowners could save between 15-25% of their utility bills by addressing wasted energy from drafts, air leaks, and outdated heating and cooling systems. Typical energy efficiency upgrades include sealing air leaks, adding insulation, installing more efficiency windows, doors, and skylights, installing and properly setting programmable thermostats, sealing ducts, tuning or upgrading heating and cooling systems, installing energy efficiency hot water heaters, upgrading household appliances and electronics to Energy Star products, and installing energy efficient lighting.
 
Many different approaches to building construction exist, often based on geographic and prevailing weather conditions. Those construction approaches, along with upfront cost, are factors in what type of energy source and heating and cooling equipment is installed. There are always trade-offs between cost, performance, and lifespan. When upgrading home energy systems, selecting the most appropriate equipment will have significant impacts on long-term operational costs, maintenance, and replacement requirements.

Improvements in electric heat exchanger (also known as heat pump) technology have increased their usage across the country. Different types of heat pump technologies exist. Some transfer energy from water sources and others directly from the air. Water source heat pumps are often connected to geothermal systems, also known as ground source heating and cooling. Since geothermal technologies rely on transferring energy from the earth instead of creating energy, they are widely considered the most efficient type of heating and cooling systems. 
 
On-site renewable energy generation has been improving greatly for years with gains in performance and reductions in cost. The most typical type of on-site generation is photovoltaics, also known as solar energy. Panels are typically installed on a roof-mounted configuration or on an adjacent ground-mounted system. Inverters capture the solar energy and transform it into useful electricity. Most residential systems are tied to the existing electrical utility grid for back-up and resiliency when solar energy is not being generated.
 
There are many trade-offs when determining the most appropriate energy generation systems for residences. Upfront cost, maintenance, replacement cost, environmental and health impacts much all be considered. Environmental health and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of utility electricity is a regional consideration based on how energy is produced and distributed in different regions. How utility-scale electricity is generated can make a large different in associated emissions. On-site renewable energy has a significantly lower carbon footprint than most utility-scale generation, though many utilities are transitioning to cleaner sources such as solar and wind as they move away from coal-fired power plants.
 
Indoor air quality in a home can also be impacted by the type of HVAC system installed. Unless fresh outdoor is brought into through an intake system before being distributed, air will be recirculated within a home, which can compromise air quality. The use of natural gas for cooking and clothes dryers can also adversely impact indoor air quality. Typically, electrified HVAC, cooking, and clothes dryers offer the highest quality indoor air quality, but there are many factors including air infiltration, sealing, and opening of windows and doors that will impact conditions. The use of building materials, paints, and stains with high levels of volatile organic compounds can also contribute to degraded indoor air quality.
 
Homeowners must weight all factors when it comes to heating, cooling, and electrification of their homes. Choosing systems that minimize the use of fossil fuels and maximize airflow will often lead to the best indoor air quality.
 
GSP System
 
On March 16, 2020 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of an unrelated third party named Fourth Wave Energy, Inc. (“FWI”), a Colorado corporation, for 6,200,000 restricted shares of our common stock. In 2021, 4,350,000 of these shares were returned to us and cancelled.
 
FWI has designed an energy system which is based on combining solar power and other energy efficient technologies into one fully integrated system. The FWI energy system is designed to significantly reduce energy consumption and associated carbon emissions in residences and commercial buildings.
 
In connection with this acquisition we entered into consulting agreements with certain founders of FWI. The consulting agreements required us to collectively pay $385,000 in consulting fees during the terms of the consulting agreements, all but one of which expire between May 31 and June 30, 2020. One consulting agreement is for a twelve month period and expires in March of 2021.
 
On May 7, 2020 we signed an option agreement with GEOS Neighborhood, LLC to acquire approximately 8 acres of undeveloped land in Arvada, Colorado. If the option was exercised we planned to build energy efficient homes/townhomes on the undeveloped land. We did not exercise the option and the option expired on June 18, 2020.
 
After the option with GEOS Neighborhood's expired, we decided to proceed with the development of a clean energy system known as the GeoSolar Plus System ("GPS").
 
The GSP system is designed to significantly reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions in residences and commercial buildings, while improving indoor air quality. By improving the building envelope, reducing energy loads, and generating on-site renewable solar energy the system offers a highly-efficiency whole-home energy upgrade. 
 
We planned to use a sales force that would market the GSP system directly to homeowners and planned to use independent subcontractors to replace a home’s existing heating and air conditioning system with the GSP system.

As of March 31, 2021 no GSP Systems had been sold.
 
DeSol Power Tiles
 
On August 18, 2020 we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent to acquire DeSol Power Tiles, LLC for $900,000 in cash and shares of our common stock having a value of $100,000.
 
DeSol Power Tiles is based in Atlanta, Georgia and has developed solar panels which act as the actual roof of a building.
 
Although traditional solar panels provide financial benefits to their owners and solar systems help the environment, they are not aesthetically pleasing to look at. Some communities and subdivisions even have rules against installing them.
 
The DeSol solar roof system integrates design and functionality. The patented system uses roof tiles, not solar panels, so it won’t affect the aesthetic or architectural appeal of the roof. With a simple, flat design, based on the classic Nordic style, DeSol roof tiles will complement the home with a beautiful, completely sealed, walkable surface that covers the entire roof. 
 
The DeSol solar roof system captures sunlight and the inverter converts the sunlight into electric current that can be used in the home. An electric panel in the home feeds the energy from the inverter to the home’s electric circuits. The electric meter monitors energy usage, so excess power can be sent to the utility company, giving the homeowner energy credits.
 
A solar roof installation from DeSol Power Tiles is 100% passive. Unlike wind energy systems or heat pumps, there are no moving parts that require technical service or maintenance, which is the main reason for the 30-year performance guarantee which is offered by DeSol Power Tiles.
 
   
As of March 31, 2021 DeSol Power Tiles had installed two solar roof systems.
 
For more information concerning DeSol Power Tiles visit its website at https://www.desolpowertiles.com/.
 
The acquisition of DeSol Power Tiles is subject to a number of conditions, including the execution of a definitive agreement between the parties.

Spin-Off
 
We plan to concentrate on the sale of solar panel roofs and no longer plans to pursue the GSP System. As a result, on March 10, 2021, we transferred all of the rights to the GeoSolar Plus System (“GSP”) to GeoSolar Technologies, Inc. ("GST") in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of GST's common stock. We plan to distribute ("Spin-Off") these shares to our shareholders on the basis of one share of GST's common stock for each four shares held by each of our shareholders.
 
GST also assumed all liabilities (approximately $385,000) associated with the consulting agreements previously signed by us. 
 
The Spin-Off is subject to the effectiveness of a registration statement that GST will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The date for determining which of our shareholders will receive shares of GST in the Spin-Off (the "Record Date") will be determined shortly before the effective date of GST's registration statement. 
 
Other Information
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had one employee.
 
Our offices are located at 75 E. Santa Clara St., 6th Floor, San Jose, CA, 95113.
