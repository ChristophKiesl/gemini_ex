ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
Summary of Business Results and Plans
In September 2019 a holding company reorganization was completed in which Famous Dave’s of America, Inc. (“FDA”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent holding company named BBQ Holdings, Inc. (“BBQ Holdings”). As used in this Form 10-K, “Company”, “we” and “our” refer to BBQ Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries. BBQ Holdings was incorporated on March 29, 2019 under the laws of the State of Minnesota, while FDA was incorporated in Minnesota on March 14, 1994. We develop, own and operate restaurants under the name “Famous Dave’s”, “Clark Crew BBQ”, “Granite City Food & Brewery” and “Real Urban Barbecue.” Additionally, we franchise restaurants under the name “Famous Dave’s”. As of January 3, 2021, there were 125 Famous Dave’s restaurants operating in 31 states, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates, including 27 Company-owned restaurants and 98 franchise-operated restaurants. Included in the Famous Dave’s company-owned restaurant total are four restaurants purchased in July 2019 in Arizona (“Arizona Restaurants’) and four restaurants purchased in March 2019 in Colorado (“Colorado Restaurants”). The first Clark Crew BBQ restaurant opened in December 2019 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. BBQ Holdings has a 20% ownership in this venture. On March 9, 2020, we purchased 18 Granite City Food & Brewery restaurants (“Granite City Acquisition”) in connection with a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. On March 16, 2020, we purchased one Real Urban Barbecue restaurant located in Vernon Hills, Illinois. In October 2020, we signed a 25-unit development agreement with Bluestone Hospitality Group (“Bluestone”) whereby Bluestone will open Famous Dave’s ghost kitchens and dual restaurant concepts with the Johnny Carino’s Italian brand. 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic and the United States declared a National Public Health Emergency. As a result, public health measures were taken to minimize exposure to the virus. These measures, some of which are government-mandated, were implemented globally resulting in a dramatic decrease in economic activity. “Stay-at-home” orders with the exception of conducting certain essential functions, quarantines, travel restrictions and other governmental restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have had an adverse impact on our company’s business. From mid-March through April, all of our Company-owned restaurants operated on a take-away, mobile pick-up and delivery basis only in order to protect our employees and customers from the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to comply with the government mandates. Beginning in May, we gradually began opening our restaurants for dine-in at 25% to 50% capacity pursuant to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. While all but one of our Company-owned restaurants began operating under limited-capacity in-store dining by mid-June 2020, in late October, some locations were required to reduce or eliminate in-store dining due to new COVID restrictions through the end of 2020. Although we have experienced some recovery from the initial impact of COVID-19, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy and on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted (see Note 1 Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies). Due to the continuous development and fluidity of this situation, we cannot determine the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations.

In addition to these locations, we opened five Company-owned Famous Dave’s ghost kitchens operating out of our Granite City locations, and six Famous Dave’s franchisee ghost kitchens operating out of the kitchen of another restaurant location or a shared kitchen space.
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to certain metrics of our franchise-operated restaurants; however, franchise-operated restaurants are not owned by us and therefore are not included in our consolidated results of operations and financial position. We believe that disclosure of certain information related to franchise-operated restaurants provides useful information to investors as the performance of franchise-operated restaurants directly impacts royalty and other revenues that we receive from our franchisees and has an impact on the perceived success and value of the Famous Dave’s brand.
Financial Information about Segments
Since its inception, our revenue, operating income and assets have been attributable to the single industry segment of the foodservice industry. Our revenue and operating results for each of the last two fiscal years, and our assets for each of the last two fiscal years, are disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Narrative Description of Business
We operate four casual dining concepts under the names Famous Dave’s, Clark Crew BBQ, Real Urban Barbeque and Granite City Food & Brewery. As of January 3, 2021, we operated 27 Famous Dave’s restaurants, a Clark Crew BBQ, a Real Urban Barbeque and 18 Granite City restaurants. Additionally, as of January 3, 2021, we had 98 Famous Dave’s Franchise locations. 
Famous Dave’s Overview
Famous Dave’s restaurants, a majority of which offer full table service, feature wood-smoked and off-the-grill entrée favorites that fit into the barbeque category. We differentiate ourselves by providing high-quality food in distinctive and comfortable environments with signature décor and signage. Our prototypical design includes a designated bar, a signature exterior smokestack, a separate entrance for our to-go business and a patio. The Famous Dave’s concept can be adapted to fit various location sizes and desired service styles such as full-service, counter-service or line service. 

4



Each restaurant features a distinctive selection of authentic hickory-smoked and off-the-grill barbecue favorites, such as flame-grilled St. Louis-style and baby back ribs, Texas beef brisket, Georgia chopped pork, country-roasted chicken and signature sandwiches and salads. Also, enticing side items, such as corn bread, potato salad, coleslaw and Wilbur BeansTM, accompany the broad entrée selection. Handmade desserts, including BBQ Holdings Bread Pudding and Banana Pudding, are another specialty. To complement our entrée and appetizer items and to suit different customer tastes, we offer six regional barbeque sauces: Rich & Sassy®, Texas PitTM, Georgia MustardTM, Devil’s Spit®, Sweet and ZestyTM and Wilbur’s RevengeTM. These sauces, in addition to a variety of seasonings, rubs, marinades and other items are also distributed in retail grocery stores throughout the country under licensing agreements.
We believe that a renewed focus on enhancing our guests’ experience and listening to their feedback is essential. Over the years, we have evolved our format to that of a full-service concept with several “prototypical” designs that incorporate the best attributes of the past restaurants while providing a consistent brand image. We believe a positive guest experience, combined with our high-quality food, makes Famous Dave’s appeal to a diverse and broad demographic profile. We expect to continue refreshing our corporate restaurants in 2021 to a format that we believe will appeal to a younger demographic while still resonating with our core guest. Given the shift in food delivery, we are working on two formats with franchisees – one with a pick-up window and another as a full drive-thru concept. Throughout 2020, we also continued to enhance the various guest facing initiatives we implemented. In addition to our mobile app, we also rolled a SMS-text program, and enhanced our online ordering experience. 
Granite City Overview
The Granite City restaurant theme is upscale casual dining with a wide variety of menu items that are prepared fresh daily, including Granite City’s award-winning signature line of hand-crafted beers finished on-site. The extensive menu features moderately priced favorites served in generous portions. Granite City’s attractive price point, high service standards, and great food and beer combine for a memorable dining experience.
Our prototypical Granite City restaurant consists of an approximately 9,800 square foot facility conveniently located just off one or more interstate highways and centrally located within the respective area’s retail, lodging and transportation activity. Granite City restaurants have open atmospheres as well as floor-to-ceiling window systems creating, where designs permit, expansive views of outdoor patio areas used for dining during warm weather months. This window treatment allows activity to be viewed both inside and outside the restaurant and creates a bright, open environment. We use granite and other rock materials along with natural woods and glass to create a balanced, clean, natural interior feel. The interiors are accented with vintage photographs of the local area brewing industry, as well as historical photos of the community landscape. We believe our design creates a fun and energetic atmosphere that promotes a destination dining experience. 
The core of our Granite City concept is the wide variety of items on our menu which are freshly prepared from scratch and served in generous portions. This is complemented by a wide selection of hand-crafted cocktails, wines and our own signature beers. Our menu is committed to full-flavored ingredients and is based on strict preparation of distinctive items not generally featured on restaurant chain menus. We create new menu items and monthly specials on a regular basis that are staff and guest-tested and refined before menu implementation. 
In addition to operating our restaurants, we operate a centralized beer production facility which facilitates the initial stages of our brewing process. The product produced at our beer production facility is then transported to the fermentation vessels at each of our Granite City restaurants where the brewing process is completed. We believe that this brewing process improves the economics of microbrewing as it eliminates the initial stages of brewing and storage at multiple locations. Our company holds patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for our brewing process and for an apparatus for distributed production of beer. 
Real Urban Barbeque Overview
Real Urban Barbecue built its reputation on authentic, wood fired BBQ favorites. Real Urban’s award-winning menu is served in a comfortable, casual environment built around a line service model that is efficient for operators and convenient for guests. The casual BBQ theme at Real Urban is highlighted by unique custom designed BBQ centric

décor, roadside signage, and handwritten menus proudly displayed on oversized chalkboards. The interior is designed around corrugated metal, barn wood accents, and a warm color scheme that enhances the dining experience. We believe the casual, neighborhood environment created by the custom décor and comfortable booths creates a local hangout that guests are proud to have in their neighborhood. Guests can find all the BBQ staples including; Ribs, Brisket, Pork, Chicken, and Sausage. The sizeable menu also includes a variety of side dishes and handmade desserts. After opening in 2012, Real Urban quickly became known for its sweet and savory BBQ sauce that is proprietary to the brand. Guests crave the smooth, tomato-based sauce that is the perfect blend of savory and sweet.
Real Urban or as it is affectionately known to regulars, RUB, differentiates itself by generating revenue from several lines of business. Dine in, takeout, catering and a robust consumer packaged goods business all contribute to the success of Real Urban. A strategic partnership with Lou Malnati's Taste of Chicago catalog has allowed the concept to ship large quantities of products nationwide.
Operating out of less than 4,000 square feet, Real Urban is efficient and right sized for the current restaurant environment. Real Urban operates as a single unit in Vernon Hills, IL., and tailors their menu offerings to the community it serves. Special menu offerings are rolled out each year featuring specials for graduations, weddings, mitzvahs, corporate meetings, and many more events. Acquired in 2020 by BBQ Holdings, we believe that Real Urban Barbecue will benefit from the buying power, marketing support, and the implementation of enterprise level technology that is not readily available to single unit locations. 
Clark Crew BBQ Overview
Clark Crew BBQ launched in December 2019 with great anticipation from the community in Oklahoma City. Featuring premium, slow-smoked proteins, and hand-crafted sides, Clark Crew quickly became one of the top-grossing restaurants in all of Oklahoma. The concept was built around one of the most decorated pitmasters to ever compete on the KCBS BBQ circuit, Travis Clark. Travis and his crew have competed on the biggest BBQ stages in the world and racked up over 700 Top-10 awards, along with World Championships, National Team of the Year, and Oklahoma Team of the Year before shifting their focus to opening a BBQ restaurant that would allow Travis to share his talents with the masses. In partnership with BBQ Holdings the dream to open Clark Crew BBQ was quickly realized when all parties involved had the same goal; to create an upscale BBQ concept that offers competition quality BBQ to the communities it serves. BBQ Holdings has a 20% ownership interest in this venture (see Note 15 Variable Interest Entities).
The Clark Crew restaurant theme was built around a dedicated smokehouse that would be the pride of any pitmaster. Featuring Old-Hickory and Camelback high-end smokers and ample room to produce some of the world’s best BBQ, the smokehouse provides great viewing opportunities for guests entering the restaurant while the sweet smoky smell of BBQ fills the neighboring community. Boasting over 8,000 square feet, Clark Crew is the perfect sized footprint for the flagship location of an emerging BBQ concept. 
The walls at Clark Crew are lined with authentic, one of kind BBQ awards that chronicle the success Travis Clark had on the competitive BBQ circuit. A large dining room overlooks an open kitchen. Pass through the dining room and you find a full-service bar area with custom barstools featuring the initials CCB, which exemplify Travis’ attention to detail in everything that he does. Just past the bar is a well shaded patio that features a large gaming area with synthetic turf, a fire pit, and a stage that regularly hosts live music. 
The menu at Clark Crew BBQ is filled with traditional BBQ favorites such as ribs, pork, chicken, sausage, and even smoked bologna. The item that differentiates Clark Crew from the rest is the Snake River Farms American Wagyu Brisket. You will not find a premium protein like this at most BBQ restaurants. These high-end cuts are typically reserved for the competition BBQ circuit where prize money and dreams of becoming a grand champion motivate the pitmaster. A wide variety of sides, signature burgers, hand-cut steaks cooked over a real wood fire, brick oven pizza, and house-made are also available on the well thought out menu. A bar menu featuring an exhaustive beer list and signature Crew Cocktails round out the menu offerings at Clark Crew.

Growth
In fiscal 2020, we opened five Company-owned Famous Dave’s locations and our franchisees opened 10 Famous Dave’s locations. Eleven of those 15 locations were ghost kitchen locations*.

Ghost kitchen locations either operate out of the kitchen of another restaurant location or a shared kitchen space. 
In fiscal 2021 we plan to open, with the help of our franchisees, our new line-service prototype design that we have been working on for the last 12-18 months, both with and without a drive-thru. This design will be built from the learnings we have had opening our smaller footprint locations, as well as the current model being executed at our Real Urban BBQ location. Through our new prototype and ghost kitchen locations, we expect 10-15 units to open in fiscal 2021 We offer conversion packages that provide our franchisees with the flexibility to convert existing restaurants as well as existing retail footprints into a Famous Dave’s restaurant. Given the flexibility and scalability of our concept, we believe that there are a variety of development opportunities available now and in the future. 
In addition to ghost kitchens, we opened our first dual concept location in fiscal 2020 in Colorado Springs, CO. This dual concept puts two restaurant concepts (Famous Dave’s BBQ and Texas T-Bone Steakhouse) under the same roof utilizing the same staff and one menu. We are encouraged by the results and look to continue testing this dual concept prototype in 2021. 
During 2020 as we faced the pandemic, we moved to a simplified menu in order to streamline our operations as we navigated traffic declines and supply chain shortages. As dining rooms have started to re-open, we have introduced some of those items back while also keeping a few locations on the simplified menu to continue this test. We will continue to evaluate the performance of these menu interations and allow us to make educated menu decisions in 2021 and beyond. 
As we continue to learn from our experiences in 2020, we plan to test and innovate with technology in our back of house operations as we work to further streamline process and improve efficiencies..
Operating Strategy
Our ability to achieve sustainable profitable growth is dependent upon delivering high-quality experiences in terms of food and hospitality, consistently. Key elements of our strategy include the following:

7



During fiscal 2020, we continued to focus on operational excellence and integrity, and on creating a consistently enjoyable guest experience, both in terms of food, food delivery and hospitality, across our system. While this changed throughout the year as we dealt with the pandemic, we believe our commitment to our guests remained intact as we evolved our service models. 
We define operational excellence as unyielding commitment to superior service for our guests during every visit. We continue to look for ways to provide convenience and value to our guests through reducing ticket times and streamlining off-premise operations. Operational excellence involves daily monitoring to ensure we execute our recipes at a high level inclusive of preparation, cooking, and handling procedures, rotation, sanitation, cleanliness and safety.
Our menus focus is on several popular smoked, barbequed, grilled meats, entrée items, delicious side dishes and appetizers which are prepared using proprietary seasoning ingredients, sauces and mixes. In order to enhance our appeal, expand our audience, increase frequency, and feature our craveable products our culinary team has developed a product pipeline, which will allow us to offer new and exciting items throughout the year.
Human Resources and Training/Development - A key ingredient to our success lies with our ability to hire, train, engage and retain employees at all levels of our organization. We place a great deal of importance on creating an exceptional working environment for all of our employees. Through our human resource and training and development resources, tools and programs, we continually enhance and support superior performance within our restaurants and support center.
We are a performance-based organization, committed to recognizing and rewarding performance at all levels of the organization. Our performance management process includes performance calibration as a means of providing measurable, comparative employee evaluations relative to peer contribution, taking into account specific core competencies and goals. It is designed to provide a complete picture of performance that is consistent across the organization. We offer a total rewards program that is benchmarked closely against the industry and includes health and welfare coverage, 401(k) and non-qualified deferred compensation with a company match, base pay and incentive pay programs developed to sustain our competitive position in the market. Our human resource and training teams focus on the selection and retention of talent through programs in overall workforce planning, performance management, development, safety and risk reduction, and continued enhancements in our organizational structures for all positions in the business.
In the training and development arena, we offer a variety of ongoing on-the-job and classroom and eLearning training programs for the operations teams (hourly employees, restaurant managers) in an effort to create defined career paths. Our management training program provides new restaurant managers a foundational-based training for restaurant operations and several learning sessions focused on the basic behaviors and skills of a manager.
Restaurant Operations
Our ability to manage multiple restaurants in geographically diverse locations is central to our overall success. In each market, we place specific emphasis on the position of the general manager and executive chef and seek talented individuals that bring a diverse set of skills, knowledge, and experience to our company. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the careful training and supervision of employees and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to performance, food and beverage preparation, and maintenance of facilities.
All managers must complete an eight-week training program, during which they are instructed in areas such as food quality and preparation, customer service, hospitality, and employee relations. We have prepared operations manuals relating to food and beverage quality and service standards. New employees participate in training under the supervision of our management. We have a comprehensive operations scorecard and training tool that helps us measure the operational effectiveness of our restaurants. We have a senior vice president of operations who is responsible for overseeing all Company-owned restaurants. This individual as well as our area directors, work closely with the store-level management to support day-to-day restaurant operations. In addition, the senior vice president and area directors assist in the professional development of our store-level management and are instrumental in driving our vision of 

8



operational integrity and contributing to the improvement of results achieved at our restaurants, including building sales, developing personnel and growing profits. The area directors oversee 8-12 locations, depending upon concept, and report to our senior vice president of operations. Our senior vice president of operations reports directly to our chief operating officer. 
Off-Premise Occasions - Focus on Convenience
In addition to our lively and entertaining dine-in experience, we provide our guests with maximum convenience by offering an expedient take-out service along with catering and delivery. The level of take-out varies from concept to concept. As an example, to-go business at Famous Dave’s is approximately 62% of its revenue, compared to Granite City where to-go business is approximately 27% of its revenue. The high quality, fair prices and avoidance of preparation time make take-out of our product particularly attractive. Our off-premise sales provide us with revenue opportunities beyond our in-house seating capacity and we continue to seek ways to leverage these segments of our business. We see catering and delivery as a tremendous opportunity for new consumers to access our business. Every restaurant has dedicated vehicles to support our catering initiatives and many restaurants are served by multiple third-party delivery providers.
At Famous Dave’s, our restaurants have been designed specifically to accommodate a significant level of to go sales, including a separate to go entrance with prominent and distinct signage, and, for added convenience, we separately staff the to go counter. To further enhance sales for all our brands, we offer our guests the ability to order online to improve convenience. We believe our focus on to go enables us to capture a greater portion of the “take-out” market by allowing consumers to “trade within our brands,” when dining in is not always an option. We pursue efforts to increase awareness of to go in all Company-owned and franchise-operated restaurants by featuring signage and merchandising both inside and outside the restaurants. Additionally, we contract with several Delivery Service Providers (“DSP”) to offer our guests additional methods for receiving our food.
Guest Satisfaction – We believe that we achieve a significant level of repeat business by providing high-quality food, efficient friendly service, and warm caring hospitality in an entertaining environment at moderate prices. We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our restaurants through the purposeful hiring, training and supervision of personnel and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards of performance, food preparation and facility maintenance. We have also built family-friendly strategies into each restaurant’s food, service and design by providing children’s menus, smaller-sized entrees at reduced prices and changing tables in restrooms.
Value Proposition and Guest Frequency – We remain competitive with our value offerings across our brands and are committed to offering consistent, quality products at a compelling everyday value. We offered Famous Deals, throughout fiscal 2020 at Famous Dave’s. The promotion is intended to drive weekday dine-in traffic. We re-evaluated the promotion at the onset of dining room closures and offered the promotion to go for the first time. Not only did the offers increase traffic, but we were also able to successfully maintain check averages and profit by requiring the purchase of a beverage when guests purchased a Famous Deal to-go. At Granite City we launched a Daily Deals promotion in June of 2020. The Daily Deals promotion featured $5 burgers and many other food and drink specials, each offered on a specific day of the week. Granite City’s guests quickly responded to the offers and guest counts steadily increased. Daily Deals averaged well over 4,000 units per week sold and we have continued to maintain that volume into fiscal 2021. All our brands benefited from the rollout of family-style meal options. Each of these promotional offers were built around value and convenience, allowing guests to feed a group of four for as little as $29.99. Bundled meal deals, 2 for $20 offers, free delivery, and free dessert promotions were also used across the brands in fiscal 2020 to further reinforce our value message. 
Granite City launched a new loyalty program in October of 2020 and quickly surpassed 25,000 downloads of their new loyalty app. The loyalty program will be the primary tool for measuring guest frequency in 2021 and beyond.
Marketing, Promotion and Sales
BBQ Holdings’ brands rely on digital marketing, direct marketing, social media, word of mouth and strategic partnerships to advertise to new guests. The internal marketing team is responsible for the advertising, promotion, 

9



creative development and branding for all BBQ Holdings concepts. Franchise operated Famous Dave’s restaurants place the advertising and marketing programs in their local market based on contractual requirements. 
Additionally, as part of our overall marketing strategy we have prioritized the acquisition of guest data across all brands to deploy retargeting messages and digital messaging directly to a guest mobile device through email, SMS Text and mobile app push notifications. New, modern and mobile friendly websites were deployed at Famous Dave’s, Granite City and Clark Crew BBQ in fiscal 2020 with a goal to enhance each guests digital experience and improve search engine rankings with a renewed focus on Search Engine Optimization and site structure. 
Each brand will continue to focus our marketing efforts on building off-premise sales, while welcoming back dine in guests when they are ready for a full-service dining experience. Promotions with delivery services partners were leveraged during strategic times throughout the year for each brand. Inclement weather and the onset of the pandemic presented an opportunity to increase delivery sales through third party apps and the BBQ Holdings Brands were well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. 
We leveraged our internal marketing channels, as well as paid social media campaigns, successfully during all the major holidays in 2020. Bundled theme meals and special occasion offers were utilized across the brands to build sales on key holidays such as Mother’s Day, Easter, Father’s Day, Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Famous Dave’s surpassed 2019 sales figures on every major holiday in 2020. Other calendar events such as National Pork Month, National Beer Month and many others are leveraged for creative marketing promotions designed to spark interest and incite trial. 
To further develop the advertising and promotional materials and programs designed to create brand awareness and increase the reach of the brand, we have a system wide marketing fund. All company owned Famous Dave’s restaurants, and franchise operated restaurants with agreements signed after December 17, 2003 are generally required to contribute 1% of net sales to this fund.
Location Strategy
We prepare an overall market development strategy for each market. The creation of this market strategy starts with identifying trade areas that align demographically with the target guest profile. The identified trade areas are then assessed for viability and vitality and prioritized by sales and unit level margin opportunity for future development. Since markets are dynamic, the market strategy includes a continual and ongoing assessment of all existing restaurant locations. If financially feasible, a restaurant may be relocated as the retail or residential focus in a trade area changes. 
The ghost kitchen service model will allow us to access new markets or strategically locate restaurants in existing markets where a full-service restaurant is unlikely to be financially viable. The surrounding trade area will determine which service style is appropriate. Additionally, we may choose to build out Company-owned line service and drive-thru concepts. Site selection will focus on converting second-generation space cost effectively. We intend to finance company restaurant development using cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations, through availability on our revolving line of credit and future additional debt.
We expect to continue to grow our Famous Dave’s franchise program. Our goal is to continue to improve the economics of our current restaurant prototypes, while providing more cost-effective development options for our franchisees. We believe the new line service and drive-thru prototypes will allow for this expansion.
Purchasing
In order to maximize quality and operational efficiencies our food products, we strive to obtain consistent quality items at competitive prices from reliable sources, including identifying secondary suppliers for many of our key products. Additionally, our secondary suppliers help us assure supply chain integrity and better logistics. Finally, to reduce freight costs, we continually aim to optimize our distribution networks, where the products are shipped directly to the restaurants through our foodservice distributors. Each restaurant’s management team determines the daily quantities of food items needed and orders such quantities to be delivered to their restaurant. 

10



Approximately 90% of our food and non-alcoholic beverage purchases collectively across brands are on contract, with the majority being proteins. In the three barbecue centric brands, pork represents approximately 32% of our total purchases, while beef, which includes hamburger and brisket, is approximately 14%, chicken is approximately 14%, and seafood is approximately 2%. In our Granite City brand, beef represents 21% of total purchases, while poultry is approximately 16%, seafood 3%, various other proteins making up approximately 12%, and produce making up another large portion of our spend at approximately 8%.
We realize the volume of leveraging our spend across our various brands and where applicable align contract pricing on like items to drive down landed costs. 
Our purchasing team is also responsible for managing the procurement of non-food items for our restaurants, including restaurant equipment, smallwares and restaurant supplies. They also contract many of our restaurants repair and maintenance services along with managing our utility costs.
Information Technology
We recognize the importance of leveraging information and technology to support and extend our competitive position in the restaurant industry. We continue to invest in initiatives that provide secure and efficient operations, enhance the guest experience and provide benchmarks that allow us to evaluate our operational metrics.
We utilize industry-leading service providers and cloud services to streamline processes at both the restaurant and support center. Interfaces between point-of-sale, labor management, inventory management, menu management, digital platforms and financial systems are the foundation of our enterprise analytics platform. We also continue to implement and support solutions to capitalize on current digital market trends to drive sales and realize operational efficiency.
Trademarks
Our company has registered various trademarks, makes use of various unregistered marks, and intends to vigorously defend these marks. We highly value our trademarks, trade names and service marks and will defend against any improper use of its marks to the fullest extent allowable by law.
Franchise Program
Our goals include, to be a valued franchisor; to enhance communication and recognition of best practices throughout the system and to continue to expand our franchisee network domestically and internationally. Our growth and success depends in part upon our ability to attract, contract with and retain qualified franchisees. It also depends upon the ability of those franchisees to successfully operate their restaurants with our standards of quality and promote and develop Famous Dave’s brand awareness.
 Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees, and our franchise agreements include certain operating standards, each franchisee operates his or her restaurants independently. Various laws limit our ability to influence the day-to-day operation of our franchise restaurants. We cannot assure you that the franchisees will be able to successfully operate Famous Dave’s restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards for operational excellence, service and food quality.

Our franchise operations department is led by our director of franchise operations, who guides the efforts of our two franchise business consultants. The director of franchise operations and the franchise business consultants have the responsibility of supporting our franchisees throughout the system. The director of franchise operations and the franchise business consultants manage the relationship between us and our franchisees and provide an understanding of the roles, responsibilities, differences, and accountabilities of that relationship. They are active participants towards enhancing performance, as they partner in strategic and operations planning sessions with our franchise partners and review the individual strategies and tactics for obtaining superior performance for the franchisee. They ensure compliance with obligations under our area development and franchise agreements. Franchisees are encouraged to utilize all available assistance from the franchise business consultants and the support center but are not required to do so. Our director of franchise operations reports directly to our senior vice president of operations.
We have a comprehensive operations scorecard and training tool that helps us measure the operational effectiveness of our franchise-operated restaurants. This scorecard is used to evaluate, monitor and improve operations in areas such as guest satisfaction, health and safety standards, community involvement, and local store marketing effectiveness, among other operating metrics. Also, we generally provide support as it relates to all aspects of franchise operations including, store openings and operating performance. Finally, we solicit feedback from our franchise system by having an active dialogue with all franchisees throughout the year.
The franchisee’s investment depends primarily upon restaurant size. This investment includes the area development fee, initial franchise fee, real estate and leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment, point-of-sale systems, business licenses, deposits, initial food inventory, smallwares, décor and training fees as well as working capital. In fiscal 2020, certain franchisees were required to contribute 1.0% of net sales to a marketing fund dedicated to providing digital and creative services. Currently, franchisees are required to spend approximately 1.5% of their net sales annually on local marketing activities.
Seasonality
Our Famous Dave’s restaurants typically generate higher revenue in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year as a result of seasonal traffic increases and high catering sales experienced during the summer months. Our Granite City restaurants typically generate higher revenue in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year as a result of warmer weather and increased patio seating in the second quarter and holiday activity in the fourth quarter. 
Government Regulation
Our company is subject to extensive state and local government regulation by various governmental agencies, including state and local licensing, zoning, land use, construction and environmental regulations and various regulations relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, disposal of refuse and waste products, public health, safety and fire standards. Our restaurants are subject to periodic inspections by governmental agencies to ensure conformity with such regulations. Any difficulty or failure to obtain required licensing or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant, and the suspension of, or inability to renew a license, could interrupt operations at an existing restaurant, any of which would adversely affect our operations. Restaurant operating costs are also affected by other government actions that are beyond our control, including increases in minimum hourly wage requirements, worker’s compensation insurance rates, health care insurance costs, property and casualty insurance, and unemployment and other taxes. We are also subject to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We are also subject to extensive state and federal government regulation by various governmental agencies due to our digital and social media footprint in the collection of customer’s or potential customer’s data. This includes data storage and privacy laws on a state and federal basis.
As a franchisor, we are subject to federal regulation and certain state laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws impose substantive requirements on franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. As proposed, such legislation would limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply.

The 1990 Federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We have in the past and could in the future be required to incur costs to modify our restaurants in order to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons. Our restaurants are currently designed to be accessible to the disabled, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to this Act.
Team Members
As of January 3, 2021, we employed approximately 2,417 team members of which approximately 238 were salaried full-time employees. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relationships with our team members.
