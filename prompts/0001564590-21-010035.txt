Item 1. Business. 
 We are a global gene therapy company dedicated to transforming the lives of people affected by rare diseases through the development of innovative, potentially curative gene therapies. Our ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, gene therapy approach harnesses the power of genetically modified blood stem cells and seeks to correct the underlying cause of disease in a single administration. We seek to achieve this outcome by utilizing a lentiviral vector to introduce a functional copy of a missing or faulty gene into the patient’s own, or autologous, HSCs through an ex vivo process, resulting in a gene-modified cellular drug product that can then be administered to the patient at the bedside. 
 To date, over 160 patients have been treated with our product candidates across seven different diseases, with follow-up periods of more than 10 years following a single administration. We believe the data observed across these development programs, in combination with our expertise in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of gene and cell therapies, position us to provide potentially curative therapies to people suffering from a broad range of diseases. 
 We are currently focusing our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach on three therapeutic disease areas: neurodegenerative, immunological and blood disorders. Our portfolio includes two commercial-stage products approved in Europe, seven lentiviral-based product candidates in clinical-stage development and several other product candidates in preclinical development. Our two lead programs are OTL-200, which was approved in the European Union, or EU, United Kingdom, or UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway under the brand name Libmeldy for eligible patients with early-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD, and OTL-103, which is being investigated for the treatment of Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, or WAS. For each of our lead product candidates, we are in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities with respect to the clinical and other data required for future regulatory submissions.  In late 2020, for instance, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared our investigational new drug, or IND, application for OTL-200, and we plan to complete interactions with the FDA to determine the path to file a biologics license application, or BLA, by mid-2021. We plan to file a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for OTL-103 in Europe by year-end 2021 and a BLA for OTL-103 in the U.S. in 2022. 
 We have a broad and advanced portfolio of commercial-stage products, and research and development-stage product candidates, and we believe our approach of using lentiviral vectors to genetically modify HSCs has wide-ranging applicability to a large number of indications. The ability of HSCs to differentiate into multiple cell types allows us to deliver gene-modified cells to multiple physiological systems, including the central nervous system, immune system and red blood cell and platelet lineage, thereby potentially enabling the correction of a wide range of diseases. By leveraging the innate self-renewing capability of HSCs that are engrafted in the bone marrow as well as the ability of lentiviral vectors to achieve stable integration of a modified gene into the chromosomes of HSCs, our gene therapies have the potential to provide a durable effect following a single administration.

The diseases we are targeting affect patients around the world, requiring an infrastructure to deliver gene therapies globally. In order to meet anticipated demand for our pipeline of approved products and product candidates still in development, we are utilizing our existing network of contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to manufacture lentiviral vectors and drug product. In addition, we have established process development capabilities in London, UK, and are leveraging technologies that will allow us to deliver our gene therapies globally. 
 Cryopreservation of our gene-modified HSCs is a key component of our commercialization strategy to deliver potentially curative gene therapies to patients worldwide, facilitating both local treatment and local or cross-border product reimbursement. In anticipation of commercialization, we developed cryopreserved formulations of Libmeldy (OTL-200) and OTL-103 and are collecting supportive clinical data from patients treated with cryopreserved formulations to support the analytical comparability to the fresh cell formulations used in our registrational clinical trials. The registrational trials for all our earlier stage product candidates are expected to be conducted using a cryopreserved formulation. 
 We have global commercial rights to all our clinical product candidates and plan to commercialize our gene therapies in key markets worldwide, including in Europe and the U.S. initially, subject to obtaining the necessary marketing approvals for these jurisdictions. We plan to deploy a focused commercial infrastructure to deliver Libmeldy and our product candidates, if approved, to patients and are focused on working closely with all relevant stakeholders, including patients, caregivers, specialist physicians and payors, to ensure the widest possible post-approval access for our product candidates. In addition, we may rely on third parties to assist with regulatory submissions, disease awareness, patient identification and reimbursement in countries where local expertise is required or where we do not have a direct presence.  For example, in January 2021, we announced partnerships with two regional specialty pharmaceutical companies with experience in rare genetic diseases to support us in the Middle East and Turkey.
 As we continue to develop and expand our portfolio, we believe that the experience of our management team and our extensive academic relationships are key strategic strengths. Our management team has extensive experience in rare diseases and in the manufacturing, preclinical and clinical development and commercialization of gene and cell therapies. In addition, we partner with leading academic institutions around the world, which are pioneers in ex vivo autologous HSC-based gene therapy. We plan to leverage our internal expertise combined with our relationships with leading academic institutions to transition our lead clinical-stage product candidates to commercialization and continue to expand our portfolio of ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy products. 
 Our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach 
 Our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach seeks to transform a patient’s autologous HSCs into a gene-modified cellular drug product to treat the patient’s disease. HSCs are self-renewing cells that are capable of differentiating into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets and tissue resident macrophages, which include the microglia of the central nervous system. HSCs can be obtained directly from the bone marrow, which requires administration of a general anesthetic, or from the patient’s peripheral blood with the use of mobilizing agents, which are agents that can move HSCs from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood for easier collection. The HSCs collected are then manufactured to insert a functional copy of the missing or faulty gene. By delivering gene-modified HSCs back to patients, we seek to take advantage of the self-renewing capability of HSCs to enable a durable effect following a single administration, as has been seen in our commercial and development programs. Since these cells are recognized by the body as the patient’s own cells, the risks associated with using donor cells may be reduced. In addition, the ability of HSCs to differentiate into multiple different cell types has the potential to enable the delivery of gene-modified cells to different physiological systems and allow the correction of a broad range of different diseases. 
 Clinical validation already exists for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, an approach of treating a patient with a genetic disease with HSCs contributed by a healthy donor individual, thereby using HSCs that contain a functioning copy of the gene of interest. However, this approach has significant limitations, including difficulties in finding appropriate genetically matched donors and the risk of graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related rejection and mortality from these and other complications, and is therefore typically only offered on a limited basis. Furthermore, genetically modified cells can be used to express enzyme activity at supra-physiological levels, which we believe has the potential to overcome the limitations of HSCT (where enzyme expression is generally limited to normal levels) to treat some neurometabolic disorders and improve the metabolic correction in neuronal cells before irreversible degeneration occurs. Our approach is intended to address these significant limitations of HSCT.

In a preclinical study conducted by one of our scientific advisors and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, or PNAS, a subpopulation of gene-modified HSCs has evidenced the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, engraft in the brain as microglia and express genes and proteins within the central nervous system, one of the important physiological systems targeted by our HSC gene therapy approach. As published in PNAS, images taken during the study show a cross-section of the brain of a mouse that was infused intravenously with HSCs, which had been genetically modified using a lentiviral vector carrying green fluorescent protein, or GFP. The GFP expression observed throughout the brain illustrates the potential of gene-modified HSCs to cross the blood-brain barrier, engraft in the brain and express the functional protein throughout the brain, thereby potentially addressing a range of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Libmeldy (OTL-200), for instance, leverages this same mechanism of action to deliver gene-modified HSCs that can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver a therapeutic gene that can prevent neuronal degeneration. The study demonstrated widespread distribution and expression of GFP in the brain of a mouse model following intravenous administration of HSCs transduced with GFP encoding vector.
 With respect to Libmeldy (OTL-200) and each of our product candidates, our ex vivo gene therapy approach utilizes a self-inactivating, or SIN, lentiviral vector to introduce a functional copy of the missing or faulty gene into the patient’s autologous HSCs through an ex vivo process called transduction, resulting in a cellular drug product that can then be re-introduced into the patient. Unlike some other viral vectors, such as adeno-associated viral, or AAV, vectors, lentiviral vectors integrate into the chromosomes of patients’ HSCs. We believe this allows us to achieve stable integration of the functional gene into the HSCs and can lead to durable expression of the target protein by the gene-modified HSCs and their progeny after a single administration of gene therapy. In contrast, because AAV vectors rarely integrate into the genome, the transgene is not passed on to all progeny when the cell divides, resulting in rapid dilution and loss of the transgene among frequently dividing cells such as HSCs. Regarding immunogenicity, because in vivo delivery of AAV places the vector into direct contact with the immune system and most individuals harbor some type of pre-existing immunity, including neutralizing antibodies, to one or more types of AAV vector, the incoming vector can be completely inactivated by the patient’s immune system.  Furthermore, there have been reports that certain high dose applications of AAV have resulted in acute and severe innate immune responses that have proved lethal.  With ex vivo delivery, however, the vector is not introduced directly into the body and vector elements are washed away in the laboratory such that there is little to no vector element left to present to the immune system. Our HSC gene therapies and product candidates are all manufactured ex vivo. Strimvelis is the only gammaretroviral vector-based gene therapy in our portfolio. 
 The image below illustrates the steps in our approach to transform a patient’s autologous HSCs ex vivo into therapeutic product. 

Initial clinical trials conducted using our product candidates utilized a fresh product formulation, resulting in a limited drug product shelf life. We plan to market Libmeldy (OTL-200) and our current and any future product candidates, if approved, in a cryopreserved product formulation, which is designed to extend the drug product shelf life and enable the shipment of the drug product to specialized treatment centers, allowing patients to receive treatment closer to their home while leveraging more centralized manufacturing. Cryopreservation also allows us to conduct a number of quality control tests on the genetically modified HSCs prior to introducing them into the patient. 
 6


In addition, certain of our clinical-stage product candidates have been evaluated in registrational trials using drug product derived from HSCs extracted from the patients’ bone marrow. To optimize our potential product label and the number of patients that we may be able to treat, as part of any BLA or MAA submission for such product candidates, we plan to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patients’ peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patients’ bone marrow. In cases where clinical trials were conducted using vector and/or drug product manufactured at academic centers, we plan to demonstrate comparability between vector and/or drug product manufactured by our third party commercial CDMOs with vector and drug product manufactured at such academic centers. 
 Initially, we are employing our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach in three therapeutic disease areas: neurodegenerative, immunological and blood disorders. Data from clinical trials suggest that ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy has the potential to provide generally well-tolerated, sustainable and improved outcomes over existing standards of care for diseases in these areas. We believe that we can apply our approach beyond our initial target indications to treat an even broader range of diseases. 
 Our strategy 
We are building a leading, global, fully-integrated gene therapy company focused on transforming the lives of people affected by severe diseases.  To achieve this, we are pursuing the following strategies:
  
• | Launch Libmeldy (OTL-200) for the treatment of eligible patients with early-onset MLD in Europe, following its approval in December 2020 and expand geographically into new markets as regulatory approvals are obtained
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance our clinical-stage product candidates towards marketing approvals, with a near term focus on OTL-200 for MLD in the U.S., OTL-103 for WAS in Europe and the U.S., and our clinical-stage programs in neurodegenerative disorders, including OTL-203 for MPS-I and OTL-201 for MPS-IIIA
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the power of our therapeutic approach to investigate the potential of HSC gene therapy in larger indications
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in new technologies and innovations to continue to improve our manufacturing processes for lentiviral vector and drug product and reduce costs of goods manufactured
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish end-to-end process development, manufacturing and supply chain capabilities, initially through third parties and internally over time
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish a patient-centric, global commercial infrastructure, including with third parties in certain regions where we do not have a direct presence
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Execute a business development strategy to leverage our HSC gene therapy approach, expand geographically, accelerate time-to-market or attract disease-area expertise to optimize the value of our portfolio of product candidates or expand into new indications
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our pipeline 
 We have one of the deepest and most advanced gene therapy pipelines in the industry spanning multiple therapeutic areas where the disease burden on children, families and caregivers is immense and current treatment options are limited or do not exist. Our programs focused on neurodegenerative disorders consist of our commercial program approved in Europe, Libmeldy (OTL-200) for MLD, two clinical proof of concept-stage programs, OTL-203 for mucopolysaccharidosis type I, or MPS-I, and OTL-201 for mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, or MPS-IIIA, and three preclinical programs, OTL-202 for mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB, or MPS-IIIB, OTL-204 for frontotemporal dementia with progranulin mutations, or GRN-FTD, and OTL-205 for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.  Our programs in immunological disorders consist of our commercial program approved in Europe, Strimvelis for adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency, or ADA-SCID, two advanced registrational clinical programs, OTL-101 for ADA-SCID and OTL-103 for WAS, one clinical proof of concept-stage program, OTL-102 for X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, or X-CGD, and one preclinical program, OTL-104 for Crohn’s disease with mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2, or NOD2-CD. Our clinical proof of concept-stage program, OTL-300 for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, or TDT, is focused on a life-threatening blood disorder.

The nature of our autologous gene therapy product candidates precludes the conduct of Phase 1 safety studies in healthy volunteers. Moreover, considering the indications our product candidates are intended to treat, which are often fatal without treatment and which are rare indications with high unmet medical need, we believe our clinical programs will generally be eligible to proceed to registration based on a single pivotal study given the bioethical considerations regarding the conduct of randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials with gene therapies for such indications.  For purposes of this Annual Report, we refer to an exploratory study, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 1 or Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as a proof of concept trial, and a confirmatory efficacy and safety study to support submission of a potential marketing application with the applicable regulatory authorities, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 2/3 or Phase 3 clinical trial or a pivotal trial, as a registrational trial. 
 The status of these programs is outlined below:

Neurodegenerative Disorders 
 Gene therapy for treatment of MLD 
 Disease overview 
 MLD is a rare and life-threatening inherited disease of the body’s metabolic system occurring in approximately one in every 100,000 live births in most regions of the world. Higher incidence rates are reported in geographies of higher consanguinity, such as Turkey and the Middle East. MLD is caused by a mutation in the arylsulfatase-A, or ARSA, gene that results in the accumulation of sulfatides in the brain and other areas of the body, including the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, and/or spleen. Over time, the nervous system is damaged, leading to neurological problems such as motor, behavioral and cognitive regression, severe spasticity and seizures. Patients with MLD gradually lose the ability to move, talk, swallow, eat and see. In its late infantile form, mortality at five years from onset is estimated at 50% and 44% at 10 years for juvenile patients.
 8


Limitations of current therapies 
 Prior to the approval of Libmeldy (OTL-200) in Europe, there were no effective treatments or approved therapies for MLD. Palliative care options involve medications for seizures and pain, antibiotics and sedatives, on a case-by-case basis, as well as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and tube feeding or gastrostomy when patients can no longer eat without assistance. Palliative care addresses the symptoms of MLD but does not slow or reverse the progression of the underlying disease. HSCT has limited and variable efficacy in arresting disease progression and, as a result, HSCT is not considered to be a standard of care for this disease. MLD patients, their caregivers and families, and the healthcare system have faced significant burdens given the severity of the disease and the lack of effective treatments. 
 Our solution, Libmeldy (OTL-200) for treatment of MLD
 OTL-200 is designed as a one-time therapy that aims to correct the underlying genetic cause of MLD, offering eligible patients the potential for long-term positive effects on cognitive development and maintenance of motor function at ages at which untreated patients show severe motor and cognitive impairments. With OTL-200, a patient’s own HSCs are selected, and functional copies of the ARSA gene are inserted into the genome of the HSCs using a lentiviral vector before these genetically modified cells are infused back into the patient. The ability of the gene-corrected HSCs to migrate across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, engraft, and express the functional enzyme has the potential to persistently correct the underlying disease with a single treatment. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to this program through our asset purchase and license agreement with GSK, or the GSK Agreement. The clinical trials for this program have been conducted under a GSK-sponsored clinical trial authorization, which was transferred to us during the third quarter of 2018. 
 
Libmeldy approval in Europe as Orphan Drug
 
In December 2020, the European Commission granted full, or standard, marketing authorization for Libmeldy (OTL-200) (autologous CD34+ cell enriched population that contains hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase-A (ARSA) gene) for the treatment of early-onset MLD characterized by biallelic mutations in the ARSA gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic activity in children with i) late infantile or early juvenile forms, without clinical manifestations of the disease, or ii) the early juvenile form, with early clinical manifestations of the disease, who still have the ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive decline.
 Libmeldy has received orphan drug designation from the EMA for the treatment of MLD and orphan drug status was maintained at the time of approval. We are continuing to follow patients in the clinical development program for up to 15 years as a post-marketing commitment, and data will be presented to regulators at agreed points in order to further characterize the long-term efficacy and safety of Libmeldy, particularly in the early symptomatic early juvenile population. 
 Data Supporting the Clinical Profile of Libmeldy 
 The European Commission approval is supported by clinical studies of Libmeldy in both pre- and early- symptomatic, early-onset MLD patients. Early-onset MLD encompasses the disease variants traditionally referred to as late infantile, or LI, and early juvenile, or EJ.
 Clinical efficacy was based on the integrated analysis of results from 29 patients with early-onset MLD who were all treated with Libmeldy prepared as a fresh formulation:
  
• | 20 patients were treated in a registrational study (median follow-up of 4 years); 9 patients were treated in expanded access programs (median follow-up of 1.5 years)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 16 patients had a diagnosis of LI MLD; 13 had a diagnosis of EJ MLD
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At the time of treatment, 20 patients were deemed pre-symptomatic; 9 were deemed early-symptomatic
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinical safety was evaluated in 35 patients with early-onset MLD:
  
• | 29 patients from integrated efficacy analysis (described above)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | 6 patients treated with the cryopreserved formulation of Libmeldy
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Co-primary endpoints
The co-primary endpoints of the integrated efficacy analysis were Gross Motor Function Measure, or GMFM, total score and ARSA activity, both evaluated at 2 years post-treatment. Results of this analysis indicate that a single-dose intravenous administration of Libmeldy is effective in modifying the disease course of early-onset MLD in most patients.
 Pre-symptomatic LI and EJ patients treated with Libmeldy experienced significantly less deterioration in motor function at 2 years and 3 years post-treatment, as measured by GMFM total score, compared to age and disease subtype-matched untreated patients (p≤0.008). The mean difference between treated pre-symptomatic LI patients and age-matched untreated LI patients was 71.0% at year 2 and 79.8% at year 3. Similarly, the mean difference between treated pre-symptomatic EJ patients and age-matched untreated EJ patients was 52.4% at year 2 and 74.9% at year 3. Although not statistically significant, a clear difference in GMFM total score was also noted between treated early-symptomatic EJ patients and age-matched untreated EJ patients (28.7% at year 2; p=0.350 and 43.9% at year 3; p=0.054).
 A statistically significant increase in ARSA activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed at 2 years post-treatment compared to pre-treatment in both pre-symptomatic patients (20.0-fold increase; p<0.001) and early-symptomatic patients (4.2-fold increase; p=0.004).
 At the time of the integrated data analysis, all treated LI patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment up to 7.5 years and 10 out of 13 treated EJ patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment of up to 6.5 years. No treatment-related mortality has been reported in patients treated with Libmeldy.
 Key secondary endpoints
For EJ patients who were early-symptomatic when treated with Libmeldy, meaningful effects on motor development were demonstrated when these patients were treated before entering the rapidly progressive phase of the disease (IQ≥85 and Gross Motor Function Classification, or GMFC, ≤1). By 4 years post-disease onset, an estimated 62.5% of treated, early-symptomatic EJ MLD patients survived and maintained locomotion and ability to sit without support compared with 26.3% of untreated early-symptomatic EJ MLD patients, representing a delay in disease progression following treatment with Libmeldy.
 A secondary efficacy endpoint that measured cognitive and language abilities as quantified by Intelligence Quotient/Development Quotient, or IQ/DQ, found in the treated LI subgroup, 12 out of 15 assessed patients had a fairly constant IQ/DQ, within the normal range (IQ/DQ score of 100 +/- SD of 15) throughout follow-up. All but two of these patients (i.e., one pre-symptomatic and one early-symptomatic) remained above the threshold of severe mental disability (IQ/DQ>55) at chronological ages at which all 14 untreated comparator LI patients showed evidence of severe cognitive impairment, which is defined as IQ/DQ below 55 and close to zero. Of the 10 surviving EJ patients, all 4 pre-symptomatic patients and 4 out of 6 early-symptomatic patients showed normal IQ/DQ throughout follow-up. In contrast, 11 out of 12 untreated EJ patients showed evidence of severe cognitive impairment during follow-up.
 Clinical trial with cryopreserved drug formulation
 The cryopreserved formulation of OTL-200 is being studied in a clinical trial of pediatric patients with pre-symptomatic LI , or pre- to early-symptomatic EJ in Milan, Italy.
 The primary goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-200 in early-onset MLD patients, as measured by improvement in gross motor function and ARSA activity levels in the patients’ blood cells as well as overall survival. Secondary goals for this clinical trial include assessment of cognitive function through IQ. 
 Ten patients were treated in this trial between April 2017 and April 2020. All patients tolerated the administration well and for those with enough follow-up post-treatment, preliminary evidence of engraftment and restoration of ARSA activity in peripheral blood to supraphysiological levels and in cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, to normal levels has been shown. 
 Data Supporting Safety Profile of Libmeldy
 At the time of the integrated data analysis in December 2019, which data set consisted of 29 patients treated with the fresh (investigational) formulation, all treated LI patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment up to 7.5 years, and 10 out of 13 treated EJ patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment of up to 6.5 years. No treatment-related mortality has been reported in patients treated with Libmeldy.
 10


The median duration of follow-up in the first nine patients treated with the cryopreserved (commercial) formulation was 15 months as of March 2020.
 The most common adverse reaction attributed to Libmeldy was presence of anti-ARSA antibodies, or AAA. Five out of 35 patients tested positive for AAA at various post-treatment time points. Antibody titers were generally low and resolved either spontaneously or after a short course of rituximab. In all patients with positive AAA test results, no negative effects were observed in the post-treatment ARSA activity of peripheral blood or bone marrow cellular subpopulations nor in the ARSA activity within the cerebrospinal fluid. In addition to the risk associated with the gene therapy, treatment with Libmeldy is preceded by other medical interventions, namely bone marrow harvest or peripheral blood mobilization and apheresis, followed by myeloablative conditioning, which carry their own risks. During the clinical studies, the safety profiles of these interventions were consistent with their known safety and tolerability.
 For more details, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, for Libmeldy.
 Additional clinical trial in Europe
 A clinical trial in late juvenile patients with MLD is open for recruitment in Milan, Italy.
 OTL-200 development in the U.S.
 
OTL-200 has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MLD as well as Rare Pediatric Disease designation.   In late 2020, the FDA cleared our IND application for OTL-200 in the U.S., and in January 2021, FDA granted regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation for OTL-200.  The IND includes a Phase 3b study with inclusion of early symptomatic early juvenile MLD patients and a prospective planned analysis of data from patients already treated in clinical studies in Italy. We plan to complete interactions with the FDA by mid-2021 to determine the path to file a biologics license application, or BLA, with the FDA. In parallel, we plan to initiate a Phase 3b clinical study in the early symptomatic early juvenile MLD patient population, which is planned to commence at a study site in the U.S. in mid-2021 and to be completed as post-BLA commitment.
 Gene therapy for treatment of MPS-I
 Disease overview 
 Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, or IDUA. Inherited deficiency of IDUA is responsible for MPS-I. Without treatment, clinical manifestations of this severe disease include skeletal abnormalities with severe orthopedic manifestations, hepatosplenomegaly, neurodevelopmental decline, sight and hearing disturbances, cardiovascular and respiratory problems leading to death in early childhood. IDUA deficiency can result in a wide range of clinical severity, with 3 major recognized clinical entities: Hurler, or MPS-IH, Scheie, or MPS-IS, and Hurler-Scheie, or MPS-IH/S, syndromes. Hurler and Scheie syndromes represent phenotypes at the severe and attenuated ends of the MPS-I clinical spectrum, respectively.
 The median age of diagnosis for MPS-IH is 12 months; most affected children are diagnosed before 18 months of age. Infants affected by MPS-IH usually appear normal at birth, but may develop inguinal or umbilical hernias in the first six months, and develop the characteristic somatic phenotype over the first few years of life. 
 The approximate incidence of MPS-I is of one in 100,000 live births.  Approximately 60 percent of children born with MPS-I have MPS-IH.
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Allogeneic-HSCT with pre- and peri-transplant enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, from diagnosis to engraftment has been established as the standard of care for MPS-IH patients diagnosed before the age of 30 months and with presumed MPS-IH (presence of family history and/or clinical signs and symptoms compatible with MPS-IH, i.e., phenotypic diagnosis based on clinical expertise), and/or homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for mutations associated with the severe phenotype. The recommendation that HSCT should be standard of care for MPS-IH patients is endorsed by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.
 Despite its established position in treatment algorithms, allogeneic-HSCT can result in alloreactive complications, including potentially fatal graft versus host disease, or GvHD, particularly when the degree of matching between graft donor and 
 11


recipient is low. Additionally, although it may stabilize cognitive decline, life-threatening or severely debilitating cognitive, neurological, orthopedic, cardiac, respiratory and ophthalmic manifestations of MPS-IH have been reported during long-term post-HSCT follow-up. 
 Our solution, OTL-203 for treatment of MPS-I 
 Ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy strategies aimed at correcting the genetic defect in patients could represent a significant improvement for the treatment of MPS-I, notably MPS-IH the most severe and prevalent phenotype with the highest unmet medical need, when compared to current treatments.  
 OTL-203 is a single administration, gene therapy product candidate consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched HSPCs, derived from mobilized peripheral blood, genetically modified ex vivo with the lentiviral vector encoding for the IDUA complementary DNA, or cDNA. It is being developed as a cryopreserved formulation. Ex vivo autologous gene therapies, such as OTL-203, are designed to correct the genetic defect in patients’ own HSCs and their progeny by addition of corrective cDNA. The OTL-203 mechanism of action addresses the disease pathophysiology by restoring enzymatic IDUA expression in peripheral and central body compartments as well as restoring microglia homeostasis and its neuroprotective effects against the neurotoxic effects of glycosaminoglycan, or GAG, accumulation in affected cells. We have obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to OTL-203 from Telethon Foundation and San Raffaele Hospital.
 Autologous cells may be genetically modified to constitutively express supra-normal levels of the therapeutic enzyme and become a quantitatively more effective source of functional enzyme than wild-type cells, possibly also at the level of the nervous system and bone. 
 The therapeutic potential of this approach for addressing the extensive nervous system manifestations of MPS-IH is based on the contribution of HSCs to the turnover of CNS-resident microglia, demonstrated both in physiological and pathological conditions. Since microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including LSDs. These cells should be considered a primary target cell type in therapeutic strategies for LSD with neurologic involvement such as MPS-IH. Moreover, compared to allogeneic transplantation, which is the current standard of care for MPS-IH treatment, the autologous nature of OTL-203 is associated with a significantly reduced transplant-related morbidity and mortality and avoids the risks of graft versus host disease.
 
OTL-203 has received orphan drug and PRIME designation from the EMA as well as orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for the treatment of MPS-I.
Ongoing clinical trials
 OTL-203 is currently being investigated in an ongoing, academic-sponsored clinical trial at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy to establish proof of concept. The study is a prospective, single dose, single center, non-randomized, open label study involving a single administration of OTL-203 in eight patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS-IH. The study is fully enrolled using a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-203. 
 
The patients evaluated in this trial include pediatric MPS-IH patients from 14 to 35 months of age at the time of treatment and will be followed for at least 2 years post-treatment in the context of the proof of concept study and then continue to be evaluated in a long-term follow-up study. 
 Interim results for all eight patients were presented at the WORLDSymposium in February 2021.  As of November 2020, follow-up in all patients reached at least 12 months and the interim data supporting clinical proof-of-concept illustrated that treatment with OTL-203 was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the selected conditioning regimen. IDUA antibodies present prior to gene therapy as a result of ERT were not seen in any patient within two months following treatment. In addition, ERT was discontinued at least three weeks prior to any patient receiving gene therapy treatment, and no patients had re-started ERT post-treatment.
 In terms of biomarker data, treatment demonstrated rapid and sustained metabolic correction with all patients achieving supra-physiological IDUA expression in dried blood spot samples at 12 months (a primary efficacy endpoint). Associated with this, the results demonstrated increased IDUA expression in the CSF, with reduction of GAGs in CSF and normalization of GAG levels in urine.
 All eight patients treated with OTL-203 showed stable cognitive function, motor function and growth within the normal range at multiple data points post-treatment. For instance, stable cognitive performance, as evaluated by cognitive age-
 12


equivalence using the Bayley scale, was shown in all patients post-treatment, with follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. Longitudinal growth that was within age-appropriate reference ranges was seen in all patients post-treatment, with follow-up ranging from 9 months to 2 years. Furthermore, stable motor function was seen in all patients compared to pre-treatment, with follow-up ranging from 9 months to 1.5 years, and improved range of motion (less joint stiffness) was also shown in all patients compared to pre-treatment, with follow-up ranging from 9 months to 1.5 years.
 We have been granted parallel scientific advice by the FDA and EMA on this program. We intend to seek feedback from the regulatory agencies, including on the study design and CMC development, in advance of initiating an international multi-center registrational study for OTL-203 by year-end 2021, subject to filing an IND in the U.S. and necessary clinical trial applications, or CTAs, in Europe. 
 Gene therapy for treatment of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB 
 Disease overview 
 MPS-IIIA, also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A, and MPS-IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type B, are life-threatening metabolic diseases that cause accumulation of glycosaminoglycan in cells, tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. Within one to two years after birth, MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB patients begin to experience progressive neurodevelopmental decline, including speech delay and eventual loss of language, behavioral disturbances, and potentially severe dementia. Ultimately, most patients with MPS-IIIA progress to a vegetative state. Life expectancy for patients with MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB is between 10 to 25 years and 15 to 30 years, respectively. 
 The incidence of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB are currently estimated to be one in 100,000 and one in 200,000 live births per year, respectively. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Currently, there are no effective treatments or approved therapies for MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB. Palliative care options involve medications for seizures and pain, antibiotics and sedatives, on a case-by-case basis, as well as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and tube feeding or gastrostomy when patients can no longer eat without assistance. Palliative care addresses the symptoms of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB but does not slow or reverse the progression of the underlying disease. Systemic ERT is not an approved treatment option and HSCT is not considered to be an effective treatment option for these diseases. The severity of symptoms and lack of an effective treatment option to manage these symptoms is a significant burden to MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB patients, their caregivers and families and healthcare systems. 
 Our solutions, OTL-201 for treatment of MPS-IIIA and OTL-202 for treatment of MPS-IIIB
We are developing OTL-201 and OTL-202 as ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapies for treatment of patients with MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB, respectively. In both indications we believe preclinical studies in mice have shown that ex vivo autologous gene therapy has the potential to address the neurological manifestations of MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB. We have obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to OTL-201 and OTL-202 from The University of Manchester. 
 OTL-201 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA and FDA for the treatment of MPS-IIIA and has received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA. 
 Proof of concept trial in MPS-IIIA
 We are supporting a proof of concept trial for the treatment of MPS-IIIA, which started enrollment in January 2020. The trial, which is being conducted by the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and sponsored by the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, is expected to enroll up to five patients. As of February 2021, four patients were enrolled in the study and three patients had been treated with OTL-201 in the ongoing proof of concept trial. 
 
Interim results were presented at the WORLDSymposium in February 2021 through an oral presentation.  As of February 2021, these preliminary results from the first three patients treated with OTL-201 showed promising tolerability, engraftment and biomarker data over the initial three-month follow-up period. For instance, the treatment has been generally well-tolerated in the first three patients with no treatment-related SAEs, and all transplant-related SAEs and adverse events have resolved. Data supported evidence of hematological engraftment, as illustrated by the rapid recovery of neutrophils, platelets 
 13


and hemoglobin levels post myeloablative conditioning in all three patients within three months of treatment. Enrollment is planned to be completed and the company intends to release additional interim results in 2021.
 
In terms of biomarker data, SGSH enzyme expression in leukocytes and CD15+ cells increased from undetectable levels at baseline to supra-physiological levels at three months in all three patients treated.  Furthermore, investigators reported a reduction of urinary GAG levels to within the normal range by three months in the first two patients treated with evaluable data.
 Preclinical development of OTL-202 
 
OTL-202 will use the same approach as OTL-201. Lentivirus vector optimization for OTL-202 for treatment of MPS-IIIB is ongoing, and we plan to continue to progress preclinical development of MPS-IIIB. We plan to leverage information gained from OTL-201 preclinical and clinical development to support the OTL-202 program.
 
Research program in FTD 
 Disease overview 
 Frontotemporal Dementia, or FTD, is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer Disease in people under the age of 65. FTD is due to the atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. The disease manifests with progressive changes in behavior and personality, starting with symptoms such as decline in social and personal interactions, depression, apathy, emotional blunting, disinhibition and language disorders, and then progressing to general cognitive impairment at a later stage. In ~5% of patients, FTD is caused by mutations in one copy (haploinsufficiency) of the gene that codes for progranulin, or GRN. GRN is a neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory factor that is produced and secreted among others by specialized cells in the brain called microglia cells. GRN produced by microglia cells can be taken up by neighboring neurons, helping them to be healthy and functional. Since GRN-FTD patients’ cells do not produce enough GRN, brain inflammation develops with time and neurons become progressively dysfunctional until they eventually die, leading to brain atrophy and the aforementioned symptoms. 
 We believe there are currently up to 2,500 people affected by GRN-FTD in Europe/U.S., with approximately 800 new cases per year.
 Limitations of current therapies 
 There are no treatments available for FTD and death occurs six to nine years after onset.
 Our solution, OTL-204 for treatment of FTD
 OTL-204 is an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy being developed to replace the defective microglia cells in the brain of GRN-FTD patients with genetically modified microglia cells that produce and secrete a corrective amount of GRN. These cells develop naturally from HSCs, which are collected from the patient and modified by using a viral vector that brings a functional copy of the GRN gene. When they are infused in the patient, the genetically modified HSCs naturally reach the brain and become resident microglia cells. OTL-204 is being developed in partnership with Professor Alessandra Biffi at the University of Padua in Italy. As part of the collaboration, we initiated a sponsored research agreement with the University of Padua and obtained an exclusive option with Boston Children’s Hospital to develop and exclusively license the program.
 Preclinical development of OTL-204
 In vitro data obtained in 2020 have demonstrated that human cell lines and mouse HSCs can be efficiently transduced to produce GRN. GRN is then secreted in the culture medium and can be taken up by other types of cells that do not produce GRN themselves.
 Preclinical studies in a mouse model of FTD are currently under way, and we plan to announce new preclinical data from this research program in the second half of 2021.

Research program in ALS
 Disease overview 
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the motor neurons. People affected by ALS develop muscular weakness, twitching and atrophy that cause difficulties in speaking, swallowing and eventually breathing. Mutations in many different genes have been linked to ALS and these generally lead to the malfunctioning of neurons and their degeneration, causing a strong inflammation in the brain that further worsen neuronal death. Microglia cells are a type of brain cells that are heavily involved in inflammation and can contribute to neuronal loss by promoting oxidative stress. In particular, the Nox2 gene expressed by microglia cells induces the production of reactive oxygen radical species, which cause oxidative stress, damage to molecules and inflammation. It is important to note that ALS patients who have lower levels of Nox2 have a much better survival.
 The incidence of ALS is currently estimated at 2.1 to 3.8 per 100,000 live births in the EU and UK and 1.0 to 2.6 per 100,000 live births in the U.S., for a total of up to 12,000 to 15,000 new patients per year.
 Limitations of current therapies 
 There is no effective treatment for ALS and the average survival is between two and four years from the onset of symptoms. 
 Our solution, OTL-205 for treatment of ALS
 OTL-205 is an ex vivo autologous gene therapy being developed to genetically modify microglia cells so that they have a much lower level of Nox2 and therefore produce less oxidative stress and less local inflammation. Microglia cells can be derived from HSCs. In our approach, HSCs are extracted from the patient, modified in the laboratory with the lentiviral vector and then infused back into the patient. These modified HSCs then migrate into the brain, where they become microglia cells replacing the diseased cells and reducing inflammation. This approach has the potential to improve symptoms and prolong survival in all ALS patients irrespective of their genetic mutations. OTL-205 is being developed in partnership with Professor Alessandra Biffi at the University of Padua in Italy. As part of the collaboration, we initiated a sponsored research agreement with the University of Padua and obtained an exclusive option with Boston Children’s Hospital to develop and exclusively license the program.
 Preclinical development of OTL-205
 Preliminary in vitro data have shown that reducing Nox2 levels by RNA interference in microglia cells efficiently reduces the inflammatory response in these cells and the production of oxygen radicals.
 We plan to continue to progress in vitro and in vivo characterization of this therapeutic approach in relevant ALS mouse models.
 Immunological Disorders 
 Gene therapy for treatment of WAS 
 Disease overview 
 WAS is a rare, life-threatening inherited disease affecting the patient’s immune system and platelets leading to recurrent, severe infections and uncontrollable bleeds, which are the leading causes of death in the disease. WAS is referred to as an “X-linked-recessive” disease as it is associated with a genetic defect on the X chromosome. Because it is an X-linked disease, it affects mainly males. Patients with WAS are born with a defect in the gene that produces the WAS protein, or WASP. As a result, they suffer from life-threatening thrombocytopenia and are at risk of severe bleeds, infections, autoimmunity, malignancies and severe eczema. These symptoms require increasingly frequent hospitalizations. The median survival for a patient with WAS without curative intervention is approximately 15 years. Patients with early onset WAS generally have a shorter life expectancy. 
 The incidence of WAS is currently estimated at approximately 0.4 in 100,000 live male births. 
 15


Limitations of current therapies 
 Treatment options for WAS include prophylactic anti-infective medicines, which are not always effective in preventing severe infections requiring antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and intravenous immunoglobulin, as well as chronic platelet transfusions to prevent severe bleeding. WAS patients are often prescribed chronic oral medications or topical steroids and may require admission to hospital for intravenous antibiotic treatment. HSCT is an alternative treatment option for some patients for whom a sufficiently well-matched donor is identified. Although HSCT is potentially curative in patients with WAS, this approach can be associated with significant risks, especially when matched cell donors are not available. Approximately 75% of WAS patients treated with HSCT experience serious complications, such as severe infections requiring hospitalization, autoimmune manifestations, and GvHD within the first year of receiving the treatment. The risk of HSCT-related complications is greater in certain patients, including those that have had a previous splenectomy or are over five years old.
 Our solution, OTL-103 for treatment of WAS 
 We are developing OTL-103 as an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy to treat patients with WAS through a single administration. OTL-103 is manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s peripheral blood or bone marrow that are modified to add a functional WASP gene using a lentiviral vector. The autologous genetically modified cells are infused back into the patient in a single intravenous infusion following treatment with a conditioning regimen that is similar to that used in an allogeneic HSCT. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to this program through the GSK Agreement in 2018. 
 OTL-103 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of WAS. OTL-103 has also received a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. RMAT designation was granted in 2019. 
 Clinical program 
 Eight patients have been treated with OTL-103 in an ongoing fresh formulation registrational trial at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, and nine patients in an expanded access program, or EAP, at the same site, with a follow-up of up to approximately 10 years post-treatment for the first patient treated.  In addition, a phase 3, open-label, single arm clinical trial using the intended commercial cryopreserved formulation of OTL-103 was initiated in 2019 and has recruited and treated six patients as of January 2020. All patients have reached a minimum of 12-months follow-up. The co-primary endpoints of the study using the cryopreserved formulation include bleeding (0 to 12 months post-gene therapy) and infections (6 to 18 months post-gene therapy) compared with rates pre-gene therapy.
 The primary goals of the registrational clinical trial are to assess the efficacy and safety of OTL-103 in WAS patients, as measured by, for example, improved T-cell function, improved platelet count and overall survival at 36 months after treatment. Other goals of this clinical trial include reduced bleeding episodes and reduced frequency of severe infections. The primary analysis for the registrational clinical trial was prospectively defined to be when all patients have completed at least 3 years’ follow-up, which was achieved in 2017.
 The first interim analysis was generated in 2017, when 6 of the 8 subjects had completed at least 3 years follow up. The results of an interim analysis of this clinical trial were published in 2019 in Lancet Haematology and showed that WASP expression in lymphocytes and platelets was substantially improved compared to baseline by six months and remain constant thereafter. At one-year post-treatment with OTL-103, T-cell counts increased in seven evaluable patients, as compared to counts prior to treatment, reaching normal values. Because of the increase in T-cells, a reduction in infections was observed in patient's post-treatment compared to one year prior to treatment with OTL-103. 
 Mean platelet counts before treatment were low compared to normal, with a range of 6 x 109 to 25 x 109 per liter observed in eight patients. Platelet counts progressively improved in all patients. One-year post-treatment platelet counts increased in all patients to a range of 21 x 109  to 74 x 109 per liter, and further increases in platelet count were observed in six patients to a range of 27 x 109 to 169 x 109 per liter at three years post-treatment. In addition to the increase in platelet count, increased and sustained platelet volume in seven patients was also observed at three years post-treatment. These increases in platelet count and volume resulted in reduced frequency and severity of bleeding events as compared to those experienced by these patients prior to treatment with OTL-103.
 16


An EAP was put in place after the study completed enrollment. The objective of this EAP was to provide treatment for patients affected by WAS with high unmet medical need in advance of the product being commercially available.
A second interim analysis of patients in the registrational clinical trial and EAP was done in March 2019. As reported at ASH 2019, in patients with at least one year of follow-up in the program (n=14), the absence of severe bleeding events and independence from platelet transfusions were observed in all subjects by 9 months of follow-up. Additionally, a reduction in severe infection rate was observed at multiple time points post-treatment.

Cumulatively, as of January 2021, a total of 23 subjects from clinical trials and an EAP have been treated with OTL-103. Seventeen of the subjects – eight from clinical trials and nine from the EAP – have been treated with the fresh formulation of OTL-103, and six subjects have been treated with the cryopreserved formulation of OTL-103. 
 
From these two trials and the EAP, 18 SAEs were reported in a total of seven subjects during the reporting period. Nine of the 18 events occurred pre-gene therapy in the cryopreserved study of OTL-103. None of these SAEs were considered to be related to OTL-103, no antibodies against WASP were detected, and no allergic reactions related to OTL-103 have been reported in subjects treated with OTL-103. As of December 2020, no new safety information has changed the known safety profile of OTL-103.
 
Regulatory pathway for OTL-103
 An IND for OTL-103 was opened in the U.S. in 2019, and an RMAT multi-disciplinary meeting was held with FDA in 2020.  The meeting was intended to discuss the development program completed to date and the path to a BLA filing in the U.S. for OTL-103. Based on feedback received during that meeting, we are currently working to compile the remaining data to support a BLA filing including additional clinical data, CMC comparability data and development of a specific functional potency assay requested by the FDA. 
 In 2020, we also received scientific advice from EMA to clarify the filing strategy and data required to file an MAA in the EU.  We plan to continue engaging with the FDA and EMA in 2021 concerning the manufacturing and clinical development of OTL-103. 
 We plan to submit an MAA with the EMA and a BLA with the FDA for OTL-103 for the treatment of WAS in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
 We currently expect that our MAA and BLA submissions will be supported by a data package, including an adequate potency assay and clinical data from our trial with eight patients treated with the fresh formulation of OTL-103 and data from the second clinical trial using the intended commercial cryopreserved formulation as well as data collected from nine additional patients treated with OTL-103 under an EAP. We intend to seek approval of OTL-103 using mobilized peripheral blood as the cellular source and a cryopreserved product formulation.

Gene therapy for treatment of ADA-SCID 
 Disease overview 
 Severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID, is a rare, life-threatening inherited disease of the immune system. ADA-SCID is a specific form of SCID, commonly known as “bubble-baby disease,” caused by mutations in the ADA gene, resulting in a lack of, or minimal, immune system development, which leaves the patient vulnerable to severe and recurrent bacterial, viral and fungal infections. 
 The prevalence of ADA-SCID in the United States is currently estimated to be between one in 200,000 and the incidence is estimated at one in 1 million live births. Higher prevalence and incidence rates are reported in geographies of higher consanguinity, such as Turkey and the Middle East. 
 Patients with ADA-SCID are most commonly diagnosed during the first six months of life based on recurrent bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, persistent lymphopenia, and ADA activity below 1%. Newborn screening for T-cell deficiencies, including ADA-SCID, has now been adopted in all 50 states in the United States, as well as in other jurisdictions, including several Canadian provinces, Israel, Taiwan, Germany, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 The primary treatment options for ADA-SCID are HSCT and enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT. Although HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for ADA-SCID patients, this procedure is associated with a high risk of complications and mortality, with one-year survival rates of 43%, 67% and 86% for transplants from haploidentical donors, human leukocyte antigen, or HLA,-matched unrelated donors and HLA-matched sibling donors, respectively. 
 Chronic ERT is a palliative treatment for ADA-SCID patients and involves weekly or bi-weekly intra-muscular infusions. ERT with pegylated adenosine deaminase has been approved by the FDA and is commercialized in the United States. It is only available on a named patient use basis in Europe. Although ERT can temporarily restore immune function by maintaining high ADA levels in the plasma, many patients receiving chronic ERT therapy continue to have abnormally low levels of lymphocytes in the blood after the first year of treatment, and 50% of patients therefore require supplementary immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Chronic ERT has been associated with a 78% survival rate at 20 years; however, significant morbidity or mortality may occur as early as one to three years after the first treatment. 
 Our solutions, OTL-101 and Strimvelis for treatment of ADA-SCID 
 Strimvelis is the only gammaretroviral vector mediated autologous HSC gene therapy in our portfolio. Each of our other pipeline therapies, including OTL-101 for ADA-SCID and OTL-200 for MLD, employ a self-inactivating, or SIN, lentiviral vector-based approach that has been specifically designed to minimize the risk of insertional oncogenesis after administration. No evidence of insertional oncogenesis related to lentiviral vector-based HSC gene therapy has been reported in any of our programs.
 Strimvelis
 In Europe, our commercial program Strimvelis, an ex vivo gammaretrovirus mediated autologous HSC gene therapy, is the only approved gene therapy option for patients with ADA-SCID.  The EMA approved Strimvelis in May 2016 for treatment of children with ADA-SCID with no suitable HLA-matched related stem cell donor. Strimvelis consists of HSCs transduced with a gammaretroviral vector encoding the human adenosine deaminase cDNA sequence. Strimvelis is available at a single site in a fresh product formulation at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, and has a shelf-life of up to six hours. 
 Summary of the safety profile of Strimvelis
 In October 2020, one case of lymphoid T cell leukemia was reported in a patient approximately five years after such patient was treated with Strimvelis as part of a compassionate use program. We notified the EMA and the relevant local European regulatory authorities of an emerging safety issue and paused treating new patients with Strimvelis pending the completion of the causality investigation. Subsequent findings confirmed that the patient’s leukemia was due to insertional oncogenesis attributable to treatment with Strimvelis. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, reviewed the updated risk-benefit assessment of Strimvelis as part of its ongoing MAA renewal procedure, concluded that the risk-benefit balance remains favorable and recommended in February 2021 that the marketing authorization for Strimvelis be renewed for five years, allowing marketing of Strimvelis to resume. 
 18


As of November 2020, the safety of Strimvelis was evaluated in 40 patients – 22 patients who were treated in the clinical development program, 16 patients treated in the commercial setting, and 2 patients treated with a medicinal product prepared from mobilized peripheral blood under hospital exemption – with a maximum follow-up of 19 years. The reported adverse reactions are in line with the expected safety profile of Strimvelis and the conditioning regime administered prior to treatment with the product. The most commonly reported adverse reaction was pyrexia.  For complete safety details, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, for Strimvelis, available at the EMA website.
OTL-101 for treatment of ADA-SCID
 We are developing OTL-101 as an ex vivo autologous lentiviral vector-based HSC gene therapy to treat patients with ADA-SCID through a single administration. 
 OTL-101 has been investigated in multiple clinical trials in the United States and Europe. As of January 2021, 67 patients have been treated with a drug product manufactured with the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector, with a maximum follow-up of approximately nine years post treatment. Our program comprises a registrational trial conducted at University of California Los Angeles, or UCLA, of 20 patients treated with a fresh product formulation of OTL-101, supportive data derived from a clinical trial of 10 patients treated with a cryopreserved formulation at UCLA and additional data derived from a clinical trial of 10 patients treated with a fresh product formulation at Great Ormond Street Hospital, or GOSH.  The remaining 27 patients treated as of January 2021 represent compassionate use patients or patients for whom we do not have adequate follow-up as of the date of this Annual Report but for which safety data is presented in the summary below. Among the 67 patients treated, four patients, including those treated under compassionate use and additional supportive studies, did not engraft or had to resume ERT and/or receive rescue bone marrow transplant.
 We obtained worldwide rights to the OTL-101 program through our UCLB/UCLA license agreement and we obtained worldwide rights to the Strimvelis program through our asset purchase and license agreement with Glaxo Group Limited and GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development LTD, or, together, GSK. 
 OTL-101 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of ADA-SCID and Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. OTL-101 has also received a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA. 
 Registrational trial conducted by UCLA (“UCLA Fresh study”)
 Production of the fresh OTL-101 drug product formulation (with bone marrow as the cellular source) used in this clinical trial was performed onsite at UCLA and at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for one patient. In this clinical trial, all 20 enrolled and treated patients were treated with ERT prior to enrollment and continued ERT until 30 days following their treatment with OTL-101. Two years follow-up was completed for all patients in August 2018.
 The primary goals of this clinical trial were to assess the safety and efficacy of OTL-101 in ADA-SCID patients, as measured by overall survival and event-free survival at 12 months post-treatment. Secondary goals in this clinical trial included immune reconstitution, as measured by lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels, and reduction in severe infection rates. 
 Overall survival and event-free survival of 100% was observed at 12 months post-treatment, the primary endpoint of the trial. None of the enrolled patients required rescue medication, HSCT, or resumption of ERT. 
 When comparing the overall survival for the OTL-101 treated patients with a historical control group who received allogeneic bone marrow transplant, or HSCT, between 2000 and 2016 (n=26), OTL-101 treated patients achieved a higher overall survival rate at 24 months (100%) versus the group that received allogeneic bone marrow transplant (88%) 
 Event-free survival is defined as survival without resumption of PEG-ADA ERT or need for rescue allogeneic HSCT. Event-free survival in the OTL-101 treatment group was 100% at 24 months. In comparison, event-free survival in the allogeneic HSCT group was 56%. 
 Importantly, patients in this trial showed immune cell reconstitution following treatment with OTL-101, which can lead to restoration of both cellular and humoral immune responses. As of the final study report, the severe infection rates across the full post treatment period were lower in the OTL-101 treatment group compared with the HSCT control group. Additionally, by 24 months post-treatment, a considerably higher proportion of subjects in the OTL-101 treatment group (90%) had stopped immunoglobulin replacement therapy compared with HSCT controls (55%).

Supportive clinical trial with UCLA (with cryopreserved formulation) (“UCLA Cryo study”)
 A cryopreserved formulation of OTL-101 (with bone marrow as cellular source) has been evaluated in a supportive clinical trial at UCLA. Enrollment for this trial is complete and of 10 patients treated, 9 completed their final 24-month study visit as of September 2019. One patient treated in this trial, who did not engraft, restarted ERT, was withdrawn from the trial, and later received a rescue HSCT. The aim of this clinical trial was to provide clinical data supportive of the analytical chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC, comparison of the fresh and cryopreserved drug product formulations. As of February 2019, when 7 patients had reached 18 months of follow-up, key biological parameters of engraftment and efficacy (including medians of VCN in granulocytes and CD3+ T lymphocyte counts and ADA enzyme activity) were consistent when compared across the UCLA Fresh and UCLA Cryo studies and remained consistent throughout follow-up.
 We believe this consistency between the UCLA Fresh and UCLA Cryo studies is supportive of analytical comparability data between the fresh and cryopreserved formulations of OTL-101. 
 Additional clinical data from GOSH 
 In a parallel investigator-sponsored trial conducted by GOSH, ten enrolled patients have been treated with fresh product formulation (with bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood as the cellular source). The drug product used in this clinical trial was produced using the same vector as at UCLA, but with a manufacturing process with minor differences to that for OTL-101. Production of the fresh formulation of the drug product used in this clinical trial was performed onsite at GOSH. In this clinical trial, all patients were being treated with ERT prior to enrollment and all but one patient continued ERT until 30 days following initial treatment with ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy.
 The primary goals of this clinical trial were to assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product in ADA-SCID patients, as measured by overall survival and event-free survival at 12 months post-treatment. Secondary goals in this clinical trial included immune reconstitution, as measured by lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels, and reduction in severe infection rates. 
 As of August 2020, overall survival of 100% has been observed at 36 months post treatment in the 10 patients enrolled, and nine patients have achieved event-free survival, with only one patient resuming ERT after 12.2 months due to a failure to engraft. We believe this failure to engraft may, in part, be attributable to the patient’s early discontinuation of ERT prior to treatment in contravention of the trial protocol, but may also relate to other clinical factors.
 There is a second investigator-sponsored trial being conducted by GOSH, which has now enrolled and treated 10 patients with the cryopreserved product formulation from mobilized peripheral blood. The drug product used in this clinical trial is produced using the same vector and same manufacturing process as the drug product being evaluated at UCLA. Production of the cryopreserved formulation of the drug product used in this clinical trial is performed onsite at GOSH. In this clinical trial, all patients are being treated with ERT prior to enrollment and continue ERT until 30 days following initial treatment with ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy. 
 The primary goals of this clinical trial are to assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug product in ADA-SCID patients, as measured by overall survival and event-free survival at 12 months post-treatment. Secondary goals in this clinical trial include immune reconstitution, as measured by lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels, and reduction in severe infection rates. As of January 2021, all ten patients are alive and no longer being treated with ERT. 
 OTL-101 clinical program safety 
 As of January 2021, there have been 41 SAEs reported from 16 out of 33 subjects exposed to OTL-101 in the EAP and UCLA Fresh and UCLA Cryo studies. Based on the safety data collected in the OTL-101 clinical development, expanded access and compassionate use programs, OTL-101 has so far demonstrated a favorable safety profile. 
 A global observational long-term follow-up study is now open. This study is designed to collect long team safety and efficacy data from ADA-SCID patients previously treated with autologous ex vivo gene therapy products based on the EFS-ADA lentiviral vector up to 15 years post gene therapy in compliance with current regulatory requirements. 
 We have completed final clinical study reports for our registrational trial using OTL-101 fresh formulation and the second clinical trial using OTL-101 cryopreserved formulation, which we believe supports the analytical comparability data between fresh and cryopreserved drug product formulations.

Gene therapy for treatment of X-CGD 
 Disease overview 
 X-CGD is a rare, life-threatening inherited disease of the immune system. X-CGD is an X-linked-recessive disease and therefore affects males. Because of the underlying genetic defect in the cytochrome B-245 beta chain, or CYBB, gene in patients with X-CGD, the patient’s white blood cells, specifically neutrophils/granulocytes, are unable to kill bacteria and fungi, leading to repeated chronic infections. The main clinical manifestations of X-CGD are pyoderma; pneumonia; colitis; lymphadenitis; brain, lung and liver abscesses; and osteomyelitis. Granuloma formation can also occur as a result of persistent inflammatory response to the pathogens and can result in recurrent obstructions of the gastro-intestinal and urinary tract. Patients with X-CGD typically start to develop infections in the first decade of life. Mortality in X-CGD has been estimated at approximately 40% by the age of 35 years. 
 The incidence of X-CGD is currently estimated to be one in 200,000 male live births. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Current treatment options for X-CGD include prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal medications and interferon-gamma, which are not always effective in preventing severe infections. Although HSCT is potentially curative in patients with X-CGD, this approach can be associated with significant risks, especially when well-matched cell donors are not available. 
 Our solution, OTL-102 for treatment of X-CGD 
 We are developing OTL-102 as an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy to treat patients with X-CGD through a single administration. OTL-102 is manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s own mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow, then modified to add a functional CYBB gene using a lentiviral vector. The gene-modified cells are infused back into the patient in a single intravenous infusion following treatment with a myeloablative conditioning regimen. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to the OTL-102 program through an option and license agreement with Généthon, pursuant to which we have exercised an option to certain intellectual property and clinical data associated with clinical trials at sites in the United States and the United Kingdom.
 OTL-102 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA and FDA for the treatment of X-CGD. 
 Ongoing clinical trials
 OTL-102, which has been studied in two investigator-sponsored proof of concept clinical trials in the United States and in Europe, with target enrollment of 10 patients in a clinical trial sponsored by UCLA in the United States and an initial target enrollment of five patients in a clinical trial conducted by GOSH in Europe. The clinical trial sites included Boston Children’s Hospital, the NIH, and UCLA in the United States, and GOSH and The Royal Free Hospital in London. Patients enrolled in these trials have advanced and severe stages of X-CGD. Manufacture of the drug product occurred at each of these sites using the same vector. As of January 2021, nine patients had been treated in the clinical trial in the United States, five of which were treated with a fresh product formulation and four of which were treated with a cryopreserved formulation. Further, three patients had been treated in the clinical trial in Europe, and one patient was treated in a compassionate use program in Europe with a cryopreserved product formulation. In the future, we may treat additional pediatric patients in this trial with a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-102. 
 OTL-102 has shown sustained CYBB expression for over two years in six patients to date, with a follow-up of three years post-treatment in patients as of January 2021.
 21


In these clinical trials, the production of NADPH-oxidase activity in neutrophils, a biomarker that demonstrates restored granulocyte function, has been measured in patients for up to 24 months post-treatment. In a November 2019 publication in Nature Medicine, combined data from nine patients, including initial enrollees in both clinical trials and a compassionate use patient, showed NADPH-oxidase activity, as measured by dihydrorhodamine, or DHR, assay, above 10% in six patients with at least 24 months follow-up. Based on the scientific literature, levels of NADPH-oxidase activity above 10% was a clinically meaningful percentage for fighting infections successfully. One pediatric patient showed initial engraftment of DHR+ cells followed by a decrease to levels of 1% or less. The graphic below illustrates sustained NADPH-oxidase levels, as measured for up to 24 months post-treatment. 
 OTL-102 (X-CGD): NADPH-oxidase activity(1)

(1) Excludes data from one patient treated with drug product deemed by the investigator to be a different form of OTL-102 drug product. 
 Since September 2018, four additional patients have been treated as part of the clinical trials, with one adult patient having sustained DHR+ neutrophils of 77.2% at 6 months and three pediatric patients displaying a similar response to the pediatric patient that did not respond to therapy. These observations specific to the pediatric patients were investigated and amendments to the clinical protocols were made in 2020 to modify the conditioning regimen used in studies with the aim of improving engraftment.  Factors that are considered important to address are the chronic inflammatory environment of the bone marrow in CGD patients, the potential for B and T cell immune responses, either as a result of the disease background or as newly generated due to the ‘novel’ expression of gp91phox and the quality of the drug product which may be influenced by the quality of the collected cells. Investigators plan to begin enrolling additional pediatric patients (n=6) in 2021 and 2022 to access outcomes in the specific patient's population. The primary goals of this extension clinical trial are to assess safety and efficacy, as measured by biochemical and functional reconstitution through increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase, or NADPH oxidase, activity in progeny of engrafted cells and stability at 12 months post-treatment. Following institutional review board, or IRB, approvals, enrollment can commence. We intend to follow these pediatric patients in the proof of concept study and then progress OTL-102 into a registrational study.
 Two patients treated with OTL-102 as part of the clinical trials died during the three months period following treatment as a result of pre-existing disease-related complications present at the time of treatment with OTL-102. One of these patients (from the UK trial) died of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This subject had a pre-existing lung condition. The other patient (from the U.S. trial) developed platelet antibodies due to sensitization after several granulocyte infusions the patient received prior to gene therapy. The learnings from this patient resulted in a protocol amendment to prevent patients with existing platelet antibodies from enrolling in the trial. Neither of these two fatalities was deemed by the investigator to be 
 22


related to the therapy. A third fatality was reported involving a patient treated under the compassionate use program at GOSH. Because of this patient’s advanced disease stage at the time of enrollment, the patient required a surgical procedure following treatment and died as a result of complications from this procedure. This fatality was deemed by the investigator not to be related to the product. 
 Safety
 As of March 2020, the date of the most recent safety data available to us, patients treated in this clinical trial indicate OTL-102 was generally well-tolerated. There were 26 serious adverse events reported, one of which was assessed by the investigator as being possibly related to OTL-102 and was reported as Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). As of December 2020, no new safety information received by us has changed the known safety profile of OTL-102. 
 Research program in NOD2-Crohn’s Disease 
 Disease overview 
 Crohn’s Disease, or CD, is a form of Irritable Bowel Disease, or IBD, a condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract caused by an uncontrolled and chronic inflammatory process directed against intestinal bacteria. Mutations in a number of genes are known to confer susceptibility to the risk of CD, and amongst these the NOD2 gene (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2) is known to be the most common genetic factor, with 20-40% of Crohn’s patients carrying mutations causing defective NOD2 activity.  NOD2 encodes a cell receptor which controls bacterial elimination by innate immune cells such as macrophages through recognition of bacterial peptide (MDP) and induction of a pro-inflammatory immune response. NOD2 deficiency results in an impaired detection and clearance of bacteria penetrating the gut during gastrointestinal infection, creating an unchecked and relapsing inflammation within the intestinal tissues characterized by intestinal granuloma formation. This leads to recurrent clinical symptoms of chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, malnutrition and for some patients, more severe intestinal damage requiring surgical resection. NOD2-CD patients typically present with more severe symptoms and are reported to be more refractory to existing therapies.
 The incidence of CD is high compared to our other indications, with estimates of 100 to 200 patients per million in Europe and North America.  Epidemiological studies suggest NOD2 genetic variants causing functional defects are associated with 7 to 10% of all cases of CD, with up to 200,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with two NOD2 mutated alleles.
 Limitations of current therapies 
 Current clinical management for Crohn’s disease includes use of immune-suppressive medications, biological agents such as anti-TNF, steroids and surgical resection. There is currently no cure for Crohn's disease, and long-term, effective treatment options are limited. Several clinical trials have evaluated autologous HSCT in Crohn’s disease, although with limited success. There remains a need for therapeutic modalities that target underlying causes of Crohn’s disease to achieve effective amelioration of symptoms and disease remission.
 Our solution, OTL-104 for treatment of NOD2-CD
 We are developing OTL-104 to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy as an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy to treat patients with NOD2-CD through a single administration. As the pathogenesis of NOD2-CD is associated with the function of cells of the hematopoietic system, ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy may therefore be used restore NOD2 function to immune cells such as tissue resident macrophages within the gastrointestinal tract. Our OTL-104 program is being designed to introduce the NOD2 gene into cells of the hematopoietic system by lentiviral transduction of a patient’s own blood or bone marrow derived HSCs, and the gene-modified cells can then be infused back into the patient. We own pending patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions and all other intellectual property rights associated with the OTL-104 program. 
 Preclinical development of OTL-104
 OTL-104 preclinical work completed to date has shown that NOD2 defective human and NOD2 deficient murine macrophages and monocytes are refractory to bacterial MDP stimulation. We have demonstrated the successful restoration of NOD2 expression and functional correction of macrophage cellular responses to bacterial MDP stimulation, in NOD2 
 23


defective human cells and NOD2 deficient murine cells, achieved through lentiviral gene transfer of NOD2 to human CD34+ HSC and murine lineage negative cells, respectively. 
 We plan to continue to progress our preclinical proof of concept studies using an experimental mouse model of NOD2 deficiency to evaluate the use of gene modified HSC-derived cells to replace intestinal gut resident macrophages (monocyte-derived) and to correct inflammation and colitis associated with NOD2-CD. We plan to announce new preclinical data from this research program in the second half of 2021.
 Blood disorders
 Gene therapy for treatment of TDT 
 Disease overview 
 Beta-thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused by one of over 200 mutations in the hemoglobin beta, or HBB, gene. Patients with beta-thalassemia have low levels of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body. TDT is the most severe form of beta-thalassemia and requires patients to receive eight or more blood transfusions per year, with the number of transfusions dependent upon the severity of the patient’s disease. Symptoms in TDT patients appear within the first two years of life and include failure to thrive, persistent infections and life-threatening anemia. Patients with TDT also suffer from other symptoms such as liver and spleen enlargement, bone deformities and osteopenia, and hypermetabolic state, resulting in chronic malnourishment. In the absence of regular blood transfusions, TDT is usually fatal in infancy. 
 TDT is one of the most common genetic diseases, with a global incidence estimated at approximately 25,000 symptomatic individuals born each year. 
 Limitations of current therapies 
 The symptoms experienced by most patients with TDT are severe and often require frequent, life-long blood transfusions to replenish the patient’s hemoglobin level. Because iron cannot be excreted by the body, these frequent blood transfusions can cause iron to accumulate in various organs, leading to risk of heart or liver failure. Therefore, patients who receive ongoing blood transfusions must also receive iron chelation therapy to remove the excess iron. These medicines also have side effects and can negatively impact a patient’s quality of life. Although HSCT is potentially curative in patients with TDT, this approach can be associated with significant risks, especially when matched stem cell donors are not available. 
 Our solution, OTL-300 for treatment of TDT 
 OTL-300 is an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy, manufactured from HSCs isolated from the patient’s own mobilized peripheral blood, then modified to add a functional HBB gene using a lentiviral vector. OTL-300 is designed to significantly reduce or eliminate the need for blood transfusions in patients with TDT. 
 We obtained worldwide rights to this program through the GSK Agreement. OTL-300 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA for the treatment of beta-thalassemia major and intermedia. In addition, OTL-300 has received PRIME designation from the EMA.
 In May 2020, we announced that we would be reducing our investment in the future development of OTL-300.
 Proof of concept trial (cryopreserved formulation) 
 OTL-300 has been investigated in an academic-sponsored clinical trial at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy to establish proof of concept. The study and clinical follow-up completed in November 2019.  Nine patients with severe TDT received a single intra-osseous infusion of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-300 and were followed up for 2 years. The patients evaluated in this trial included six pediatric patients aged three to 17 years, and three adult patients aged 18 years and over. On completion of the study, all patients enrolled in an Orchard-sponsored long-term follow-up clinical trial, which will continue assessments for an additional six-year period. 
 24


The primary goals of the clinical trial were to assess the safety and efficacy of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-300 in TDT patients, as measured by, for example, reduction in required blood transfusions to manage the patients’ TDT and overall survival at 24 months post-treatment. 
 All patients have completed the 24-month study follow-up period. Transfusion independence or significant reductions in transfusion frequency and volume requirements were observed in six patients, with four of the six pediatric patients being transfusion-free since approximately one-month post-treatment. Following treatment, substantial reductions (in excess of 50%) in transfusion volume requirements were observed over a period of at least 3 years in two out of three adult patients, one of whom had a 9-month transfusion-free period during the first-year post-treatment.
 As of July 2020, OTL-300 was generally well-tolerated. Six SAEs were reported in four subjects out of nine patients treated, and each such SAE was assessed as not related to treatment with OTL-300.  None of these SAEs were fatal, and all events resolved. As of December 2020, no new safety information received has changed the safety profile of OTL-300. 
 Future applications of our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach 
 We believe that our versatile ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach has the potential to deliver promising gene therapies to patients across a broad range of diseases. Although our initial focus is on delivering our commercial and clinical-stage gene therapies to patients suffering from several rare diseases described above, we believe we can leverage our significant research and development experience and partnerships with academic institutions to identify other diseases in our target areas, including neurodegenerative, immunological, and blood disorders, where ex vivo gene therapy may have a comparably higher probability of success as compared to other approaches. In 2020, we introduced new programs in larger indications and our mid- to long-term strategy is to leverage our HSC gene therapy approach in additional larger indications, either on our own or with partners. We are building research capabilities to continue to explore additional indications in our laboratories.
 Our regulatory strategy 
 The nature of our autologous gene therapy product candidates precludes the conduct of Phase 1 safety studies in healthy volunteers. Moreover, considering the indications our product candidates are intended to treat, which are often fatal without treatment and which are rare indications with high unmet medical need, we believe our clinical programs will generally be eligible to proceed to registration based on a single pivotal study given the bioethical considerations regarding the conduct of randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials with gene therapies for such indications. Both the FDA and EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of drug product candidates for the treatment of rare diseases, particularly life-threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such drug product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following one or more clinical trials in a limited patient population, following review of the trial’s design, endpoints and clinical data by the applicable regulatory agencies. These determinations are based on the applicable regulatory agency’s scientific judgement and these determinations may differ in the United States and the European Union. 
 In some cases applicable regulatory agency may require us to perform analytical studies or conduct additional clinical trials to support analytical comparability of drug product, for example by demonstrating comparability of drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from a patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from a patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability of drug product that has been cryopreserved and fresh drug product. For purposes of this Annual Report we refer to these clinical trials as supportive clinical trials. In addition, certain of our product candidates may be evaluated in clinical trials for which clinical data is not intended to be pooled with data from our registrational trials for purposes of a regulatory submission, but will be submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies for informational purposes. For purposes of this Annual Report we refer to these trials as additional clinical trials. In addition, in some cases patients may be ineligible for participation in our clinical trials and may receive treatment under a compassionate use program or an expanded access program. We expect that the available safety and efficacy results from all these trials would be included in any regulatory submission we may submit, and the applicable regulatory agency with respect to each clinical program will make a determination as to whether the available data is sufficient to support a regulatory submission. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—“The results from our clinical trials for OTL-200 for MLD, OTL-103 for WAS, and for any of our other product candidates may not be sufficiently robust to support marketing approval or the submission of marketing approval,” “We may be unable to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability between drug product that has been cryopreserved and fresh drug product and/or demonstrate comparability between the manufacturing process used at academic centers with the manufacturing 
 25


process used at CDMOs,” and “To date, most of the clinical trials for our product candidates were conducted as investigator-sponsored clinical trials using drug product manufactured at academic sites.” 
 Manufacturing 
 The diseases we are targeting affect patients across the world. Therefore, we are implementing our plans to enhance our partnerships with CDMOs and leverage technologies that will allow us to deliver our gene therapies globally. 
 Global supply network with experienced CDMOs 
 We currently partner with a network of experienced CDMOs, including AGC Biologics S.p.A. (formerly MolMed S.p.A.) and Oxford BioMedica, for the supply of our vectors and/or drug products, including Libmeldy. We have established relationships with commercial CDMO partners with the resources and capacity to meet our clinical and existing and expected initial commercial needs. Our CDMO partners also provide us with access to their state-of-the art manufacturing technologies. 
 Manufacturing efficiencies and scalability 
 We are investing in human capital and advancing manufacturing technologies for HSC-based autologous ex vivo gene therapies. We have licensed lentiviral vector stable cell line technologies from GSK, completed transduction enhancer screening processes, established a vector process development lab at a Catapult Network facility in the UK, and are in the process of building cell therapy and analytical development capabilities at our London, UK global headquarters.  We seek to enhance our product and process understanding while actively exploring and developing innovative technologies for vector and drug product manufacturing to improve the efficiency and scalability of manufacturing processes with an ultimate goal to reliably manufacture high quality products for rare diseases and larger indications at lower cost. For example, we have identified and validated several transduction enhancing compounds in order to facilitate lentiviral vector entry into HSCs, showing a greater than 50% reduction in vector requirements. We continue to invest in our people to support the commercialization and lifecycle management of our pipeline products. 
 Cryopreservation of our gene therapy programs 
 Cryopreservation of gene-modified cells is a key component of our strategy to deliver innovative, potentially curative gene therapies to patients worldwide. We have developed cryopreserved formulations of our OTL-200, OTL-103, and OTL-101 programs and expect to demonstrate comparability of our cryopreserved formulations to earlier manufactured fresh formulations in support of future submissions for marketing approval in the United States and Europe. Our programs in OTL-102, OTL-300, OTL-203 and OTL-201 have already started or will start with cryopreserved formulations. We plan to establish cryopreserved product formulations as the standard for all of our future gene therapy candidates. 
 In the cryopreservation process, a patient’s gene-modified HSCs are frozen at extremely low temperatures and then stored to allow quality control testing and release to be performed before introducing the gene-modified cells back into the patient. Our cryopreserved formulations are expected to have shelf-lives of months to years, enabling us to potentially distribute our products and product candidates from a few centralized manufacturing facilities to geographically dispersed treatment sites. Our ability to ultimately distribute our product candidates globally will facilitate access of the therapies to patients and reduce the logistical burden on patients and their families. 
 Commercial operations
 Following our receipt of full, or standard, marketing approval from the European Commission for Libmeldy (OTL-200) for the treatment of early-onset MLD, we expect to launch Libmeldy in Europe and generate product sales as early as the first half of 2021. In preparation for a European launch, we have substantially completed our build-out of our commercial operations in Europe with a goal of delivering Libmeldy to patients through qualified treatment centers in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands. In addition, we expect to leverage cross-border and treatment abroad reimbursement pathways in both Europe and markets such as the Middle East and Turkey through the use of third-party strategic partners and distributors. Subject to approval of OTL-200 from the FDA, we plan to also put in place commercial operations and quality treatment centers in the U.S. We have begun a phased build of commercial capabilities by adding employees with broad experience in quality assurance and compliance, medical education, marketing, supply chain, sales, public policy, patient services, market access and product reimbursement. We expect to continue expansion of these capabilities throughout 2021 and beyond as we continue to implement appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as internal systems and infrastructure in order to support our supply chain, qualify and train additional treatment centers, establish patient-focused programs, educate healthcare professionals, and secure reimbursement. The timing and conduct of 
 26


these commercial activities will be dependent upon regulatory approvals and on agreements we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators. As part of the commercialization process, we are engaged in discussions with stakeholders across the healthcare system, including public and private payors, patient advocates and organizations, and healthcare providers, to drive more timely patient identification through education, newborn screening, and diagnostic initiatives and to explore new payment models that we hope will enable broader patient access. We have initiated pilot studies for newborns in certain countries to screen for MLD and develop the necessary data package to enable universal newborn screening in various countries where we expect our products to be sold. Ultimately, we intend to utilize the commercial infrastructure that we are building to support the potential for multiple product launches, if approved, sequentially across multiple geographies. For many territories and countries, we may also elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract field-based teams to assist in the commercialization of our products. We anticipate the list price of Libmeldy to be less than the average 10-year cumulative cost for some chronic or lifelong rare disease treatments, such as certain enzyme replacement therapies, which do not offer the potential for full genetic correction or a potentially positive impact on cognitive outcomes. We are engaging with European country- and regional-level payment authorities to negotiate reimbursement and access and are considering novel payment approaches, such as annuity payments, as part of these negotiation discussions.
Intellectual property and barriers to entry 
 Our commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect commercially important and proprietary aspects of our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets, and operate without infringing misappropriating and otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. In particular, we strive to protect the proprietary aspects of our business and to develop barriers to entry that we believe are important to the development and commercialization of our gene therapies. For example, where appropriate, we develop, or acquire exclusive rights to, clinical data for each of our products/product candidates, patents, know-how and trade secrets associated with each of our products/product candidates. However, we do not own any patents or patent applications that cover Libmeldy, Strimvelis or any of our lead product candidates. We in-license from UCLB and UCLA one family of patents directed at OTL-101, which are issued in the U.S. and Europe We cannot guarantee that patents will issue from any of existing patent applications or from any patent applications we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we guarantee that any patents that may issue in the future from such patent applications will be commercially useful in protecting our products/product candidates. In addition, we plan to rely on regulatory protection based on orphan drug exclusivities, data exclusivities and market exclusivities. See “—Government regulation” for additional information. 
 We currently rely primarily on know-how and trade secret protection for aspects of our proprietary technologies that we or our licensors believe are not amenable to or appropriate for patent protection, including, for example, clinical data and production information for Libmeldy, Strimvelis and each of our product candidates. However, know-how and trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or similar know-how, trade secrets or proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to such know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information or such know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that our confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection or that they may not be breached and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information. 
 In addition, with regard to patent protection, the scope of coverage being sought in a patent application may be reduced significantly before a patent is issued, and even after issuance the scope of coverage may be challenged. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
 With regards to our OTL-101 product candidate, we have exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, licenses pursuant to the UCLB/UCLA Agreement to clinical data and to a patent family containing one issued U.S. patent with claims directed to the OTL-101 product candidate and its use in the treatment of ADA-SCID, and one issued counterpart European patent. These patents are expected to expire in 2036, without taking a potential patent term adjustment or extension into account. In addition, under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement, we have non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, licenses to know-how and materials relating to the OTL-101 product candidate. 
 With regards to Strimvelis, OTL-103, OTL-200 and OTL-300, and as discussed in detail in “—License agreements”, we have exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable licenses pursuant to the GSK Agreement and the R&D Agreement to anonymized patient-level data arising from the clinical trials of Strimvelis, OTL-103, OTL-200 and OTL-300 and know-how, including other clinical data and production information relating to Strimvelis, OTL-103, OTL-200, and OTL-300. 
 27


The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we are seeking patent protection for our product candidates, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, which provides additional term caused by administrative delays at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened it a patent is terminally disclaimer over another patent with an earlier expiration date. 
 Furthermore, in the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if we obtain any additional issued U.S. patents covering one of our present or future product candidates, and if such product candidate receives FDA approval, we expect to apply for a patent term extension, if available, to extend the term of the patent covering such approved product candidate. We also expect to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such an extension should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such an extension. 
 License agreements 
 GSK asset purchase and license agreement 
 In April 2018, we entered into the GSK Agreement pursuant to which GSK transferred to us its portfolio of approved and investigational rare disease gene therapies, including Strimvelis, the first gene therapy approved by the EMA for ADA-SCID, two late-stage clinical gene therapy programs in ongoing registrational trials, OTL-200 for MLD and OTL-103 for WAS; and OTL-300, a clinical-stage gene therapy program for TDT. In addition, GSK novated to us their R&D Agreement with Telethon-OSR. 
 Under the GSK Agreement, we are subject to certain obligations to develop and advance certain of the acquired product candidates. For example, we are required to first use best endeavors to file an MAA for OTL-200 for MLD in either Europe or a BLA for MLD in the United States and to subsequently use commercially reasonable efforts to file an MAA or BLA, as applicable, in the other jurisdiction and to market, sell and promote OTL-200 in such jurisdictions.  In December 2020, we received full, or standard, marketing authorization for Libmeldy in the European Union as well as the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. We are also required to use best endeavors to file a BLA for OTL-103 for WAS in the United States and to use commercially reasonable efforts to file an MAA for OTL-103 in Europe, and to subsequently market, sell and promote OTL-103 in such jurisdictions. We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and file an MAA or BLA, as applicable, for OTL-300 for TDT in either the United States or Europe. In addition, we must also use best endeavors to maintain the MAA and regulatory designations for Strimvelis in the European Union and to continue to make Strimvelis available to eligible patients until an alternative gene therapy product has received marketing approval in Europe. We must also continue to make Strimvelis available at the San Raffaele Hospital for as long as a minimum number of patients are treated and entitled to receive reimbursement for the provision of Strimvelis, over a defined period. We intend to continue to make Strimvelis available for so long as we are required to do so under the GSK Agreement. 
 We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a PRV from the FDA for each of Strimvelis, OTL-200, OTL-103 and OTL-300 and to transfer the first such PRV to GSK. GSK also has an option to acquire at a defined price any PRVs granted to us thereafter for Strimvelis, OTL-200, OTL-103 and OTL-300. In the event that GSK does not exercise this option with respect to any PRV, we may sell the PRV to a third party and must share any proceeds in excess of a specified sale price equally with GSK. 
 Under the GSK Agreement we are also obligated to pay non-refundable royalties and milestone payments in relation to the gene therapy programs acquired and OTL-101. We will pay a mid-single-digit percentage royalty on the combined annual net sales of ADA-SCID products, which includes Strimvelis and our product candidate, OTL-101. We will also pay tiered royalty rates at percentages from the mid-teens to the low twenties for the MLD and WAS products, upon marketing approval, calculated as percentages of aggregate cumulative net sales of the MLD and WAS products, respectively. We will pay a tiered royalty at percentages from the high single-digits to the low teens for the TDT product, upon marketing approval, calculated as percentages of aggregate annual net sales of the TDT product. These royalties owed to GSK are in addition to any royalties owed to other third parties under various license agreements for the GSK programs. In aggregate, we may pay up to £90.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain sales milestones. Our royalty obligations with respect to MLD and WAS may be deferred for a certain period in the interest of prioritizing available capital to develop each product. Our royalty obligations are subject to reduction on a product-by-product basis in the event of market control by biosimilars and will expire in April 2048. 
 28


We may terminate our development and/or commercialization activities of any of the programs under the GSK Agreement, upon the occurrence of an SAE, or if we believe such program poses a safety risk to patients. GSK may require us to grant a third party a non-exclusive license under the intellectual property we have acquired from GSK under the GSK Agreement if we materially breach of our obligations to use best endeavors and/or commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the acquired programs and fail to develop and implement a mutually agreeable plan to cure such material breach within a specified time period. The foregoing license only continues until such time as we cure our material breach and we must pay GSK all amounts we receive from the third party in connection with such license. 
 Telethon-OSR research and development collaboration and license agreement 
 In April 2018, in connection with our entering into the GSK Agreement, we entered into a deed of novation with GSK, Telethon Foundation and San Raffaele Hospital, together referred to as Telethon-OSR, pursuant to which we acquired and assumed all of GSK’s rights and obligations under the R&D Agreement with Telethon-OSR for the research, development and commercialization of ex vivo HSC gene therapies for ADA-SCID, WAS, MLD, TDT, and options on three additional earlier-stage development programs.
 Pursuant to the R&D Agreement, Telethon-OSR had granted to GSK an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of ADA-SCID. In addition, Telethon-OSR had granted to GSK an exclusive option for an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize certain vectors and gene therapy products from disease-specific development programs for the treatment of WAS, MLD, TDT. At the time we entered into the deed of novation agreement, GSK had completed development, launched and commercialized Strimvelis for ADA-SCID in the European Union, and had exercised its exclusive option to obtain exclusive licenses from Telethon-OSR to the WAS, MLD and TDT programs. We acquired Strimvelis and GSK’s exclusive licenses relating to the ADA-SCID, WAS, MLD and TDT collaboration programs pursuant to the GSK Agreement and to the deed of novation. 
 Under the R&D Agreement, Telethon-OSR is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct each of the collaboration programs in accordance with development plans approved by a joint steering committee. With respect to those programs in relation to which our option has been exercised, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval, launch and promote in both the European Union and the United States all licensed products and to commercialize and manufacture such products at levels sufficient to meet commercial demands. We are required to use best efforts to renew the European Union marketing authorization for Strimvelis to enable patients to be treated at the San Raffaele hospital from all referring centers globally, as permitted by applicable law. We are responsible for the costs and activities associated with the continued development of Strimvelis and each program for which an option under the R&D Agreement is exercised. 
 As consideration for the licenses and options granted under the R&D Agreement, we are required to make payments to Telethon-OSR upon achievement of certain product development milestones. We are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of €31.0 million in connection with product development milestones with respect to those programs for which we have exercised an option under this agreement (that is, our WAS, MLD and TDT programs). Additionally, we are required to pay to Telethon-OSR a tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalty percentage on net annual sales of licensed products on a country-by-country basis, as well as a low double-digit percentage of sublicense income received from any certain third party sublicensees of the collaboration programs. Our royalty obligation expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the latest to occur of the expiration of the last valid claim under the licensed patent rights in such country, the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, and the expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity in such country, provided that our royalty obligation will terminate immediately in the event significant generic or biosimilar competition to a licensed product achieves a certain threshold percentage of the market share. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the R&D Agreement will expire (i) on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to such product in such country, (ii) in its entirety upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to the last product in all countries in the world and (iii), on a program-by-program basis when no vector or gene therapy product is being researched, developed or commercialized. Either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate the R&D Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within a certain period of time. Additionally, either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate involvement in a collaboration program for compelling safety reasons, and either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate the R&D Agreement if the other party becomes insolvent. We may also terminate the R&D Agreement either in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis for any reason upon notice to Telethon-OSR. 
 UCLB/UCLA license agreement 
 In February 2016, we entered into a license agreement, or the UCLB/UCLA Agreement, with UCLB and UCLA, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain technology, clinical data, manufacturing know-

how, and intellectual property rights related to the production of virally transduced HSCs for treatment of patients with ADA-SCID, in addition to certain other rare disease indications. We must use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize a gene therapy product in each of the foregoing indications in the United States, United Kingdom and at least one of France, Germany, Italy and Spain as soon as reasonably possible. 
 Under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement, we are also obligated to pay UCL royalties ranging from low to mid-single-digit percentages on net sales of each of the product candidates subject to the UCLB/UCLA Agreement that receive marketing approval. Our royalty obligations under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement terminate in February 2041. In addition, we are required to pay to UCLB milestone payments up to an aggregate of £28.9 million ($37.9 million as of December 31, 2019) upon achievement of our first, second and third marketing approvals of product candidates under the UCLB/UCLA Agreement. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the UCLB/UCLA Agreement will expire in February 2041. We may terminate the UCLB/UCLA Agreement in its entirety or with respect to either UCLB or UCLA for any reason upon prior written notice. Additionally, either we or UCLB may terminate the UCLB/UCLA Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within a certain period of time, or if the other party becomes insolvent. 
 Oxford BioMedica license and development agreement 
 In November 2016, we entered into a license and development agreement, or the Oxford Development Agreement, with Oxford BioMedica (UK) Limited, or Oxford BioMedica, for the development of gene therapies for ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and certain other diseases that we may request be included under the Oxford Development Agreement, such other diseases referred to as Subsequent Indications. The Oxford Development Agreement was amended on multiple occasions and most recently in April 2020.
 Pursuant to the Oxford Development Agreement, Oxford BioMedica granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights for the purposes of research, development and commercialization of ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and Subsequent Indications, except that such license is non-exclusive to the extent the treatment of a Subsequent Indication is the subject of a certain previous license granted by Oxford BioMedica. Oxford BioMedica also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights for the purposes of research, development, commercialization and manufacture of ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of certain diseases other than ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and Subsequent Indications. Under the Oxford Development Agreement, Oxford BioMedica is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the activities set forth in a collaboration plan approved by a joint steering committee, and we are responsible for certain costs of the activities set forth in such collaboration plan. 
 As consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 588,220 of our ordinary shares to Oxford BioMedica. We are also obligated to issue additional equity upon the achievement of certain milestones, pursuant to which we issued 150,826 ordinary shares upon the achievement of the first milestone in November 2017 and 150,826 ordinary shares were issued upon the achievement of further milestones in August 2018. In April 2020, the fifth milestone was deemed to have been met upon execution of the amended agreement in April 2020, and the Company issued another 75,413 ordinary shares to Oxford BioMedica. Additionally, we are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on net sales of licensed products until January 31, 2039. The foregoing royalties are reduced by a mid-double digit percentage in the case of compassionate use of a licensed product in a country until the first commercial sale following marketing authorization in such country. We are also required to pay a set monthly fee to Oxford BioMedica in the event we use a certain Oxford BioMedica system for generating stable cell lines. 
 Unless terminated earlier, the Oxford Development Agreement will expire when no further payments are due to Oxford BioMedica. We may terminate the performance of the collaboration plan upon notice to Oxford BioMedica, and either party may terminate the performance of the collaboration plan or the Oxford Development Agreement if the other party commits a material breach that is not cured within a certain period of time. Either party may also terminate the Oxford Development Agreement in the event the other party becomes insolvent. 
 Telethon-OSR license agreement
 In May 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Telethon-OSR under which Telethon-OSR granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of ex vivo autologous HSC lentiviral based gene therapy products for the treatment of MPS-I, including MPS IH. Under the terms of the agreement, Telethon-OSR is entitled to receive an upfront payment, and we may be required to make milestone payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Additionally, we will be required to pay Telethon-OSR a tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalty percentage on annual net sales of licensed products.

Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. While we believe that our portfolio of product candidates and scientific expertise in gene therapy provides us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources. 
 We face competition not only from gene therapy companies, but also from companies that are developing novel, non-gene therapy approaches or improving existing treatment approaches. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, if approved. 
 We are currently aware of the following competitive approaches among our products and clinical programs: 
  
• | MLD: To our knowledge, beyond Libmeldy in Europe, there is currently no other effective treatment option for patients with MLD. HSCT, for example, has demonstrated limited efficacy in halting disease progression and is therefore not considered a standard of care for this disease. A number of alternative approaches to HSCT are under investigation. For instance, Homology Medicines is at the preclinical stage of developing an in vivo AAV gene therapy for MLD delivered intravenously, and Passage Bio also has a preclinical development program for MLD. We are also aware that Takeda is investigating an ERT for MLD with a biweekly intrathecal infusion, and Denali Therapeutics is at the preclinical stage of developing a recombinant ARSA enzyme engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MPS-I: The current standard of care for MPS-IH patients is HSCT before the age of 30 months. We are aware that REGENXBIO is developing an AAV-based gene therapy, which is in Phase I trials and to be delivered intracisternally. bluebird bio and Immusoft have both reported that they are developing ex vivo cell therapies in the preclinical stage. For MPS-I patients that are not suitable candidates for HSCT because they lack a suitable donor, were diagnosed later in life, or have a less severe subtype of MPS-I, the current standard of care for the treatment of MPS-I involves regular intravenous injections of laronidase (Aldurazyme), an ERT commercialized by BioMarin and Sanofi Genzyme. A formulation of laronidase for intrathecal administration is currently under evaluation. JCR Pharmaceuticals is developing an ERT, which is in Phase I trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MPS-IIIA: There are currently no effective disease modifying treatment options for patients with MPS-IIIA. We are aware of three gene therapy candidates in clinical development. In collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics, Lysogene is developing an AAV gene therapy product administered through intracerebral injections; Abeona Therapeutics is developing AAV gene therapy product administered intravenously; and Esteve is developing an AAV gene therapy administered through intracerebroventricular injection. Amicus Therapeutics is at the preclinical stage of developing an AAV gene therapy for MPS-IIIA. Currently we are not aware of any companies developing ERTs for MPS-IIIA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WAS: The current standard of care for WAS is HSCT. Patients who are unable to match with a blood donor or who are otherwise ineligible for HSCT may pursue palliative care options, including intravenous immunoglobulin and antimicrobials to prevent and treat infections, topical corticosteroids to manage outbreaks of eczema, platelet transfusions to treat severe bleeds, and immunosuppressive drugs, such as rituximab (Rituxan), to counter autoimmune manifestations. Splenectomy may also be used to treat thrombocytopenia. These palliative approaches do not slow disease progression or address the underlying cause of WAS. In June 2020, CSL Behring and Seattle Children’s Research Institute announced an early-stage research collaboration to develop a ex vivo HSC gene therapy for WAS. We are also aware that Généthon and Boston Children’s Hospital are sponsoring clinical trials with ex vivo HSC gene therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | X-CGD: Disease management options for patients with X-CGD include prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal medications and interferon-gamma therapy. HSCT is also a treatment option for some patients for whom a sufficiently well-matched donor is identified. We are not aware of any other competing clinical or preclinical programs in X-CGD.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ADA-SCID: The current standards of care for the treatment of ADA-SCID are HSCT and chronic ERT. In October 2018, the FDA approved elapegademase-lvlr (Revcovi), a PEGylated recombinant ADA ERT marketed by Leadiant Biosciences to treat ADA-SCID.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TDT: The current standard of care for the treatment of TDT involves chronic blood transfusions to address anemia combined with iron chelation therapy to manage the iron overload often associated with such chronic blood transfusions. HSCT is also a treatment option for some patients for whom a sufficiently well-matched donor is identified. TDT is a highly competitive research area in gene therapy, with one ex vivo HSC gene

therapy treatment already approved in Europe (Zynteglo) and several novel approaches under investigation, notably gene editing. Other non-gene therapy approaches have been approved (e.g., Reblozyl) or are under investigation to improve treatment outcomes in broader populations of beta-thalassemia. Other programs for TDT include a clinical stage ex vivo gene editing program from Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics, and a preclinical ex vivo gene editing program from Editas Medicine.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | GRN-FTD: There are no approved disease modifying treatments for GRN-FTD. Each of Prevail Therapeutics (now owned by Eli Lilly & Company) and Passage Bio is developing in early-stage clinical trials an AAV gene therapy to be delivered intra-cisterna magna. Alector is developing a monoclonal antibody designed to increase levels of GRN in the brain in late-stage clinical trials, and Denali Therapeutics is developing a modified protein designed to penetrate across the blood-brain barrier at the preclinical stage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ALS: There are currently few approved treatment options for ALS, limited to riluzole and edaravone. Multiple companies are developing gene therapies for genetically defined populations of ALS. We are not aware of any companies developing therapies targeted to reduce expression of Nox2.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NOD2-Crohn’s: There are no approved treatment options specifically for the NOD-2 form of Crohn’s disease, and many patients with Crohn’s disease have uncontrolled symptoms despite treatment with standard of care, including multiple anti-inflammatory biologics and surgical interventions. We are not aware of any other treatments in development specifically for the NOD-2 form of Crohn’s disease.

 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors. 
 Government regulation 
 In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product must be reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval must be obtained before the marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional laws and regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state legislatures, agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard, could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 32


U.S. biological products development process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, unless justified, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each study may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or CGTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA in accordance with any applicable expedited programs or designations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved BLA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 33


Following commencement of a clinical trial, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. 
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval or licensing. In particular, such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The FDA must be able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary by the FDA. 
 An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. 
 In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to review by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, of the NIH, Office of Biotechnology Activities, or the OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH Guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications. During the public comment period, which closed October 16, 2018, the NIH announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. In April 2019, NIH announced the updated guidelines, which reflect these proposed changes, and clarified that these trials will remain subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. Further, NIH renamed the RAC the Novel and Exceptional Technology and Research Advisory Committee, or NExTRAC, and revised its role to provide recommendations to the NIH Director and a public forum for the discussion of the scientific, safety, and ethical issues associated with emerging biotechnologies. 
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 34


 
• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA generally recommends that sponsors of human gene therapy products integrating vectors such as gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors and transposon elements observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. 
 Both the FDA and the EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of drug product candidates for treatment of rare diseases, particularly life-threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such drug product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following a single clinical trial in a limited patient population, sometimes referred to as a Phase 1/2 trial, but which may be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial following review of the trial’s design and primary endpoints by the applicable regulatory agencies. Determination of the requirements to be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial is subject to the applicable regulatory authority’s scientific judgement and these requirements may differ in the U.S. and the European Union. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. review and approval processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 35


Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a ‘‘filing’’ decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure the continued safety, purity and potency of such product. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the CGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the CGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through appropriate screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions preventing the conduct or completion of facility or clinical site inspections can lead to FDA deferred action on marketing applications or the issuance of complete response letters. To assure cGMP, CGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control. 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 36


If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product for the same use or indication, and we are unable to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior to the previously approved drug for the same use or indication. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers 
 Under the FD&C Act, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs and biological products that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug or biological product for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the United States of such drug or biological product. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug or biological product application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug or biological product, referred to as a priority review voucher, or PRV. A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its BLA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026.
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not 
 37


change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. 
 Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. 
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. 
 Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 RMAT designation 
 As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of RMAT, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. RMAT do not include those HCT/Ps regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like some of FDA’s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We currently rely, and may continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-
 38


keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must 
 39


demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 A reference biological product is granted four- and 12-year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor. 
 Additional regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 
 Government regulation outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 European Union clinical trials regulation
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s National Competent Authority, or NCA, and at least one independent Ethics Committee, or EC, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s 
 40


requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. Under the current regime (the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and corresponding national laws) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each European Union Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will come into effect following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, the centralized European Union portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the new Clinical Trials regulation, through an independent audit, which is currently expected to occur in December 2021.
 Drug review and approval in the EEA
 In the European Economic Area (comprised of the European Union Member States plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EEA and national levels. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products. Gene therapy products deliver genes into the body that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect. Libmeldy is authorized as a gene therapy product in the EEA, and we anticipate that our gene therapy development products would also be regulated as ATMPs in the EEA. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of an ATMP under EEA regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA under the centralized procedure administered by the EMA. The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, , certain specific requirements set out in the ATMP Regulation, for example certain particulars to be contained in the summary of product characteristics. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across all of the EEA. As provided for in the ATMP Regulation, the scientific evaluation of MAAs for ATMPs is primarily performed by a specialized scientific committee called the Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT. The CAT prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of the ATMP which is the subject of the MAA, which is sent for final approval to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The CHMP recommendation is then sent to the European Commission, which adopts a decision binding in all EEA Member States. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA for an ATMP is 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CAT and/or CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days.  Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation.  Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the timeframe of 210 days for assessment will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January, 1 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required.
 
Data and marketing exclusivity
 The EEA also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving marketing authorization in the EEA, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market 
 41


exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on a MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. There is, however, no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may therefore not qualify for data exclusivity. 
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 Products with an orphan designation in the EEA can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time “no similar medicinal product” for the same indication may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EEA where an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; and (2) either the prevalence of such condition must not be more than five in 10,000 persons in the EEA when the application is made, or without the benefits derived from orphan status, it must be unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EEA to justify the investment needed for its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EEA, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Otherwise, orphan medicine marketing exclusivity may be revoked only in very select cases, such as if: 
  
• | a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the marketing authorization holder consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the marketing authorization holder cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

 In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

PRIME Designation 
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the marketing authorization application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which where is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EEA or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or CAT are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
 Post-approval controls 
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include the following:
  
• | The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each European Union Member State and can differ from one country to another.

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
 In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which European Union pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the United Kingdom. This transition period ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom as United Kingdom legislation now has the potential to diverge from European Union legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom in the long-term. The MHRA, the United Kingdom medicines and medical devices regulator, has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now that the transition period is over, which will be updated as the United Kingdom’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time. Brexit has also created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom, and in particular, how data transfers from the European Union to the United Kingdom will be regulated.  The European Union and the United Kingdom have agreed a bridging period of up to 6 months to allow the continued free flow of data from the European Union to the United Kingdom, during which time the European Commission will assess whether the United Kingdom will be granted adequacy status.  There is no certainty that an adequacy decision will be granted. If it is not, legal uncertainties regarding the flow of data across borders could increase the complexity and cost of transferring personal data from the European Union to the United Kingdom.

Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements 
 In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable:
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family

members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the above, on November 20, 2020, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, finalized further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. The final rule (with some exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these rules will have on our business.
 Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 We may also be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area, or EEA, including personal health data, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states. 
 Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and imprisonment, any of which 
 45


could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. In addition, our gene therapy programs for Strimvelis and Libmeldy were approved by the EMA in 2016 and 2020, respectively, and the approval and commercialization of Strimvelis and Libmeldy subjects us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. The approval and commercialization of any of our other gene therapies outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. 
 If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business. 
 The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain a robust system to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial cost. 
 Healthcare reform 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual, nondeductible fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the PHS Act’s pharmaceutical pricing program, also known as the 340B Drug Pricing Program; created new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act; created a new requirement to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that manufacturers and authorized distributors of record provide to physicians; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The Trump administration has concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. On August 14, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid CSRs for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and 
 46


later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. On April 27, 2020, the United States Supreme Court reversed the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula.
 Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and held oral arguments on November 10, 2020. It is unclear what effect this will have on the status of the ACA and our business. In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Since then, the ACA risk adjustment program payment parameters have been updated annually. In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA -mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices; however, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to legislation amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions are suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap 
 47


Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. . Further, the Trump administration also previously released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that became effective January 1, 2019. In addition, there has been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. On December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a reimbursement formula change under the 340B drug pricing program, and CMS subsequently altered the FYs 2019 and 2018 reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs (“"SCODs”"). The court ruled this change was not an “adjustment” which was within the Secretary’s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation. However, most recently, on July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court’s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary’s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), but was denied on October 16, 2020. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any. While a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. 
 Further, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump signed several Executive Orders aimed at lowering drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. The FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model  under which  Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita.  The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027.  The Interim Final Rule has not been finalized and is subject to revision and challenge. Additionally, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval.  There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.

Coverage and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any gene therapies for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any gene therapies for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from payors. Payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers generally rely on these third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a payor not to cover our gene therapies could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development and manufacturing costs. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or may lose employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products in certain jurisdictions.
 In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
 Additionally, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
 Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive evidence generation studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to current standards of care , they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to cover its costs or make a profit. 
 Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed with the government authority. Furthermore, some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to current standards of care as part of so-called health technology assessments, or HTAs, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Additionally, there may be a need for activities to secure reimbursement for procedures associated with products administered in a hospital setting, such as Libmeldy, under the diagnosis-related group, or DRG, system, whereby a billing code may not exist or may be currently insufficient to cover the cost of the procedure. In other instances, countries may monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions in the form of treatment policies. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 224 full-time employees.  We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be positive. We monitor employee engagement through an annual survey and develop a prioritized action plan on an annual basis to address any areas in need of attention. Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, developing, retaining, and incentivizing our existing and prospective employees, as well as optimizing the overall employee experience. The principal purposes of our incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate our employees. The granting of share-based compensation awards are designed to reward selected employees for long-term shareholder value creation and our cash-based performance bonus awards reward the achievement of annual performance goals. The health and safety of our employees, customers and communities are of primary concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant
