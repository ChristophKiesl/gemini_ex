Overview
Alico is an agribusiness with a legacy of achievement and innovation in citrus and conservation. The Company owns approximately 122,000 acres of land in twelve Florida counties (Alachua, Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Martin, Osceola and Polk) including approximately 90,000 acres of mineral rights. Our principal lines of business are citrus groves and conservation. 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, the Company acquired three Florida citrus properties for total consideration of approximately $363,000,000. These acquisitions make Alico one of the largest citrus producers in the United States of America.
Our mission is to create value for our customers and stockholders by managing existing lands to their optimal current income and total returns, opportunistically acquiring new agricultural assets and producing high quality agricultural products while exercising responsible environmental stewardship.
We manage our land based upon its primary usage and review its performance based upon two primary classifications - Alico Citrus (formerly known as Orange Co) and Conservation and Environmental Resources. In addition, Other Operations include lease income from an aggregates mine and leases of oil extraction rights to third parties among other insignificant lines of business. We present our financial results and the related discussion based upon our three business segments (Alico Citrus, Conservation and Environmental Resources, and Other Operations). 
Recent Developments
Water Storage Contract Approval
In December 2012, the South Florida Water Management District (“SFWMD” or "District") issued a solicitation request for projects to be considered for the Northern Everglades Payment for Environmental Services Program ("Program"). In March 2013, the Company submitted its response proposing a dispersed water management project on a portion of its ranch land. The dispersed water management project ("Water Project") encompasses a large-scale water storage/nutrient reduction project over approximately half of the Company's 71,000-acre ranch located in southern Hendry County. The Water Project has the ability to store/treat 94,000-acre feet of water, making it one of the largest private storage projects proposed to date and the largest within the Caloosahatchee River watershed. The Water Project was approved by the South Florida Water Management District in late 2014, and the Company's engineering and environmental consultants immediately began working on a detailed design. As a result of the uniqueness of the project site, which consists of over 11,000 acres of wetlands and contains several cultural resource sites, considerable effort has been undertaken over the past 2.5 years in securing necessary regulatory approvals for the project from both the State of Florida and the federal government. In addition, the largeness of the project requires close coordination with adjacent landowners, as well as the water control districts that serve those landowner/properties. On September 29, 2015, the SFWMD amended the contract to extend it for an additional year.

The contract term is eleven years and allows up to one year for implementation (design, permitting, construction and construction completion certification) and ten years of operation, whereby the Company will provide water retention services. Payment for these services includes an amount not to exceed $4,000,000 of reimbursement for implementation. In addition, it provides for an annual fixed payment of $12,000,000 for operations and maintenance costs, as long as the project is in compliance with the contract and subject to annual District Board approval of funding. The contract specifies that the District Board has to approve the payments annually and there can be no assurance that it will approve the annual fixed payments. The Florida budget for the state’s 2017/2018 fiscal year as approved included funding for the Program. Permitting is currently underway with construction to follow immediately upon receipt of permits. Annual fixed payments will not commence until completion of construction. The Company anticipates receiving all necessary regulatory approvals within the next four to six months. The Company has not recognized any revenue to date from the contract. Operating expenses were approximately $1,794,000, $2,322,000 and $2,126,000 for the three years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Hurricane Irma
Florida’s citrus industry was hit hard by the recent impacts of Hurricane Irma. We estimate that production will be down 40-45% from the prior season that was completed in June 2017. While we lost a small percentage of trees, the force and duration of the storm impacted the majority of the groves. Based upon prior experience with serious storms of this nature, we expect it will take at least two seasons for the groves to recover to pre-hurricane production levels. We estimate production between approximately 4,000,000 - 4,400,000 boxes in fiscal 2018, an increase in production in fiscal 2019 and a return to pre-hurricane production levels by fiscal 2020. We maintain crop insurance and are working closely with our insurers and adjusters to evaluate and determine the amount of insurance recoveries we will be entitled to, if any. We are also working with Florida Citrus Mutual, the industry trade group, and government agencies on potential federal relief funds. As of December 1, 2017, the Company donated $45,000 to 8 local charitable organizations to support local relief efforts for individuals affected by Hurricane Irma.
Alico 2.0 Modernization Program
On November 16, 2017, we announced the Alico 2.0 Modernization Program (“Alico 2.0”). This program is transforming three legacy businesses (Alico, Orange Co., and Silver Nip) into a single efficient enterprise, Alico Citrus, so we will remain one of the leaders in the U.S. citrus industry. This initiative explored every aspect of Alico’s citrus and ranch operations, including corporate and operational cost structures, grove costs, purchasing and procurement, non-performing and under-performing assets, professional fees, and human resources efficiency.
Under this program, we expect to reduce citrus total expenses per acre from $3,314/acre in fiscal 2016 to $2,164/acre when Alico 2.0 is fully implemented. Overall, we expect the program to reduce the Company’s cost to produce a pound solid from $2.14 to $1.56. These efficiencies will be achieved through better purchasing, more precise application of selected fertilizers and chemicals, outsourcing work such as harvesting, hauling, and certain caretaking tasks, and by streamlining grove management. We also plan to deploy a more efficient labor model that is consistent and uniform for field staffing and grove operating programs and aligns with the geographical footprint of the citrus groves. 
In addition to grove cost savings, Alico Citrus’ general and administrative expenses are projected to decline by more than 25% over the next two years, and recent information technology investments have already automated and simplified many administrative tasks.
Alico 2.0 led us to decide to divest assets that generated low rates of return and shut down parts of our operations that were not profitable. Alico Citrus has shut down its nursery in Gainesville, is in the process of selling its trucks and trailers, consolidating offices, and has either sold or is in the process of selling real estate assets that are not strategic to our business plan. 
We plan on ceasing our direct cattle operations at Alico Ranch. The ranch has been a landholding for us for generations, but, even when profitable, ranch operations generated a minimal rate of return on capital. We will continue to own the property and still conduct our long term water dispersement program and wildlife management programs, but we will lease the ranch to a third party operator instead of conducting our own cattle operations. All of these decisions are intended to enable additional investment in the citrus business and redeployment of capital elsewhere.
Alico 2.0 also includes an enhanced program to plant more than 400,000 trees in fiscal year 2018, which is expected to drive growth beyond 2020. The Company believes that its current acreage can produce 10,000,000 boxes per year on a sustained basis, even in an environment where citrus greening continues.

Operating Segments

Operating segments are defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") - Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") ASC Topic 280, "Segment Reporting" as components of public entities that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses for which separate financial information is available and which is evaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to assess performance and allocate resources. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s CODM assessed performance and allocated resources based on three operating segments: Alico Citrus, Conservation and Environmental Resources, and Other Operations. 

Effective October 1, 2015, which was the first day of Alico's fiscal year 2016, the Company operates three business segments related to its various land holdings, as follows:


• | Alico Citrus includes activities related to planting, owning, cultivating and/or managing citrus groves in order to produce fruit for sale to fresh and processed citrus markets, including activities related to the purchase and resale of fruit and value-added services, which include contracting for the harvesting, marketing and hauling of citrus.


• | Conservation and Environmental Resources includes activities related to cattle grazing, sod, native plant and animal sales, leasing, management and/or conservation of unimproved native pasture land.


• | Other Operations consists of activities related to rock mining royalties, oil exploration and other insignificant lines of business. Also included are activities related to owning and/or leasing improved farmland. Improved farmland is acreage that has been converted, or is permitted to be converted, from native pasture and which may have various improvements including irrigation, drainage and roads. 

The Land We Manage
We regularly review our land holdings to determine the best use of each parcel based upon our management expertise. Our total return profile is a combination of operating income potential and long-term appreciation. Land holdings not meeting our total return criteria are considered surplus to our operations and will be sold or exchanged for land considered to be more compatible with our business objectives and total return profile. 
Our land holdings and the operating activities in which we engage are categorized in the following table:

 | Gross Acreage | Operating Activities
Alico Citrus | | | 
Citrus Groves | 47,167 | | Citrus Cultivation 
Citrus Nursery | 385 | | Citrus Tree Development 
 | 47,552 | | 
Conservation and Environmental Resources | 70,962 | | Cattle Grazing; Sod and Native Plant Sales; Leasing; Conservation
Other Operations | | 
Farmland | 1,825 | | Leasing 
Other Land | 1,436 | | Mining lease; Commercial; Office 
Total | 121,775 | | 

Alico Citrus
We own and manage citrus land in Alachua, DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, Osceola, Martin, and Hardee Counties and engage in the cultivation of citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the fresh and processed citrus markets. Alico citrus groves total approximately 48,000 gross acres or 39.1% of our land holdings.

Our citrus acreage is detailed in the following table:

 | Net Plantable | | | 
 | Producing | Developing | Fallow | Total Plantable | Support & Other | Gross
Alachua County | — | | — | | — | | — | 385 | 385 
DeSoto County | 15,013 | | 1,090 | | 482 | | 16,585 | 4,623 | 21,208
Polk County | 4,558 | | 95 | | — | | 4,653 | 2,152 | 6,805 
Collier County | 4,468 | | — | | — | | 4,468 | 2,823 | 7,291 
Hendry County | 3,517 | | 97 | | 175 | | 3,789 | 1,696 | 5,485 
Charlotte County | 1,770 | | — | | 138 | | 1,908 | 635 | 2,543 
Highlands County | 1,093 | | — | | — | | 1,093 | 131 | 1,224 
Osceola County | 937 | | — | | — | | 937 | 426 | 1,363 
Martin County | 551 | | — | | — | | 551 | 123 | 674 
Hardee County | 403 | | — | | — | | 403 | 171 | 574 
Total | 32,310 | | 1,282 | | 795 | | 34,387 | 13,165 | 47,552

Of the approximately 48,000 gross acres of citrus land we own and manage, approximately 13,200 acres are classified as support acreage. Support acreage includes acres used for roads, barns, water detention, water retention and drainage ditches integral to the cultivation of citrus trees but which are not capable of directly producing fruit. In addition, we own a citrus tree nursery and utilize the trees produced in our own operations. The approximately 34,400 remaining acres are classified as net plantable acres. Net plantable acres are those that are capable of directly producing fruit. These include acres that are currently producing, acres that are developing (acres that are planted in trees too young to commercially produce fruit) and acres that are fallow.
Our Alico Citrus business segment cultivates citrus trees to produce citrus for delivery to the processed and fresh citrus markets. Our sales to the processed market were approximately 91.7%, 86.9% and 88.0% of Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We produce Early and Mid-Season varieties, primarily Hamlin oranges, as well as a Valencia variety for the processed market. We deliver our fruit to the processors in boxes which contain approximately 90 pounds of oranges. Because the processors convert the majority of the citrus crop into orange juice, they generally do not buy their citrus on a per box basis but rather on a pound solids basis, which is the measure of the soluble solids (sugars and acids) contained in one box of citrus fruit. We produced approximately 42,611,000, 51,404,000 and 62,222,000 pound solids for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on boxes delivered to processing plants of approximately 7,259,000, 8,829,000 and 10,014,000, respectively.
The average pound solids per box was 5.87, 5.82 and 6.21 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We generally use multi-year contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (“floor”) price with a price increase (“rise”) based on market conditions. Therefore, if pricing in the market is favorable relative to our floor price, we benefit from the incremental difference between the floor and the final market price.
The majority of our citrus produced for the processed citrus market in fiscal year 2017-2018 will be under minimum price contracts with floor prices ranging from $2.05 to $2.15 and rise prices from $2.50 to $2.65 per pound solids. We believe that other markets are available for our citrus products; however, new arrangements may be less favorable than our current contracts.
Our sales to the fresh market constituted approximately 4.6%, 3.8% and 4.2% of our Alico Citrus revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We produce numerous varieties for the fresh fruit market including grapefruit, navel and other fresh varieties. Generally, our fresh fruit is sold to packing houses by the box and the packing houses are responsible for the harvest and haul of these boxes. We produced approximately 328,000, 402,000 and 466,000 fresh fruit boxes for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The majority of our citrus to be produced for the fresh citrus market in fiscal year 2017-2018 is under fixed price contracts.
Revenues from our Alico Citrus operations were approximately 95.1%, 95.2% and 95.5% of our total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Conservation and Environmental Resources
We own and manage Conservation and Environmental Resources land in Collier and Hendry Counties and engage in cattle grazing and sales, sod and native plant sales, land leasing for recreational and grazing purposes and conservation activities. Of our land holdings, Conservation and Environmental Resources totals approximately 71,000 gross acres or 58.3% of our total acreage.
Our Conservation and Environmental Resources acreage is detailed in the following table as of September 30, 2017:

 | Acreage
Hendry County | 66,940 
Collier County | 4,022 
Total | 70,962 

We frequently lease the same acreage for more than one purpose. The portion of our Conservation and Environmental Resources acreage that is leased for each purpose is detailed in the table below:

 | Grazing | Recreational
Hendry County | 1,282 | | 51,686
Collier County | 4,000 | | 3,493 
Glades County | 145 | | — 

In fiscal year 2017, our cattle operation was engaged in the production of beef cattle in Hendry and Collier Counties. The breeding herd consisted of approximately 8,700 cows and bulls. We primarily sold our calves to feed yards and yearling grazing operations in the United States. We also sold cattle through local livestock auction markets and to contract cattle buyers in the United States. These buyers provide ready markets for our cattle. Revenues from our Conservation and Environmental Resources operations were approximately 3.7%, 3.9% and 3.5% of total operating revenues for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
In November 2017, Alico changed its strategy about its cattle operations. A contract is pending with an experienced rancher who will lease the entire Alico Ranch for 10 years and graze cattle. The entire herd will be sold to this rancher, along with other assets, as part of this transaction. Once this contract is consummated, Alico will remain as the owner of Alico Ranch, will conduct its conservation and other leasing activities, will fulfill its water storage contract but will no longer produce beef cattle. 
Our Strategy
Our core business strategy is to maximize stockholder value through continuously improving the return on our invested capital, either by holding and managing our existing land through skilled agricultural production, leasing, or other opportunistic means of monetization, disposing of under productive land or business units and/or acquiring new land or operations with appreciation potential.
Our objectives are to produce the highest quality agricultural products, create innovative land uses, opportunistically acquire and convert undervalued assets, sell under-productive land and other assets not meeting our total return profile, generate recurring and sustainable profit with the appropriate balance of risk and reward, and exceed the expectations of stockholders, customers, clients and partners.
Our strategy is based on best management practices of our agricultural operations, environmental and conservation stewardship of our land and natural resources. We manage our land in a sustainable manner and evaluate the effect of changing land uses while considering new opportunities. Our commitment to environmental stewardship is fundamental to the Company’s core beliefs.

Seasonal Nature of Business
As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness operations and revenues are predominantly seasonal in nature. The following table illustrates the seasonality of our agribusiness revenues: 

 | Fiscal Year 
 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 
 | Ending 12/31 | Ending 3/31 | Ending 6/30 | Ending 9/30
 | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sept
Harvest Fresh and Early/Mid Varieties of Oranges | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Harvest Valencia Oranges | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Deliver Beef Cattle | | | | | | | | | | | | 

Competition 
The orange and specialty citrus markets are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Citrus is grown domestically in several states including Florida, California, Arizona and Texas, as well as foreign countries, most notably Brazil. Competition is impacted by several factors including quality, production, demand, brand recognition, market prices, weather, disease, export/import restrictions and foreign currency exchange rates.
Environmental Regulations 
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes we are in compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. In addition, we require lessees of our property to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. 
Employees 
As of September 30, 2017, we had 283 full-time employees. Our employees work in the following divisions: 

Alico Citrus | 240
Conservation and Environmental Resources | 15 
Corporate, General, Administrative and Other | 28 
Total employees | 283

None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Capital resources and raw materials 
Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, and over the long term, through internally generated funds, cash flows from operations, the sale of under-productive land and other assets, our existing lines of credit and access to capital markets. The Company has commitments that provide for lines of revolving credit that are available for our general and corporate use. 
Raw materials needed to cultivate the various crops grown by the Company consist primarily of fertilizers, herbicides and fuel and are readily available from local suppliers.
