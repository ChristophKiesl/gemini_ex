Our Industry and Market Opportunity
Climate change is an existential threat. Severe weather events and broader awareness of the financial implications of climate change are driving a systemic global transition away from fossil fuels towards sustainable energy systems. However, renewable generation, unlike fossil fuel generation, has no inherent storage capacity and can only be used in favorable wind and solar conditions. Energy storage is therefore a critical enabler of large-scale adoption of 24/7 renewable energy. Furthermore, accelerating electrification of industries such as transportation is driving demand for more generation. Energy storage can help both serve and smooth additional peak demand, improving grid reliability and managing energy requirements. 
As the first truly digital asset on the electric grid, energy storage is also a uniquely flexible tool for grid planners, operators, and power providers. We believe energy storage sits at the epicenter of the global clean energy transition and represents the backbone of a massive change in our energy market infrastructure driven by three key trends: Grid modernization, decarbonization, and digitalization. The energy transformation will require $100 trillion of investment through 2050 based on the midpoint of Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s (“BloombergNEF”) NEO 2020 clean electricity and green hydrogen pathway.
Energy Storage Market Opportunity
The energy storage market is comprised of three components: 
• Energy storage products — the components (including batteries), professional services, and labor required to manufacture, assemble, and install products. The energy storage products market is driven by the deployment of new energy storage products globally, and its addressable market is comprised of the annual spend associated with the manufacturing, delivery, and installation of new energy storage products. According to BloombergNEF, global annual energy storage capacity installations, excluding the residential market, grew from 0.6 GW a year in 2015 to 3.8 GW a year in 2020, and are expected to grow to 34.2 GW a year by 2030. We believe most forecasts for the energy storage sector, including BloombergNEF’s, understate the size and market opportunity as forecasts generally only account for spend associated with the physical energy storage asset and do not account for the associated service and digital spend. 
• Services — recurring operational and maintenance services that energy storage products require, management services that are provided by third parties when asset owners outsource the operations of their systems, and the provision of ESaaS. The services market is driven by the growth in installed energy storage products globally, and its addressable market is comprised of the recurring annual service spend across the entire fleet of energy storage products, which is continuing to grow through new product installations. According to BloombergNEF, global installed energy storage capacity, excluding the residential market, grew 57% per annum between 2015 and 2020, and the installed base is expected to grow at a 31% annual growth rate through 2030. BloombergNEF forecasts that global installed energy storage capacity will reach 193.7 GW by 2030, excluding the residential market. 
• Digital applications and solutions — operating systems, applications, such as trading platforms that allow system owners to manage their grid participation, and dynamic capacity services, such as virtual power plants (“VPPs”). These trading platforms and VPPs can be deployed on both energy storage assets and renewable and conventional generation assets. The digital applications and solutions sector is driven by the growth in installed energy storage products and renewable and conventional generation assets, and its addressable market is comprised of the total global installed fleet of energy storage products and renewable and conventional generation assets. The digital applications and solutions economic model is primarily structured as (i) $/kilowatt (“kW”) recurring fixed fees, and in some cases (ii) $/kW performance-based incentive fees both calculated based on the GWs of storage and generation assets on which digital applications and solutions service offerings are deployed. We believe there is an opportunity to not only deploy digital applications and solutions on individual assets but also across entire energy storage fleets and portfolios of generation assets to improve their collective performance and economic output, and to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the electric grid by optimizing the interactions between different asset types. 
We believe there are multiple factors driving continued growth in the energy storage sector, including:
• The accelerating transition from fossil to renewable generation is expected to require significant increases in energy storage capacity to both offset potential grid instability caused by intermittent renewable resources and enable the use of power from renewable generation assets at times when the natural resource is unavailable.
• Growing capacity constraints on existing power grids that were not designed to support distributed and renewable generation infrastructure or technologies such as electric vehicles are positioning energy storage assets as a key solution.
• A forecasted reduction in the battery cost, estimated by BloombergNEF to be approximately 8% annually from 2020 to 2030, is expected to improve the economics of energy storage and support the development of larger energy storage systems.

Our offerings enable more sustainable, reliable, and resilient electric grids in a repeatable, scalable way.
We endeavor to go beyond the inherent environmental aspects of our technology and implement sustainable and ethical processes throughout our organization. Our supplier code of conduct is at the core of our compliance expectations, and addresses environmental protection, child labor, conflict minerals, and anti-corruption, among other areas. In addition, we only purchase raw materials and minerals from trusted suppliers. In sourcing cobalt for example, we request that suppliers provide an official cobalt statement disclosing its origin, and we only buy cobalt battery chemistry from suppliers who are part of a sustainable cobalt sourcing initiative. In 2021, our supply chain sustainability coordinator engaged the Carbon Disclosure Project to conduct an audit of our supply chain’s carbon footprint.
We are committed to implementing responsible environmental and ethical practices in our corporate offices as well as our supply chain. Our offices are internationally certified to ISO 14001, which requires an organization to implement and demonstrate compliance with an effective environmental management system to identify and control the environmental impact of its activities, products, and services; continually improve environmental performance; and implement a systematic approach to setting environmental objectives and targets.
We plan to report how we oversee and manage environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors material to our business under the sector-specific ESG standards recommended by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (the “SASB”), including an annual sustainability report. As part of our plan to provide ESG disclosures pursuant to SASB standards, we will evaluate aligning our internal sustainability goals with certain United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Human Capital Management
We believe our workforce is critical to our success and we strive to create a positive, equitable, and safe work environment. A survey of employees during the pandemic revealed that most people prefer to work remotely rather than in the office, so Fluence has moved to a 75% remote work policy permanently and offers employees a stipend for home office equipment. To create a culture of transparency, we maintain a regular cadence of communications from the executive leadership team to employees, including emails, quarterly all hands meetings, Q&A sessions, and employee resource groups with executive sponsors. 
As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 450 full-time employees. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. As of September 30, 2021, approximately 86 of our employees in Germany were represented by a works council. We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. 
Our purpose-driven culture has fostered a work environment in which employees feel supported, empowered to develop in their careers, and fulfilled in their work. Initiatives driven by this culture include a partnership with Inova through which we provide free professional and wellness services to employees and professional development courses made available to all employees. To assess and continually improve employee sentiment, we conduct regular employee surveys soliciting feedback on topics such as work/life balance, working remotely, career development, and mentorship. 
Fluence is internationally certified to ISO 9001, a quality management standard that ensures a commitment to customer satisfaction, purpose-driven leadership, and equitable involvement for all employees. Fluence is also internationally certified to ISO 45001, an occupational health and safety standard which requires certain proactive measures to ensure employee safety and reduce workplace risks. Fluence’s corporate headquarters is certified to SA8000, which demonstrates our commitment to the elimination of unethical and discriminatory labor practices, while affirming workers’ rights, livable wages, and treating all people with dignity. 
Fluence is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion that makes our employees feel safe and engaged. We have conducted trainings for hiring managers on how to avoid bias in the interview process and formed a diversity and inclusion working group to identify and address areas for improvement. Our workforce includes citizens of 38 countries. Women represent 24% of our total workforce and 40% of our key corporate management roles. 
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing strategy is designed to meet our key objectives: limit capital-intensive and low value-added activities that can be outsourced to other companies; maintain a capital light business model; minimize labor content where possible; minimize the amount of assembly our customers are required to do at the site; and minimize material movement both from vendors to us and within factories. 
Mass manufacturing is a cornerstone of our product delivery approach and a key to driving down product cost and delivering at scale. We aim to create an optimized production organization, develop mass manufacturing capabilities globally through contract manufacturing, and continue to secure partnerships with key battery suppliers. We believe that enhancing our product-focused model and supply chain leverage will support our global growth objectives and result in superior unit economics. 
We have entered outsourcing contracts for the assembly and production of our Fluence Cube, which ship directly from our contract manufacturers to job sites or designated warehouses. By using regional contract manufacturers, we can drop ship products directly to our customers’ sites, which improves working capital turnover, quality, and inventory management. The Fluence Cube is currently manufactured in Asia, and we intend to expand manufacturing to sites in North America and Europe.
We have developed a global supply chain with an evolving regionally focused operational model with the objective of allowing us to assemble products in proximity to major markets to minimize material movement, working capital investment, and costs of goods sold. Additionally, we believe that the volume of key components we purchase, such as lithium-ion batteries, provides us preferential pricing, terms, and availability from our suppliers, creating a competitive advantage. We recently entered into a technology co-development and supply agreement with Northvolt that expands our battery supply chain into Europe. Pursuant to this agreement, we have a license to develop, manufacture and commercialize an optimized battery subsystem that is significantly more energy dense than today’s standard solutions. The agreement also enables us to deploy a battery management system that can be integrated with other vendors to extend our value chain, develop battery competencies, and lower total cost of ownership. 
Intellectual Property
The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies, information, processes and know-how. We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and procedures, and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology. Fluence also has a perpetual license (terminable in the event of an uncured material breach) to certain patents and other intellectual property that belong to AES and Siemens, including methods for cooling inverters, overvoltage protections, and transfer of large amounts of data (methodology). 
-7-


Table of Content

We rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know-how and software that is not patented and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce. We believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures. 
We require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans. 
Seasonality
We experience seasonality and typically see increased order intake in our third and fourth fiscal quarters, driven by demand in the Northern Hemisphere to install energy storage products before the summer of the following year. Combined third and fourth fiscal quarter order intake generally accounted for 80% or more of our total intake each year. As a result, revenue recognition is typically stronger in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Cash flows historically have been negative in our first and second fiscal quarters, neutral to positive in our third fiscal quarter, and positive in our fourth fiscal quarter. Our services and digital application offerings do not experience the same seasonality given their recurring nature. 
Competition
Our products, services, and digital applications are highly specialized and specific to the clean energy industry. The unique expertise required to design these offerings as well as customers’ reluctance to try unproven products has confined the number of firms that produce such products to a relatively small number, particularly in the segments we are targeting. In addition, we are continuously engaging in developing new use cases and opening new market segments, which are often less contested. 
Our principal competitors include Tesla and Wartsila, but competition varies by geography, grid service or customer segment. A key differentiator is our ability to identify customer needs and deliver customer-centric products, services, and use cases that can compete in the market either as packages or standalone offerings. We believe we compete favorably based on performance and value-creation, including low total cost of ownership, long-term reliability, varied service options, and convenient and efficient sales and delivery processes.
Government Regulation and Compliance
Governments across the globe have announced policies to support the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon forms of energy. For example, the United States recently rejoined the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement among almost 200 nations that calls for countries to set their own greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve these targets, and proposed a tax incentive for standalone energy storage projects as part of President Biden’s American Jobs Plan. Internationally, the European Union has proposed legislation targeting achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Australia announced a targeted two thirds reduction in the emissions intensity of its economy by 2030, and India pledged to achieve a 33 – 35% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030. 
Current and future legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could make lower GHG-emitting energy sources, such as solar and wind, more desirable than higher GHG-emitting energy sources, such as coal and natural gas. As a result, such climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions would potentially increase the demand for energy storage products. 
There are varying policy frameworks across the United States and abroad designed to support and accelerate adoption of clean and/or reliable distributed generation technologies. These policy initiatives come in the form of tax incentives, cash grants, performance incentives, and/or electric tariffs. 
Our energy storage products are currently installed or in delivery in Arizona, California, Colorado, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia, each of which has its own enabling policy framework. Some states have utility procurement programs and/or renewable portfolio standards for which our technology is eligible. Many states, including California, Massachusetts, and New York, offer tax exemptions or other customer incentives. These policy provisions are subject to change. 
Although we generally are not regulated as a utility, federal, state, and local government statutes and regulations concerning electricity heavily influence the market for our product and services. These statutes and regulations often relate to electricity pricing, net metering, incentives, taxation, competition with utilities and the interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. In the United States, governments continuously modify these statutes and regulations. Governments, often acting through state utility or public service commissions, change and adopt different rates for commercial (and residential) customers on a regular basis. These changes can have a positive or negative impact on our ability to deliver cost savings to customers for the purchase of electricity.

Several states have an energy storage mandate or policies designed to encourage the adoption of storage. For example, Virginia has a mandate for 3.1 GW of energy storage by 2035, California offers a cash rebate for storage installations through the Self Generation Incentive Program, and Massachusetts and New York offer performance-based financial incentives for storage. Storage installations also are supported in certain states by state public utility commission policies that require utilities to consider alternatives such as storage before they can build new generation. In February 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued Order 841 directing regional transmission operators and independent system operators to remove barriers to the participation of storage in wholesale electricity markets and to establish rules to help ensure storage resources are compensated for the services they provide. An appeal of Order 841 filed by utility trade associations and other parties challenging the extent of FERC’s jurisdiction over storage resources connected to distribution systems (among other issues) is currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In September 2020, the FERC issued Order 2222 opening U.S. wholesale energy markets to aggregations of distributed energy resources like rooftop solar, “behind the meter” batteries and electric vehicles. 
Energy storage products require interconnection agreements from the applicable authorities having jurisdiction to operate. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are typically required once interconnection agreements are signed. 
Permits and Approvals
Each of our installations or customer installations must be designed, constructed, and operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations, codes, standards, guidelines, policies, and laws. To install and operate energy storage products on our platform, we, our customers, or our partners, as applicable, are required to obtain applicable permits and approvals from local authorities having jurisdiction to install energy storage products and to interconnect the products with the local electrical utility. 
Government Incentives
The U.S. Congress is considering a variety of proposals for tax incentives that will benefit the energy storage industry, including in the form of tax credits. IRS private letter ruling 201809003 clarified that energy storage is eligible for federal tax credits if charged primarily by qualifying renewable resources. In December 2020, the U.S. Congress passed a spending bill that includes $35 billion in energy research and development programs, a two-year extension of the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for solar power, a one-year extension of the Production Tax Credit for wind power projects, and an extension through 2025 for offshore wind tax credits. In June 2021, the White House announced that it will look into dramatically expanding U.S. production of lithium batteries, rare earth minerals, and semiconductors, and seek to stimulate demand for domestically manufactured batteries by expanding federal energy storage procurement, expanding the ITC to include stationary energy storage as a standalone resource, and instituting power transmission regulatory reform to support renewable power and stationary energy storage. Also in June, the Senate passed a $250 billion bipartisan technology and manufacturing bill whose provisions included: (i) provide $52 billion to support domestic semiconductor manufacturing; and (ii) authorize $16.9 billion for the Department of Energy from FY22 to FY26 for research and development and energy-related supply chains in key technology areas. Proposals being considered by Congress include: (i) the establishment of an ITC for standalone energy storage (i.e., products not paired with a renewable resource); (ii) extension of the federal solar energy ITC for ten (10) more years, keeping the credit at 30% through 2029; (iii) the consolidation of 44 federal energy tax incentives into three provisions to award credits for clean electricity, lower-emitting transportation fuels and energy efficient offices and homes; and (iv) the allowance of renewable electricity production and investment tax credits to be transferred on a limited basis to any entity involved in a renewable energy project, regardless of whether they have taxable income. There can be no assurance that all or any of the above proposals will be adopted by the U.S. Congress.
