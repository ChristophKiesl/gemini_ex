Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 On February 24, 2021, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of  10,062,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”), for an aggregate price of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share. In June 2021, our Sponsor surrendered 1,437,500 Class B ordinary shares to the Company for no consideration, which we accepted and cancelled. In July 2021, our Sponsor surrendered an aggregate of 718,750 Founder Shares to the Company for no consideration, which we accepted and cancelled. In August 2021, our Sponsor forfeited 207,755 Founder Shares which we accepted and cancelled, and an aggregate of 207,755 Founder Shares were issued to our independent directors at their original purchase price. Our Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of 1,031,250 Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option for the Public Offering was not exercised in full by the underwriters. The underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full on August 11, 2021, and no Founder Shares were forfeited by our Sponsor. The holders of our Founder Shares (including our Sponsor and our independent directors) are referred to herein as our “initial shareholders.”
 
On the Closing Date, we consummated our Public Offering of 31,625,000 units, including the Over-allotment Units (as defined below). The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $316,250,000. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one warrant (“Warrant”). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 12,737,500 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.00 per Warrant to our Sponsor and our independent directors, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $12,737,500. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
 
In connection with the Public Offering, the underwriters of the Public Offering were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 4,125,000 units (the “Over-allotment Units”) at the Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On August 11, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full and purchased 4,125,000 Over-allotment Units at the closing of the Public Offering at an offering price of $10.00 per Over-allotment Unit, generating  proceeds of $41,250,000.
 
We received gross proceeds from the Public Offering (including the Over-allotment Units) and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of approximately $316.3 million and $12.7 million, respectively, for an aggregate of approximately $329 million. Approximately $319.4 million of the gross proceeds were deposited into a U.S. based trust account (the “Trust Account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (“Trustee”). The approximately $319.4 million of net proceeds held in the Trust Account includes approximately $11.1 million of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions that will be released to the underwriters of the Public Offering upon completion of our initial business combination. Of the gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants that were not deposited in the Trust Account, approximately $6.3 million was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions in the Public Offering, $410,684 was used to repay loans and advances from our Sponsor and the balance was reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence expenses on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. 
 
The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in our Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive 
 1

such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of our Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination). Holders of our Founder Shares may also elect to convert their Class B ordinary shares into an equal number of Class A ordinary shares, subject to adjustment as provided above, at any time.
 
On October 1, 2021, we announced that commencing on October 1, 2021, holders of the Units sold in our Public Offering may elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and Warrants included in the Units. The Class A ordinary shares and Warrants that are separated trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbols “DCRD” and “DCRDW,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol “DCRDU.”
 
Our Company
 
Our Sponsor is an affiliate of Riverstone, a Delaware limited liability that manages a family of private equity funds in the energy and power industry. Although we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry, we intend to capitalize on the Riverstone platform to identify, acquire and operate a business in industries that may provide opportunities for attractive risk-adjusted returns in one of the multiple sectors that may advance the objectives of global decarbonization. This includes the energy and agriculture, industrials, transportation and commercial and residential sectors. We believe these areas of focus represent a favorable and highly fragmented market opportunity to consummate a business combination.
 
We intend to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a hands-on owner with extensive transactional, financial, managerial and investment experience that presents potential for an attractive risk-adjusted return profile under our stewardship. Even fundamentally sound companies can often underperform their potential due to underinvestment, a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they operate, over-levered capital structures, excessive cost structures, incomplete management teams and/or inappropriate business strategies. Riverstone, an affiliate of our Sponsor, has extensive experience in identifying and executing acquisitions across the renewable, infrastructure, upstream and industrial services sectors, and has a two decade history of managing a portfolio of industrial assets that it believes must be at the core of a solutions roadmap to address climate change through decarbonizations.
 
We believe that we are well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that our contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, private equity funds and investment bankers, in addition to the industry reach of the Riverstone platform, will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities.
 
We continue to seek to capitalize on the expertise and industry relationships of Riverstone, our chief executive officer and board of directors to source and complete a business combination. Since 2000, Riverstone has raised over $40 billion across capital structure in all major components of the renewable and conventional energy, power and infrastructure markets, with exposure to over 195 portfolio companies in 15 countries. The firm maintains offices in New York, London, Houston, Menlo Park, Mexico City and Amsterdam. Together, our board of directors and management team has a demonstrable track record of identifying high-quality assets, businesses and management teams with significant resources, capital and optimization potential.
 
Robert Tichio and Jim McDermott serve as our chief executive officer and lead independent director, respectively. Messrs. Tichio and McDermott have significant backgrounds and experience as entrepreneurs and in the decarbonization investment space. Mr. Tichio has served as chairman of the board of directors and member of the audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees of Tritium since January 2022. Mr. Tichio is a partner and managing director of Riverstone Holdings LLC. Mr. Tichio joined the firm in 2006 and has been focused on the firm’s Private Equity business. Prior to joining Riverstone, Mr. Tichio was in the Principal Investment Area (PIA) of Goldman Sachs, which manages the firm’s private corporate equity investments. Mr. Tichio began his career at J.P. Morgan in the Mergers & Acquisition Group, where he concentrated on assignments that included public company combinations, asset sales, takeover defenses, and leveraged buyouts.

Mr. McDermott has over two decades of investment and entrepreneurship experience almost exclusively dedicated to the decarbonization and clean tech space. He is the founder of Stamps.com, and has co-founded and invested in over 35 other companies over 25 years including NanoH20, Molear, Carbon Engineering and US Renewables Group. He presently serves as the chief executive officer of Rusheen Capital Management, a Santa Monica-based private equity firm dedicated to investments in growth-stage companies in carbon capture and utilization, low-carbon energy and water sustainability sectors. He also serves as the chief executive officer of 1PointFive, which develops, builds, owns and operates Direct Air Capture and Sequestration (DAC+S) plants in the United States, which holds the U.S. exclusive license from Carbon Engineering for the buildout of DAC+S plants across the country, utilizing Carbon Engineering’s proprietary and patented technology. Mr. McDermott founded and is currently a board member of Fulcrum BioEnergy, whose purpose is to advance the decarbonization of transportation through the conversion of municipal solid waste to low-carbon transportation fuels.
 
In November 2015, Riverstone formed Silver Run Acquisition Corporation (“Silver Run I”), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purposes as our company. Silver Run I aimed to capitalize on the 45 years of experience in the oil and gas industry of its chief executive officer, Mark Papa. Prior to Silver Run I and his time with Riverstone, Mr. Papa was Chairman and chief executive officer of EOG Resources, an exploration and production company. Through its initial public offering in February 2016, Silver Run I raised $500 million from the sale of 50 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one warrant. On July 6, 2016, an affiliate of Riverstone entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an approximate 89% interest in Centennial Resource Production, LLC (“Centennial”), an independent oil and natural gas company with assets located in the core of the Southern Delaware Basin, from funds controlled by, and affiliates of, NGP Energy Capital Management, L.L.C. In accordance with the definitive agreement, the Riverstone affiliate agreed to assign, and Silver Run I agreed to assume, its right to purchase the interest in Centennial. On October 11, 2016, Silver Run I consummated the acquisition of approximately 89% of the outstanding membership interests in Centennial. In connection with the acquisition, Silver Run I raised an additional approximately $1.0 billion through a private placement of shares of its Class A common stock at $10.00 per share. Upon the closing of the transaction, Silver Run I was renamed Centennial Resource Development, Inc., and its common stock and warrants began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “CDEV” and “CDEVW”, respectively.
 In November 2016, Riverstone formed Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II (“Silver Run II”), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purposes as our company and Silver Run I. Through its initial public offering in March 2017, Silver Run II raised $1.035 billion from the sale of 103.5 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one third of one warrant. On February 9, 2018, Silver Run II consummated the acquisition of (i) all of the limited partnership interests in Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (“Alta Mesa”), (ii) 100% of the economic interests and 90% of the voting interests in Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, the sole general partner of Alta Mesa, and (iii) all of the membership interests in Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (“Kingfisher”). Following the business combination, Silver Run II was renamed “Alta Mesa Resources, Inc.” and its Class A common stock and warrants began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “AMR” and “AMRWW,” respectively.
 In March 2017, Riverstone formed Vista Oil & Gas, S.A.B. DE C.V. (“Vista”), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purposes as our company, Silver Run I and Silver Run II. Through its initial public offering in August 2017, Vista raised $650 million from the sale of 65 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of one Series A share and one warrant. On April 4, 2018, Vista consummated the acquisition of an oil and gas platform from Pampa Energía S.A. and Pluspetrol Resources Corporation with interests in certain exploitation concessions, assessment blocks and exploration permits in Argentina. Vista’s Class A shares trade on the Mexican Stock Exchange under the symbol “VISTA,” and Vista’s American Depositary Shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “VIST.”
 In September 2017, Riverstone formed Silver Run Acquisition Corporation III, a blank check company formed for substantially the same purpose as our company, Silver Run I, Silver Run II and Vista. On August 18, 2020, Silver Run Acquisition Corporation III officially changed its name to Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation (“Decarb I”). Through its initial public offering in October 2020, Decarb I raised $225.7 million from the sale of 22.5 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of one Class A common stock and one half of one warrant. Decarb I’s units, Class A common stock and warrants trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market 
 3

under the symbols “DCRBU,” “DCRB” and “DCRBW,” respectively. On February 9, 2021 Decarb I announced its initial business combination with Hyzon Motors Inc., the industry-leading global supplier of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell powered commercial vehicles. The transaction closed on July 16, 2021 and the combined entity is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “HYZN.”
 In December 2020, Riverstone formed Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation II (“Decarb II”), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purpose as our company, Silver Run I, Silver Run II, Vista and Decarb I. Through its initial public offering in February 2021, Decarb II raised $402.5 million from the sale of 40.25 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one third of one warrant. Decarb II’s units, Class A common stock and warrants trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “DCRNU,” “DCRN” and “DCRNW,” respectively. On May 26, 2021, Decarb II announced its initial business combination with Tritium Holdings Pty Ltd (“Tritium”), a global developer and manufacturer of direct current fast chargers for electric vehicles. The transaction closed on January 13, 2022 and the combined entity is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “DCFC.” 
 In January 2021, Riverstone formed Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation III (“Decarb III”), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purpose as our company, Silver Run I, Silver Run II, Vista, Decarb I and Decarb II. Through its initial public offering in March 2021, Decarb III raised $350 million from the sale of 35.0 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one third of one warrant. Decarb III’s units, Class A common stock and warrants trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “DCRCU,” “DCRC” and “DCRCW,” respectively. On June 15, 2021, Decarb III announced its initial business combination with Solid Power, Inc., an industry leading producer of next-generation all-solid state batteries for electric vehicles. The transaction closed on December 8, 2021 and the combined entity is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “SLDP.”
 In February 2021, Riverstone formed Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation IV (“Decarb IV”), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purpose as our company, Silver Run I, Silver Run II, Vista, Decarb I, Decarb II and Decarb III. Through its initial public offering in August 2021, Decarb IV raised approximately $316 million from the sale of approximately 31.6 million units to public investors, with each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant. Decarb IV’s units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “DCRDU,” “DCRD” and “DCRDW,” respectively. 
 In February 2021, Riverstone formed Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation V (“Decarb V”), a blank check company formed for substantially the same purpose as our company, Silver Run I, Silver Run II, Vista, Decarb I, Decarb II, Decarb III and Decarb IV. Upon completion of its initial public offering, Decarb V’s units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants will trade on NASDAQ under the symbols “DCREU,” “DCRE” and “DCREW,” respectively.
 Riverstone is one of the most experienced private equity investors globally within renewable energy, with over 15 years of dedicated investment experience to renewables. Since inception, Riverstone has committed over $5.2 billion of capital to 14 renewable power platform investments across subsectors including power generation, transmission & distribution, services and supply chain. Riverstone has owned or developed nearly 14 gigawatts of generation capacity and has developed over 110 projects in 15 countries. Further, Riverstone has raised significant funds for decarbonization and renewables platforms following the emergence of the coronavirus and its impact on the global economy and financial markets. In 2020, Riverstone raised $1 billion of equity for the recapitalization of Enviva Holdings, the world’s largest producer of sustainable wood pellets, and completed a $6.1 billion take-private of Pattern Energy Group, one of the world’s largest companies dedicated to carbon-free electricity through the development of utility scale wind and solar power facilities.
 
With respect to the foregoing examples, past performance of Riverstone or our management team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of Riverstone’s or our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance.
 
Business Strategy
 
4


Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company whose principal effort is developing and advancing a platform that decarbonizes the most carbon-intensive sectors, including the energy and agriculture, industrials, transportation and commercial and residential sectors. To date, decarbonization investment dollars have taken place mostly on the grid, with investments in electricity conversions or substitutions from coal, oil and natural gas to renewables, principally wind and solar, while decarbonization initiatives around transportation have accelerated but are still in their infancy. Riverstone believes that the addressable universe to achieve substantial reductions in the global carbon footprint must extend beyond electricity and transportation. The electric grid accounts for less than 25% of primary energy consumption, while in the transportation market, the global adoption of electric vehicles has been slow to accelerate (in 2019, the electric vehicle share of global light vehicle purchases was 2.5% versus 1.2% in 2017). Meanwhile, the legacy global industrial, urban and agriculture complex remains largely under-resourced in terms of investments dollars expressly seeking measurable improvements in carbon intensity, and the application of digitization to industrial processes or supply chains provides enormous improvement potential in the carbon emissions profile of the global economy. Our acquisition strategy will leverage Riverstone’s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience in the renewable and energy industries could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses or properties. Our goal is to build a focused business with multiple competitive advantages that have the potential to improve the target business’s overall value proposition. We plan to utilize the network and industry experience of our management team and Riverstone in seeking an initial business combination and employing our acquisition strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. In addition to industry and lending community relationships, we plan to leverage relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, restructuring advisers, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. Members of our management team are communicating with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target business and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads.
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses that we believe:

● | are fundamentally sound but that we believe can improve results by leveraging the transactional, financial, managerial and investment experience of our management team and Riverstone;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | can utilize the extensive networks and insights that our management team and Riverstone have built in the renewable infrastructure and energy industry;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, 
 5

factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials that we would file with the SEC.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. Our board will make the determination as to the fair market value of a target business or businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion, nor will they be able to rely on such opinion.
 
We may pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with our Sponsor, or one or more of its affiliates, which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuance of equity or equity-linked securities would, on a fully diluted basis, reduce the percentage ownership of our then-existing shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B ordinary shares, issuances or deemed issuances of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities would result in an adjustment to the ratio at Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares  such that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of our Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. Our Sponsor and its affiliates have no obligation to make any such investment, and may compete with us for potential business combinations.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders, or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for seeking shareholder approval or for purposes of a tender offer, as applicable.

Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our transactional, financial, managerial and investment experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view.
 
Riverstone, members of our management team and our independent directors own (directly or indirectly) Founder Shares and/or Private Placement Warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. In addition, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
In addition, Riverstone or its affiliates, including our officers and directors who are affiliated with Riverstone, may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination, and members of our management team may participate in such blank check companies. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among the management teams. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
Our Management Team
 
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
 
We believe our management team’s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies provides us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market 
 7

conditions. See “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for a more complete description of our management team’s experience.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our ordinary shares or for a combination of our ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or 
 8

used for redemptions of purchases of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. We may, at our option, pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such entity.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test.
 
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or 
 9

business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
 
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The Company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
 Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
 
10


We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
 
Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 
 
● | we issue Class A ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our Class A ordinary shares then outstanding;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Permitted Purchases of our Securities
 
In the event we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or Warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.
 
In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of Warrants could be to reduce the number of Warrants outstanding or to vote such Warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or Warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
11


Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against the initial business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) of and Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) of or Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per-share amount that we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions we will pay to the underwriters of the Public Offering. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares held by them and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with 
 12

the Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless shareholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

 
● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulations the solicitation of proxies. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NASDAQ listing or Exchange Act registration.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will:
 
 
● | Conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | File proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval at an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands Law. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding representing one third (1/3) of the voting power of all outstanding ordinary shares of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial shareholders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ Founder Shares, in respect of an ordinary resolution, we would need 37.5% of the then outstanding public shares to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved. We intend to give 
 13

approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in our Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in our Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will not restrict our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we will have 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination within such 18-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 18-month time period.
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Public Offering. However, if our Sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after the Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 18-month time period.
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our Public Offering or (ii) with respect to any other 
 14

provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay franchise and income taxes on interest income earned on the Trust Account balance, we may request the Trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.10. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to seek access to the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. 
 
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.10 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None 
 15

of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.10 per public share.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $1,250,000 from the proceeds of the Public Offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
If we file a winding up petition or a winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable insolvency law, and a liquidator may determine that such funds should be included in our insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third-party creditors with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a winding up petition or a winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be subject to challenge under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a “voidable preference.” As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of our Public Offering, subject to applicable law, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.

Limited Payments to Insiders
 
There will be no finder’s fees, reimbursements or cash payments made by the Company to our Sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:

● | repayment of up to an aggregate of $300,000 in loans made to us by our Sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reimbursement for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative services made available to us by our Sponsor or an affiliate thereof, in an amount equal to $10,000 per month;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | repayment of loans made by our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
Our executive offices are located at 2744 Sand Hill Road, Suite 100, Menlo Park, CA 94025, and our telephone number is (212) 993-0076. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay to reimburse our Sponsor or an affiliate thereof for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support made available to us. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Human Capital Resources
 
We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
17


We have registered our Units, Class A ordinary shares and Warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), or reconciled to, GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
