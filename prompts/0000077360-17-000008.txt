• | expanding multi-channel distribution; and


• | proactively managing our business portfolio for optimal value creation, including consideration of new business platforms.

Unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to "Pentair," the "Company," and such words as "we," "us," and "our" include Pentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are an Irish public limited company that was formed in 2014. We are the successor to Pentair Ltd., a Swiss corporation formed in 2012, and Pentair, Inc., a Minnesota corporation formed in 1966 and our wholly-owned subsidiary, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT
In December 2013, the Company's Board of Directors approved changing the Company's jurisdiction of organization from Switzerland to Ireland. At an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on May 20, 2014, Pentair Ltd. shareholders voted in favor of a reorganization proposal pursuant to which Pentair Ltd. would merge into Pentair plc and all Pentair Ltd. common shares would be cancelled and all holders of such shares would receive ordinary shares of Pentair plc on a one-to-one basis. The reorganization transaction was completed on June 3, 2014, at which time Pentair plc replaced Pentair Ltd. as the ultimate parent company (the "Redomicile"). Shares of Pentair plc began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on June 3, 2014 under the symbol "PNR," the same symbol under which Pentair Ltd. shares were previously traded.
Although our jurisdiction of organization is Ireland, we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") and therefore have our tax residency in the U.K. 
Our former parent company, Pentair Ltd., took its form on September 28, 2012 as a result of a reverse acquisition (the "Merger") involving Pentair, Inc. and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Flow Control (defined below), with Pentair, Inc. surviving as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. "Flow Control" refers to Pentair Ltd. prior to the Merger. Prior to the Merger, Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco") engaged in an internal restructuring whereby it transferred to Flow Control certain assets related to the flow control business of Tyco, and Flow Control assumed from Tyco certain liabilities related to the flow control business of Tyco. On September 28, 2012 prior to the Merger, Tyco effected a spin-off of Flow Control through the pro-rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Flow Control to Tyco's shareholders (the "Distribution"), resulting in the distribution of approximately 110.9 million of our ordinary shares to Tyco's shareholders. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting with Pentair, Inc. treated as the acquirer.

On September 18, 2015, we acquired, as part of Technical Solutions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of ERICO Global Company ("ERICO") for approximately $1.8 billion (the "ERICO Acquisition"). ERICO is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of engineered electrical and fastening products for electrical, mechanical and civil applications. ERICO has employees in 30 countries across the world with recognized brands including CADDY fixing, fastening and support products; ERICO electrical grounding, bonding and connectivity products and LENTON engineered systems.
On August 18, 2016, we entered into a share purchase agreement to sell our Valves & Controls business to Emerson Electric Co. for a purchase price of $3.15 billion in cash, subject to customary adjustments. We believe the sale will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions. The results of the Valves and Controls business have been presented as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. The Valves & Controls business was previously disclosed as a stand-alone reporting segment.
Our registered principal office is located at 43 London Wall, London, EC2M 5TF, United Kingdom. Our management office in the United States ("U.S.") is located at 5500 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 600, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

NEW SEGMENTATION
During the first quarter of 2017, we reorganized our business segments to reflect a new operating structure, resulting in a change to our reporting segments in 2017. As part of this reorganization, the legacy Water Quality Systems business segment was combined with the legacy Flow & Filtration Solutions business segment to form the Water reporting segment and now operates as a stand-alone business segment. In addition, the legacy Technical Solutions business segment will be renamed the Electrical reporting segment. All segment information presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, with exception of the table below, was prepared based on the reporting segments in place during 2016.
The below table presents sales and segment income under the revised reporting segments (Water and Electrical) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

INFORMATION REGARDING ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Backlog of orders by segment

 | December 31
In millions | 2016 | 2015 | $ change | % change
Water Quality Systems | $ | 134.8 | | $ | 141.4 | | $ | (6.6 | ) | (4.7 | )%
Flow and Filtration Solutions | 241.0 | | 289.6 | | (48.6 | ) | (16.8 | )

Total | $ | 642.1 | | $ | 750.0 | | $ | (107.9 | ) | (14.4 | )%

A substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product delivered in the same month. Our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order.  However, a portion of our backlog, particularly from orders for major capital projects, can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order. We record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. We expect the majority of our backlog at December 31, 2016 will be shipped in 2017.
Research and development
We conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities. These efforts consist primarily of the development of new products, product applications and manufacturing processes. Research and development expenditures during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $114.1 million, $98.7 million and $96.4 million, respectively.
Environmental
Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7 and ITEM 8, Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Raw materials
The principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels.
We purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in the future.
Intellectual property
Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trademark, trade name or brand name.
Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 26,000 people worldwide, of which 9,500 were in the U.S. and 9,000 were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. Of the 26,000 people employed worldwide as of December 31, 2016, 7,500 relate to our Valves & Controls business classified as held for sale, of which 1,500 were in the U.S. and 2,200 were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. We believe that our relations with the labor unions have generally been good.
Captive insurance subsidiary
We insure certain general and product liability, property, workers' compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald Insurance Company ("Penwald"). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain non-U.S. operations are established.
Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Insurance subsidiary, included in this Form 10-K.
Available information
We make available free of charge (other than an investor's own Internet access charges) through our Internet website (http://www.pentair.com) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
