Item 1. Business
Overview and History 
ASGN Incorporated ("ASGN," "we," or "us") is one of the foremost providers of information technology (IT) and professional services in the technology, digital, creative, engineering and life sciences fields across commercial and government sectors. We operate through three segments: Apex, Oxford and ECS. Our Apex segment provides technology, digital, creative, scientific, engineering staffing and consulting services to Fortune 1000 and mid-market commercial clients across the United States and Canada. Our Oxford segment provides hard-to-find technology, digital, engineering and life sciences staffing and consulting services, in select skill and geographic markets in the United States and Europe. Our ECS segment delivers advanced solutions in cloud, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, application and IT modernization, science and engineering. ECS has built successful customer relationships with some of the world’s leading federal, state and local government agencies.
We have grown through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Over the last three years, we acquired ECS Federal, LLC ("ECS") in April 2018 and six "tuck-in" acquisitions that aligned with our strategy to expand our IT consulting and solutions capabilities in the commercial and federal government markets for both our Federal Government business, which is our ECS segment, and our Commercial business, which is comprised of our Apex and Oxford segments. 
Commercial Business
Our Commercial business provides a broad spectrum of IT, technology, digital, creative, scientific, engineering staffing and consulting services to Fortune 1000 and mid-market clients across the United States, Canada and Europe. Contracts range from approximately one week to one year in length. Corporate support activities are based in Richmond, Virginia; Beverly, Massachusetts; Los Angeles, California and Irvine, California, with over 120 branch offices across the United States, and certain foreign locations including Mexico, Canada and Europe. Some of the divisions within this business operate under the Apex Systems, Creative Circle, Oxford and CyberCoders trademarks.
Assignment — Our assignment services group provides experienced IT, engineering, regulatory compliance, life sciences, advertising and digital marketing consultants to clients for temporary assignments and project engagements. Our consultants typically have a great deal of knowledge and experience in specialized technical or creative fields, which make them uniquely qualified to fill a given assignment or project. 
Consulting — Our IT consulting services group provides workforce mobilization, modern enterprise and digital innovation deliverables-based consulting services. Our consultants and subject matter experts deliver solutions that are customer focused and value driven. From requirements definition to full managed services, we provide a continuum of cloud, data and analytics, and digital transformation solutions to support our clients’ modern enterprise and digital needs, across the full life cycle. 
Federal Government Business
Our Federal Government business delivers advanced solutions in cloud, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, application and IT modernization, science and engineering to some of the world's leading agencies in both the public and private sectors. Our team of skilled experts tackle critical and highly complex challenges for customers in the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, federal civilian agencies and state and local government, education and commercial customers. We maintain premier partnerships with leading cloud, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence/machine learning providers and hold specialized certifications in these technologies. 
We have a backlog of awarded contracts of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2020, which represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under awarded contracts including task orders and options. For a further discussion of contract backlog see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Industry and Market Dynamics
ASGN delivers staffing and consulting services in the technology, digital, creative, engineering and life sciences fields across commercial and government sectors. ASGN helps leading corporate enterprises and government organizations develop, implement and operate critical IT and business solutions through its integrated offering of professional staffing and IT consulting services. 
In March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization ("WHO"). As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our commercial business began experiencing week-to-week declines in revenues beginning in late March 2020, which continued through the first half of the second quarter. Beginning in mid-May, week-to-week revenues began to improve steadily, which has continued into 2021. Over the same period, our Federal Government business experienced double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. 
The Staffing Industry Analysts' ("SIA") U.S. Staffing Industry Forecast (September 2020 Update) found that the COVID-19 pandemic brought an end to a decade of sustained growth in the U.S. staffing industry, with a 17 percent decline in overall revenue in 2020. IT staffing was down nine percent in 2020 but has been one of the most resilient staffing segment through the pandemic due to a high capacity for IT temporary staffing to support remote work; an agile, flexible IT workforce becoming a greater priority and the escalating pace of digital transformations across industries. The SIA projects that IT staffing will increase by seven percent in 2021 and that the staffing industry, as a whole, would recover along with the economy to grow 12 percent to $141.5 billion in 2021. Our ECS acquisition in 2018 expanded our addressable end market as we now compete in the federal government IT services and solutions sector, which was not impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our addressable market is approximately $319.7 billion, which includes $31.7 billion in IT staffing, $120.0 billion in IT consulting and $168.0 billion in government IT services and solutions.

We anticipate that our clients will increase their use of contract labor, professional staffing and consulting services in 2021. By using our contract labor and professional staffing services, our clients benefit from cost structure advantages, flexibility to address fluctuating demand in business and access to greater expertise. Our business model continues to evolve in line with client needs and expectations to focus on higher-end, higher-margin IT consulting services and solutions capabilities, particularly those related to digital transformation. We will continue to grow our diverse client base by focusing on large, stable accounts that are quicker adopters of new technologies. We will invest in our organic growth, and we will look to execute acquisitions in the commercial and federal government end markets that provide us with new solution capabilities, industry expertise or contract vehicles.
Clients
We serve our clients by effectively understanding their IT and consulting services needs and providing them qualified professionals with a unique combination of skills, experience and expertise to meet those needs. We believe effective engagements of contract IT, engineering, digital, creative and scientific professionals require the people involved in making assignments to have significant knowledge of the client’s industry and the ability to assess the specific needs of the client as well as the contract professional’s qualifications. In 2020, revenues from different departments and agencies of the U.S. federal government were approximately 23.5 percent of consolidated revenues and no other client represented more than ten percent of revenues. Approximately 95.6 percent of our revenues are generated in the United States.
Our clients set rigorous requirements for the talent they are seeking, and we use our extensive databases and deep relationships with our contract professionals to quickly identify and pre-screen candidates whose qualifications meet those requirements. We are responsible for recruiting, verifying credentials upon request, hiring, administering pay and benefits, compliance and training, as applicable. Clients select the candidate, provide on-the-job supervision and approve hours worked, as applicable. 
Candidates
We recruit candidates with backgrounds in IT, digital, creative, engineering and life sciences who seek contract work opportunities. When we place these candidates on assignments or consulting projects with clients, they become our employees. Many of these contract professionals, and those we place via subcontractors, are paid hourly wage or contract rates based on their specific skills and whether or not the assignment involves travel away from their primary residence. We pay the related costs of employment including social security taxes, federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other similar costs for our employees. After achieving minimum service periods and/or hours worked, our contract professionals are offered access to medical and other voluntary benefit programs (e.g., dental, vision, disability) and the right to participate in our 401(k) retirement savings plan. Each contract professional’s employment relationship with us is terminable at will. We placed approximately 51,000 contract professionals throughout 2020.
Strategy
ASGN's strategy is to identify, enter and be a significant player in the most attractive subsectors of the IT and professional staffing and consulting services markets through both organic and acquisitive growth. We continue to specialize in the large and growing technology, engineering, digital, creative and life sciences markets, reinforce our position as a significant competitor in each, advance our pursuit of the IT services market with our professional staffing services, invest primarily in domestic markets and pursue additional acquisitions that support our differentiated resource deployment model.
Our strategic innovation efforts and technology investments focus on putting the best productivity tools in the hands of our recruiters, our candidates and our clients, making it easy for clients and consultants to work with ASGN. We respond to emerging trends in digitization and candidate sourcing to better position our businesses and improve how we serve clients and consultants.
We consolidate our corporate support services (finance, accounting, human resources, legal, marketing and IT) in centralized locations where we can most effectively and efficiently perform these functions, allowing us to leverage our fixed costs and generate higher incremental earnings as our revenues grow. In addition, we invest in leasehold improvements as we expand, relocate and rationalize our branch facilities to increase the productivity of our consultants. 
Competition
We compete with other large publicly held and privately owned providers of human capital in the professional staffing and IT consulting services segments on a local, regional, national and international basis across commercial and government sectors.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified candidates for contract placements are contract rates, salaries and benefits; availability and variety of opportunities; quality, duration and location of assignments; and responsiveness to requests for placement. Many people seeking contract employment through us are also pursuing employment through other means, including other human capital providers. Therefore, the speed at which we assign prospective professionals and the availability of attractive and appropriate assignments are important factors in our ability to fill open positions. In addition to having high-quality candidates to assign in a timely manner, the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients are properly assessing the clients’ specific job and project requirements, the appropriateness of the professional assigned to the client, the price of services and monitoring our clients’ satisfaction. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we expect competition to continue to increase.
Human Capital
People are the core of ASGN. Our diverse talent pool helps build a strong workforce and maintain the our competitive advantage. At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,200 internal employees, including staffing consultants, regional sales directors, account managers, recruiters and corporate office employees. We support our employees and consultants through the following initiatives:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion — As of December 31, 2019, our internal workforce was 48 percent women, 30 percent non-white and 60 percent between the ages of 25 to 54. In 2020, ASGN established new diversity, equity and inclusion training, recruitment, retention and advancement programs, which include mandatory training to raise awareness and eliminate unconscious bias in hiring and promotion practices. Apex Systems has a diversity leadership and a Women@Apex program, which are designed to encourage personal and professional development for employees from all ethnicities, races, religions and backgrounds and to start conversations and empower women at all levels to speak up and be a part of the business. We are working to implement similar programs across the Company.
Work Practices and Employee Well-Being — Our training and development opportunities address, among other things, ethics and integrity; diversity and workplace inclusion; discrimination and harassment; unconscious bias; cybersecurity, privacy and information security; and workplace safety. We reward employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages, including medical, dental and vision plans; short- and long-term disability; life and accident insurance; health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts; and savings plans.
Employee Engagement, Retention and Development — We are committed to career advancement through training and development that supports both personal and professional growth. Employees are provided with a comprehensive training program of continued education that helps them stay ahead and deliver excellent results, including continued education and professional development. To promote more employee engagement in areas that are most meaningful to our diverse array of employees in 2021, we are supporting the development of Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") such as the following ERGs: Black Women, Interfaith, Environmental Sustainability, Parents and Caregivers, and Prism (LGBTQ+).
Collaborative Performance Management — We strongly support the belief that our employees should be the primary drivers of their own career growth. Employees are encouraged to seek opportunities that align with their long-term career goals, whether that be lateral job changes, cross-functional training, serving on committees or special projects, or any activity that will help to progress their career. Our performance management process emphasizes clear goals with timely and constructive feedback.

Government Regulation

We take reasonable steps to ensure that our contract professionals possess all current licenses and certifications required for each placement. We provide state-mandated workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment insurance and professional liability insurance for our internal employees and our contract professionals who are our employees. These expenses have a direct effect on our costs of services, margins and likelihood of achieving or maintaining profitability.
