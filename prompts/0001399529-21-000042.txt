ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “Dicerna”) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing medicines that are designed to leverage ribonucleic acid interference (“RNAi”) to silence selectively genes that cause or contribute to disease. Using our proprietary GalXC™ and GalXC-Plus™ RNAi technologies, Dicerna is committed to developing RNAi-based therapies with the potential to treat both rare and more prevalent diseases. By silencing disease-causing genes, Dicerna’s GalXC platform has the potential to address conditions that are difficult to treat with other modalities. Initially focused on disease-causing genes in the liver, Dicerna has continued to innovate and is exploring new applications of its RNAi technology with GalXC-Plus, which expands on the functionality and application of our flagship liver-based GalXC technology, yet has the potential to treat diseases across multiple therapeutic areas. In addition to our own pipeline of core discovery and clinical candidates, Dicerna has established collaborative relationships with some of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies, including Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo”), Roche, Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its affiliates, “Alexion”), Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (“BI”), and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Alnylam”). Between Dicerna and our collaborative partners, we currently have more than 20 active discovery, preclinical, or clinical programs focused on rare, cardiometabolic, viral, chronic liver, and complement-mediated diseases, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and pain.
Most of our drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi, a highly potent, natural, and specific mechanism that can be directed to reduce expression of a target gene. In this naturally occurring biological process, a short, synthetic, double-stranded RNA duplex induces the enzymatic destruction of the messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) of a target gene that contains sequences complementary to one strand of a double-stranded RNA. Our approach is to design proprietary RNA molecules that have the potential to engage the enzyme Dicer and direct the endogenous cellular RNAi machinery to silence a specific therapeutic target gene. Our GalXC technology utilizes a proprietary N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (“GalNAc”)-mediated conjugate to cause the liver to efficiently internalize our synthetic RNA molecules. In contrast, our GalXC-Plus technology incorporates new chemistries and secondary structures to enable targeting of genes in tissues and cell types beyond the liver. Our current clinical programs utilize the GalXC technology. Our GalXC-Plus technology utilizes modified RNA structures and various fully-synthetic conjugated ligands to deliver to non-liver tissues and is used in a number of our preclinical programs. Due to the enzymatic nature of RNAi, a single GalXC or GalXC-Plus molecule incorporated into the RNAi machinery can direct the cleavage and silencing of hundreds or thousands of mRNAs from the targeted gene.
Strategy
We are committed to delivering transformative therapies based on our GalXC platform to patients with serious diseases, and currently our focus includes rare, cardiometabolic, viral, chronic liver, and complement-mediated diseases, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and pain. We and our collaborators have identified dozens of disease-associated genes with the potential to treat clinical indications in which an RNAi-based inhibitor may provide substantial benefit to patients.
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
•Create new programs in disease indications with high unmet medical need. We intend to continue to use our proprietary GalXC and GalXC-Plus RNAi technologies to create new, high-value pharmaceutical programs. Our areas of primary focus are: (1) rare inherited diseases involving genes in the liver; (2) other therapeutic areas involving the expression of therapeutic gene targets in the liver such as chronic liver diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and viral infectious diseases; and (3) leveraging our GalXC-Plus constructs to explore therapeutic gene targets in complement-mediated diseases, as well as diseases impacting the central nervous system (“CNS”), adipose cells, skeletal muscle, and other tissues.
•Validate our product candidates and our platform in clinical proof-of-concept studies. In September 2018, we declared attainment of clinical proof-of-concept for nedosiran, which is in clinical development for primary hyperoxaluria (“PH”) type 1 (“PH1”), PH type 2 (“PH2”), and PH type 3 (“PH3”). In November 2020, we announced clinical proof-of-concept data and are currently conducting a clinical study for RG6346 for chronic hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) infection. We are planning to initiate a Phase 2 trial of belcesiran (formerly DCR-A1AT) in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin (“AAT”) deficiency-associated liver disease (“AATLD”) in the first half of 2021. Based on precedent in the RNAi field, we are optimistic that our preclinical studies, which showed significant knockdown (i.e., reduction in the expression) of target mRNA activity and disease biomarker activity, may translate into beneficial clinical results for current and future programs.
•Retain significant portions of the commercial rights for select disease programs. We seek to retain, subject to the evaluation of potential licensing opportunities as they may arise, full or substantial ownership stake and to invest internally in select programs, including diseases with focused patient populations, such as certain rare diseases. Our nedosiran and belcesiran programs represent opportunities that we believe carry a higher probability of success relative to other therapeutic platforms or modalities, with genetically and molecularly defined disease markers, high unmet medical need, and a focused number of centers of excellence to facilitate reaching these patients.
•Lead United States (“U.S.”) commercialization efforts for select programs. Subject to marketing approval, we intend to lead U.S. commercialization efforts for nedosiran internally. In order to expand our sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities beyond the U.S., we plan to out-license commercialization rights to nedosiran through a collaboration with a third party. Under our RG6346 collaboration with Roche, we have an option to co-fund the development of products under the agreement in exchange for high-twenties to mid-thirties royalty rates on net sales of products in the U.S. As part of our belcesiran collaboration agreement with Alnylam, Alnylam has the opportunity to opt in to commercialize belcesiran in countries outside the U.S. Should Alnylam exercise this option, they will pay us royalties related to those territories. We seek to retain all or a substantial portion of ownership of U.S. commercial rights to future pipeline programs in both rare and prevalent diseases.
•Enter into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies with either GalXC or GalXC-Plus RNAi technologies for specific indications or therapeutic areas. For more complex diseases with multiple gene dysfunctions and/or larger patient populations, we plan to pursue collaborations that can provide the enhanced scale, resources, and commercial infrastructure required to maximize these prospects. Our collaborations with Roche, Novo, Lilly, Alexion, BI, and Alnylam exemplify this element of our strategy. We may establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies across multiple programs or specific disease areas, either before or after clinical proof-of-concept, depending on the attractiveness of the opportunities. These collaborations have the potential to provide us with further validation of our RNAi technology platform, funding to advance our proprietary product candidates, or access to development, manufacturing, and commercial capabilities.
•Expand the reach of our RNAi technology to therapeutic targets beyond the liver. Using our GalXC-Plus technology, we are expanding to target diverse tissues and cell types outside the liver, including the CNS, muscle tissue, adipose tissue, tumors-associated immune cells, and other tissues. Our collaboration with Lilly includes joint research projects to develop new platform technologies for neurodegenerative diseases and chronic pain, as well as for a limited number of non-liver-based cardiometabolic diseases. We are also pursuing research internally to expand the reach of GalXC-Plus technology in other diverse tissues and are increasing our investment in this area. 
•Leverage the experience and the expertise of our executive management team. To execute on our strategy, we have assembled an executive management team that has extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, various members of our management team and our Board of Directors have contributed to the progress of pharmaceutical development and commercialization through their substantial involvement in companies such as Cephalon Inc., Genta Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Shire plc, Pfizer Inc., Novartis International AG, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Biogen, Inc., Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sirna”), and other companies. 
Development Approach
In choosing which development programs to advance internally, we apply the scientific, clinical, and commercial criteria listed below that we believe allow us to best leverage our RNAi platform and maximize value. We believe that our current development programs meet many or all of these criteria:
•    Strength of therapeutic hypothesis. We seek to target genes where an RNAi approach to treatment is likely to have substantial benefit for the patient.
•    Readily-identified patient population. We seek disease indications where patients can be identified readily by the presence of characteristic genetic mutations or other readily-accessible disease features. In the case of genetic diseases, these are heritable genetic mutations that can be identified with available routine genetic tests.
•    Predictivity of biomarkers for early efficacy assessment. We seek these markers to allow us to determine in early stages of clinical development whether our molecules are likely to have the expected biological and clinical effects in patients.
•    High unmet medical need. We seek to provide patients with significant benefit and alleviation of disease. The indications we choose to approach have high unmet medical need. The selection of these indications is intended to enable us to better access patients and qualify for pricing and reimbursement that justify our development efforts.
•    Rapid development path to proof-of-concept or approval. We seek indications with the potential for rapid development to proof-of-concept or marketing approval in order to reach commercialization expeditiously and to help ensure our ability to finance development of our product candidates. When appropriate, we will seek orphan designation, fast track designation, Breakthrough Therapy Designation, as well as other expedited programs from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), or similar designations or expedited programs from foreign regulatory authorities. A breakthrough therapy is a drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. 
The Dicerna Pipeline 
In choosing which development programs to advance internally, we apply the scientific, clinical, and commercial criteria that we believe allow us to best leverage our GalXC RNAi platform and maximize value. Using our GalXC RNAi technology, and applying the criteria of our development focus, we have created a pipeline of core liver-focused therapeutic programs for development by Dicerna. For opportunities that were not selected as a core program opportunity, we have sought partners to fund the discovery, and subsequently drive the development of, these non-core opportunities in exchange for upfront payments, milestone payments, royalties on product sales, and potentially other economic and operational arrangements. Our current collaborations with Novo, Lilly, Alexion, and BI resulted from this effort. For core programs targeting rare diseases, we intend to develop these programs internally through approval using GalXC and GalXC-Plus technologies, subject to collaborative opportunities that arise, such as our agreement with Alnylam. For core programs targeting larger populations, we may seek development partners, such as our collaboration with Roche on RG6346, under various economic and operational arrangements. Together, our core program pipeline and our pipeline of non-core collaborative programs constitute a broad and growing therapeutic pipeline that we believe may result in multiple valuable approved products based on our GalXC and GalXC-Plus technologies.
In addition to the programs listed in our pipeline, we are exploring a variety of potential programs involving gene targets in diverse tissues addressable with our GalXC and GalXC-Plus technologies. Some of these programs may be elevated in the future to be either a core program or a non-core collaborative program. Under our collaborations with Novo, Roche, and Lilly, our collaborators have rights to nominate additional programs for discovery by Dicerna and subsequent development by the nominating collaborator, which will become part of our non-core pipeline. In the case of our collaboration with Novo, we retain rights to opt in to deeper participation, including enhanced economic rights, at defined points in clinical development, for two programs nominated by Novo.
Our four current core GalXC development programs are: nedosiran for the treatment of PH, RG6346 for the treatment of HBV infection, belcesiran for the treatment of AATLD, and DCR-AUD for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (“AUD”).
We conduct clinical trials in various countries around the world, including the U.S. and other areas heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current supply of our investigational medicines is sufficient to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. Based on current evaluations, our supply chain continues to appear intact to meet at least the next 12 months of clinical, nonclinical, and chemistry, manufacturing, and control (“CMC”) supply demands across all programs. We have undertaken efforts to mitigate potential future impacts to the supply chain by increasing our stock of critical starting materials required to meet our needs and our collaborative partners’ needs through 2021 and by identifying and engaging alternative suppliers. In 2020, there were delays related to several nedosiran PHYOX trials and the belcesiran clinical trial in healthy volunteers as a result of COVID-19. As a result, and based on the most recent updates from clinical sites impacted by COVID-19 and precautionary measures related to the pandemic, we regularly evaluate our expectations related to clinical development milestones.
The table below sets forth the stage of development of our various GalXC RNAi platform product candidates as of February 25, 2021: 
RNAi and Our GalXC Platform
The RNAi Therapeutic Modality
Most of our drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi. RNAi therapeutics represent a novel advance in drug development. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry had developed only small molecules or monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the activity of disease-associated proteins. While this approach is effective for many diseases, many proteins cannot be inhibited by either small molecules or antibodies. The unique advantage of RNAi is that, instead of targeting proteins, RNAi silences the genes themselves via the targeted destruction of the mRNAs made from the gene. Rather than seeking to inhibit a protein directly, the RNAi approach is to prevent its creation in the first place, thus impacting the disease state.
The GalXC RNAi Platform
Dicerna’s GalXC platform consists of our liver-targeted GalXC technology and our GalXC-Plus technology for tissues outside the liver. Each utilizes a set of proprietary double-stranded RNA structures capable of inducing RNAi and associated chemical modifications and additions to these structures that enhance their properties and help confer useful “drug-like” properties. Our RNAi-inducing RNA structures consist of two strands of RNA. One of these strands, called the guide strand, is complementary to the mRNA sequence of the gene one is seeking to inhibit. The other strand, called the passenger strand, includes sequences complementary to the guide strand, forming a double-stranded RNA duplex with it. In the case of our GalXC and GalXC-Plus technologies, additional sequences may be added to the passenger strand, including a four-base sequence, known as a tetraloop, which is designed to enhance stability and engineer out immunostimulatory activity and can serve as an attachment point for various chemical additions that can facilitate delivery to diverse tissues. 
We believe our GalXC RNAi platform provides the following qualities and has advantages compared to other therapeutic modalities:
•    Our GalXC molecules have been optimized for use in humans. For therapeutic use in humans, our GalXC platform molecules are optimized both with respect to base sequence and chemical modifications to increase stability and mask them from mechanisms that recognize foreign RNA, in order to avoid inducing immune system stimulation. 
•Our GalXC technology enables subcutaneous dosing for delivery to the liver. The GalXC RNAi technology is designed to enable convenient subcutaneous delivery for our growing pipeline of liver-targeted RNAi programs. Our liver-targeted GalXC molecules are conjugated on the tetraloop structure to a simple sugar, GalNAc, that is specifically recognized by a receptor on the surface of hepatocytes. With the liver-targeted GalXC technology, a full human dose may be administered via a single subcutaneous injection. After injection, the GalXC molecules enter the bloodstream and are exposed to the hepatocytes expressing the GalNAc receptor. After binding to the receptor, the GalXC molecules are internalized by the hepatocyte, ultimately enabling the GalXC molecules to access the RNAi machinery inside the hepatocyte. Our liver-targeted GalXC molecules routinely achieve high potencies, with EC50 values in the liver (i.e., the amount of material required to silence a target gene by 50 percent) typically in the 0.1 to 1.0 milligram per kilogram body weight (mg/kg) range in in vivo studies in mice. We have routinely generated GalXC molecules of this potency within 30 days of doing the initial algorithmic gene sequence analysis, which allows us to quickly explore a large number of potential target genes when selecting programs for ourselves and with our collaborators.
•    Our GalXC technologies are highly specific to the gene to which they are targeted. Due to the gene-sequence-based nature of how our GalXC molecules interact with their gene mRNA targets, facilitated by the RNAi pathway proteins inside the cell, we believe our GalXC molecules generally lack any direct effect on other gene targets. This specificity compares favorably to many small-molecule-based therapeutics, which may inhibit additional proteins beyond the intended protein target.
•Our GalXC molecules have a long duration of action. Our GalXC platform was designed to, and in the case of our liver-based GalXC technology, has demonstrated in clinical studies, a duration of action that supports infrequent dosing (e.g., dosing that is on a monthly, quarterly, or potentially an even less frequent basis).
•Our GalXC molecules have demonstrated a high therapeutic index. In both preclinical and clinical studies, our GalXC molecules have been shown to be generally well-tolerated, even at dose levels far exceeding the expected efficacious dose level. We believe this property may reduce the risk that our GalXC molecules have tolerability liabilities precluding further development. 
•Our GalXC molecules can be manufactured by existing, standard methods. Our GalXC molecules consist of RNA oligonucleotides, which can be manufactured with well-understood chemistries on existing readily available equipment. 
•Our GalXC RNAi therapies are fully reversible after cessation of treatment and can also be modulated by dose or intervals between administration, unlike gene therapy and gene editing.
GalXC RNAi Technology Targeted to the Liver
To target the liver, we conjugate the tetraloop region of our GalXC molecules to a simple sugar, GalNAc, that is specifically recognized by a receptor on the surface of liver hepatocytes. This leads to internalization, ultimately enabling the GalXC molecules to access the RNAi machinery inside the hepatocyte and deliver our targeted oligonucleotide to the RISC complex. Due to the efficiency of this process, a full human dose may be administered via a single subcutaneous injection.
GalXC-Plus RNAi Technology for Tissues Outside the Liver
For delivering to tissues outside the liver, we have continued to innovate our GalXC platform using modified structures, chemistries, and conjugated moieties. Referred to as GalXC-Plus, these proprietary technological advances extend our expertise in RNAi silencing to address new tissues and organs outside the liver, while retaining key pharmacological features from GalXC. In 2020, we presented preclinical data demonstrating the potential application of our GalXC-Plus technology to the CNS, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue.
Research
We continue to advance our GalXC RNAi platform as it is applied to therapeutic targets expressed in hepatocytes using GalNAc conjugates for both our collaborative research and development programs and our internal liver-targeted programs. All existing Dicerna collaborative programs include one or more liver-targeted applications of the GalXC RNAi platform.
In addition, we are exploring applications of our GalXC-Plus RNAi technology against therapeutic gene targets expressed in tissues other than the liver, including targets expressed in the CNS, muscle tissue, adipose tissue, tumor-associated immune cells, and other tissues. We have achieved significant gene target knockdown in multiple cell types and regions of the CNS and these other tissues, in both rodents and nonhuman primates. These extrahepatic applications are based on proprietary modifications to our well-characterized, clinical-stage GalXC platform that enable extrahepatic delivery and pharmacological activity.
On August 6, 2020, we presented for the first time preclinical data related to our GalXC-Plus RNAi technology in CNS, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues. Results from preclinical studies demonstrated consistent and durable CNS-wide target mRNA knockdown using novel constructs regardless of route of administration (intrathecal [IT] or intracisterna magna [ICM]), and reduction in target mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue using optimized chemistries, resulting in equivalent and potentially highly durable target knockdown regardless of dosing regimens.
Status of Dicerna Programs
Our four current core GalXC development programs are as follows:
Nedosiran for Primary Hyperoxaluria
Nedosiran is our lead investigational product candidate for the treatment of PH1, PH2, and PH3 and is derived from our GalXC platform technology. PH is a family of rare, life-threatening genetic liver disorders characterized by the overproduction of oxalate, a highly insoluble metabolic end-product that is eliminated from the body mainly by the kidneys. In patients with PH, the kidneys are unable to eliminate fully the large amount of oxalate that is produced. This accumulation of oxalate compromises the renal system, which may result in severe damage to the kidneys and other organs.
PH encompasses three genetically distinct, autosomal-recessive, inborn errors of glyoxylate metabolism characterized by the overproduction of oxalate. PH1, PH2, and PH3 are each characterized by a specific enzyme deficiency. PH1 is caused by a deficiency of glyoxylate-aminotransferase, PH2 is caused by a deficiency of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, and PH3 is caused by a deficiency of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase. The last step in the production of oxalate in the liver involves the enzyme product of the LDHA gene, making LDHA silencing what we believe is an ideal approach to blocking oxalate over-production in PH1, PH2, and PH3. Our nedosiran product candidate is designed to block production of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme by silencing the LDHA gene, which is the final common pathway of oxalate production in the liver. 
As PH is characterized by overproduction of oxalate in the liver, patients with PH are predisposed to the development of recurrent urinary tract (urolithiasis) and kidney (nephrolithiasis) stones, composed of calcium oxalate crystals formed from the excess oxalate. Stone formation is accompanied by diffuse deposits of calcium oxalate in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) of some patients with PH, which produces tubular toxicity, inflammation, and renal damage. This injury is compounded by the effects of renal calculi-related obstruction, frequent superimposed infections, and damage due to procedures needed to relieve stone-related obstruction. Compromised renal function can eventually result in the accumulation of oxalate in a wide range of organs, including the skin, bones, eyes, and heart. In the most severe cases, symptoms start in the first year of life. A combined liver-kidney transplant may be undertaken to resolve PH1 or PH2, but it is an invasive solution with limited availability and high morbidity that requires lifelong immune suppression to prevent organ rejection. Based on the evaluation of genome sequence databases, there may be as many as 16,000 people with PH in the U.S. and major European countries.
Most patients are diagnosed with PH in childhood or early adulthood. A number of supportive therapies are used in an attempt to mitigate some effects of the disease, including hyperhydration of at least three liters of fluid per day per square meter of body-surface area (5 L/day for a 70-kg adult). These regimens can be problematic in infants and toddlers, necessitating placement of a gastrostomy tube to ensure adequate nighttime fluid administration. Affected patients are at considerable risk of serious renal complications during periods of increased fluid loss (e.g., fever, diarrhea/vomiting, or urinary tract infections) or when oral hydration is compromised (e.g., following surgical procedures). Oral potassium citrate administration multiple times daily is used to potentially alleviate crystallization and alkalinize the urine. In PH1, between 10-30% of patients are partially responsive (i.e., greater than a 30% reduction of urinary oxalate (“Uox”) excretion) to high daily administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), but rarely do these patients reach normal or near-normal oxalate levels. A new therapy developed by a competing biopharmaceutical company for the treatment of PH1 was approved by select regulatory authorities in late 2020; however, at present, no therapies are approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of all three genetically known subtypes of PH. 
For PH1 and PH2 patients with more advanced disease, dialysis up to seven days per week may be used in an attempt to remove stored and ongoing overproduction of oxalate. Many healthcare providers now consider liver transplantation approaches earlier in the disease course to minimize the risk of irreversible tissue damage. We believe this level of unmet need provides a strong rationale for our initial focus on the treatment of PH.
Dicerna has developed nedosiran as a once-monthly fixed-dose injection for the treatment of PH. This once-monthly formulation of nedosiran is designed to avoid the sudden oxalate spikes that could occur with less frequent administration or missed dosages, which could result in the formation of kidney stones and renal failure. To maximize patient convenience, we are developing pre-filled syringes to enable self-administration by most PH patients without the need for involvement of a healthcare provider for dosing.
In 2018, nedosiran received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, and the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) designated nedosiran as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PH. In June 2020, the FDA granted rare pediatric disease designation for nedosiran. Under the FDA’s rare pediatric disease designation program, the FDA may grant a priority review voucher to a Sponsor who receives a product approval for a rare pediatric disease on or before September 30, 2026. Subject to FDA approval of nedosiran for the treatment of PH, we believe we would be eligible to receive a voucher that may be redeemed to receive priority review for a subsequent marketing application for a different product candidate or which could be sold or transferred. 
The broader PHYOX™ clinical trial program is designed to evaluate nedosiran in PH1, PH2, and PH3 patients of all ages and stages of renal health. Data from PHYOX™1, PHYOX2, PHYOX4 clinical trials, the ongoing PHYOX3 open-label extension study, and Dicerna’s PHYOX-OBX natural history study of PH3 participants are expected to support the initial nedosiran New Drug Application (“NDA”) submission.
PHYOX1 Single-Ascending-Dose Study
Data from the complete PHYOX1 trial, a Phase 1 single-ascending-dose study of nedosiran in healthy volunteers and study participants with PH1 and PH2, showed that nedosiran was generally well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and PH participants, and no serious safety concerns were identified in this study. In addition, nedosiran administration was associated with normalization or near-normalization of Uox levels in 14 of 18 participants with PH1 or PH2 following a single dose. We define normal and near-normal Uox as below 0.46 mmol/1.73m2 BSA/24 hr and from 0.46 to 0.6 mmol/1.73m2 BSA/24 hr, respectively. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single-ascending doses of nedosiran. Nedosiran was generally well-tolerated based on data from 18 participants (15 adults and three adolescents [participants 13-16 years old]) with PH1 (n=15) or PH2 (n=3) and 25 adult healthy volunteers. Four participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) that were determined by the investigator to be unrelated to nedosiran treatment. A total of seven participants dosed with nedosiran experienced mild or moderate injection-site reactions (defined as occurring four hours or more after injection), all of which resolved without intervention in a mean of 25 hours. No clinically meaningful safety signals were observed, including no clinically significant liver function test abnormalities.
Secondary endpoints included the change in 24-hour Uox excretion from baseline, defined as the mean of two 24-hour collections during screening. With respect to efficacy data in PHYOX1, nedosiran was associated with a mean maximal reduction of 24-hour Uox of 48.8% (1.5 mg/kg), 68.5% (3.0 mg/kg), and 78.0% (6.0 mg/kg) in adult patients with PH1 or PH2 following single-dose administration.
PHYOX2 Multidose, Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Pivotal Trial
PHYOX2 is a multidose, double-blind, 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled pivotal trial of nedosiran designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nedosiran delivered as a once-monthly subcutaneous injection in participants six years of age and older who have PH1 or PH2. This global trial includes countries across North America, Europe, and other regions, including Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The primary endpoint of the study is the percent change from baseline in area under the curve (“AUC”) of 24-hour Uox excretion between Days 90 and 180.
Full enrollment in the PHYOX2 trial was successfully completed in late 2020 and we anticipate the last patient to complete this study in the first half of 2021. We expect to report top-line results from the study in mid-2021.
PHYOX3 Long-Term, Multidose, Open-Label Extension Study
Following positive Phase 1 data from PHYOX1 in 2019, we received clearance to proceed with the pivotal trial (PHYOX2) and PHYOX3, a long-term, multidose, open-label, extension study of nedosiran in PH. Unlike the PHYOX2 trial, which requires screening and enrollment of new participants, patients are permitted to transition into the PHYOX3 trial from any previous nedosiran trial in which they have participated and completed. 
The primary endpoint of PHYOX3 is to evaluate the impact of monthly nedosiran administration on the annual rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (“eGFR”), a measure of kidney function. The PHYOX3 trial will also evaluate the long-term effect of nedosiran on Uox excretion, new stone formation, progression of nephrocalcinosis, and the potential to enable the gradual decrease or elimination of patients’ supportive hyperhydration therapies. 
In total, 16 participants from the completed PHYOX1 trial entered the PHYOX3 study. In October 2020, we presented an interim analysis of data on the 13 participants who had reached Day 180 and received six monthly doses. 
Three participants included in the safety analysis were not included in the efficacy analysis, as they had not yet reached Day 180 at the time of the analysis. All 13 participants (10 with PH1 and three with PH2) receiving nedosiran achieved normal (12 of 13) or near-normal (one of 13) Uox excretion levels at one or more timepoints. Of these, all 10 (100%) of the participants with PH1, and two of the three (67%) participants with PH2, achieved normal Uox excretion levels at one or more visits, and 62% of all participants achieved normal Uox excretions on at least three consecutive visits, meeting protocol-defined eligibility for gradual reduction in fluid intake requirements. In this study, we define normal and near-normal Uox as below 0.46 mmol/1.73m2 BSA/24 hr and from 0.46 to 0.6 mmol/1.73m2 BSA/24 hr, respectively.
Nedosiran was generally well-tolerated, and no serious safety concerns were identified in this study as of this interim analysis. There were no treatment discontinuations or study withdrawals during the observation period. Two participants had serious TEAEs (pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis) that were determined by the investigator to be unrelated to nedosiran treatment. The most common TEAEs were mild to moderate administration-site reactions. 
Additional PHYOX Trials: PHYOX4, PHYOX7, PHYOX8, and PHYOX-OBX
Given the fluid nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving and extraordinary actions undertaken by clinical trial sites globally, we continue to evaluate our clinical plans related to nedosiran. At this time, the status of additional PHYOX trials is as follows:
•PHYOX4: Enrollment in a study of patients with PH3 began in January 2021 and the first patient was dosed in February 2021. We anticipate top-line results from the study mid-year 2021. 
•PHYOX7: A study of PH1 and PH2 patients with severe renal impairment, including those in dialysis, is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021. 
•PHYOX8: An open-label study in PH1 and PH2 patients aged 0-5 years with relatively intact renal function is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2021. 
•PHYOX-OBX: We initiated an observational study in the third quarter of 2020 in participants with PH3 to evaluate the association between Uox excretion and the rate of kidney stone formation. Enrollment of participants in this study is expected in the first quarter of 2021.
 In discussions with the FDA, we received feedback indicating alignment on a path to the full approval of nedosiran for the treatment of PH1 and PH2 based on achievement of substantial reduction of Uox excretion in patients with PH1 and PH2 after nedosiran administration versus those administered placebo in the PHYOX2 pivotal trial. With this feedback, we believe we have a path to seek full approval for both PH1 and PH2 based on PHYOX2 results. We received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the development of nedosiran for the treatment of PH1 in July 2019. We plan to continue our dialogue with the FDA regarding endpoints for studies involving patients with PH3 as part of the PHYOX clinical development program for nedosiran. We anticipate submitting an NDA for nedosiran near the end of the third quarter of 2021.
RG6346 for Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection
Our GalXC product candidate for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, RG6346, is currently being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial. In order to be optimally positioned to develop and commercialize RG6346 in combination with other novel drugs, we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement with Roche in October 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, we are leading the development of RG6346 through the current Phase 1 trial, and pending favorable results, Roche intends to further develop RG6346 with the overall goal of developing a combination regimen to achieve a functional cure of chronic HBV in combination with additional Roche product candidates. Roche will be responsible for initiating RG6346 in a Phase 2 combination trial, which is anticipated in the first quarter of 2021. The agreement also provides an option for the companies to collaborate in the discovery, development, and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics intended for the treatment of chronic HBV.
HBV is the world’s most common serious liver infection and affects an estimated 292 million people worldwide. Chronic HBV is characterized by the presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen (“HBsAg”) for six months or more. Current therapies for HBV include nucleoside analogs (“NUCs”) and pegylated interferon regimens. Interferons are less effective at suppressing viral replication and are associated with several side effects. NUCs are relatively safe to use but usually require indefinite therapy that increases the risk of non-adherence. Furthermore, the vast majority of patients treated with these agents do not achieve an immunological cure of chronic HBV infection as defined by the sustained clearance of HBsAg and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) suppression in patient blood or serum. The chance of achieving a long-term immunological cure may be significantly enhanced with the introduction of novel drugs, such as RG6346, designed to reduce intrahepatic and serum HBsAg, as well as HBV DNA. These novel drugs may potentially be used in combination with each other and existing therapies, such as NUCs.
The Phase 1 trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RG6346 in healthy volunteers and in patients with non-cirrhotic chronic HBV. Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of RG6346 and to evaluate preliminary pharmacodynamic effects on markers of HBV antiviral efficacy, including reductions of HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in blood. The Phase 1 clinical trial is divided into three groups:
•Group A is a single-ascending-dose arm in which 30 healthy volunteers received a dose of RG6346. 
•Group B is a single-dose arm in which eight participants with chronic HBV who are naïve to NUC therapy received a 3.0 mg/kg dose of RG6346 or placebo.
•Group C is a multiple-ascending-dose arm in which RG6346 (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg) or placebo was administered to 18 participants with chronic HBV who are already being treated with NUCs.
Participants in Groups B and C were eligible to enter an extended follow-up observation period if they achieved an HBsAg reduction from baseline of ≥1.0 log10 IU/mL at the end of the treatment period (12 weeks/85 days for Group B; 16 weeks/112 days for Group C). Enrollment for the originally planned cohorts was completed in June 2020. Dosing in the 6.0 mg/kg dose group was completed; however, extended follow-up observation remains ongoing for a number of Group C participants. 
In agreement with Roche, we are enrolling two additional, optional, open-label Group C cohorts, Cohort 4C and Cohort 5C, for which Roche will reimburse us. Cohorts 4C and 5C will evaluate fixed dosing regimens and an extended conditional follow-up period. Cohort 4C is a single-dose cohort with a follow-up duration of up to 48 weeks. Cohort 5C is a multiple-dose cohort with a follow-up duration of up to 72 weeks.
In November 2020, we expanded upon the interim results from both Group B and Group C presented in August 2020. In particular, top-line data from the Group C cohort demonstrated that four monthly doses of RG6346 treatment resulted in substantial and durable reductions in biomarkers of HBV disease activity as measured by reductions in HBsAg levels lasting up to one year following the last dose. RG6346 was also shown to have a favorable tolerability profile in the trial. 
No significant adverse events (“SAEs”) were reported for participants treated with RG6346, and there were no dose-limiting toxicities or safety-related discontinuations. The most commonly reported adverse events were mild or moderate injection-site events. There were no dose-exposure or regimen-dependent increases in frequency or severity of adverse events, safety lab values, electrocardiogram readings, or vital signs.
In April 2020, Roche nominated the first of up to five targets under the research and development portion of our collaboration agreement.
Belcesiran (DCR-A1AT) for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease 
Our GalXC product candidate for the treatment of AATLD, belcesiran, is currently being tested in a Phase 1 clinical study. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (“AATD”) is a rare, genetic, inherited condition that can lead to AATLD in children and adults and lung disease in adults. The condition is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene. In people with AATLD, the liver produces an abnormal version of the AAT protein, which is prone to aggregation in the liver. This accumulation of mutated AAT in the liver can lead to liver disease. Individuals with AATLD also have an increased risk of having lung disease.
Research suggests that people who have the pair of gene variants called “ZZ” are most commonly identified as having AATLD. Recent epidemiology research indicates that approximately 120,000 individuals in Europe and 63,000 individuals in the U.S. carry this ZZ genotype; the genotype occurs more/most frequently in individuals of Northern European descent. Although most individuals with this pair will not develop liver disease, some will. Recent research indicates that the current diagnosis rate for AATLD in individuals with the ZZ genotype is approximately 10%, but that liver disease may remain under-diagnosed. AATLD can affect infants, children, and adults. Liver transplantation is currently the only effective treatment for AATLD.
In March 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to belcesiran for the treatment of AATD. In December 2019, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to belcesiran for the treatment of congenital AATD based on a positive opinion from the COMP of the EMA.
Our Phase 1 trial of belcesiran is an ongoing placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses of belcesiran when administered to healthy adult participants. Secondary objectives of the trial are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of belcesiran and to evaluate the preliminary pharmacodynamic effects on serum AAT protein concentrations. 
Following our business update in March 2020, further enrollment of healthy volunteers in the ongoing trial of belcesiran in healthy volunteers was temporarily paused due to site restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional safety precautions were implemented, including testing of any participants presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and enrollment resumed in May 2020 after the Scientific Review Committee for the trial confirmed that the study could continue. We expect to advance belcesiran into Phase 2 development in the first half of 2021 and we expect to present data from the Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers in 2021.
In April 2020, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Alnylam. Under the collaboration agreement, Alnylam’s ALN-AAT02 and Dicerna’s belcesiran would be explored for the treatment of AATLD at our cost, and we had the option to progress one or both of these investigational medicines through clinical development. We selected belcesiran to advance in development for the treatment of patients with AATLD. 
At the completion of Phase 3, Alnylam has the no-cost opportunity to opt in to commercialize belcesiran in countries outside the U.S. where it already has a commercialization infrastructure in place (the “Commercialization Option”). If Alnylam exercises its Commercialization Option, the parties will share future development costs. Further, each party will pay tiered royalties to the other party based on a percentage of net product sales generated in its territory ranging from low single-digits to high teens. In the event Alnylam waives its Commercialization Option, we will retain worldwide rights to commercialize belcesiran in exchange for payments upon the satisfaction of certain milestones, up to an aggregate of $45.0 million, and royalties will be payable to Alnylam based on net product sales in the low to mid-single-digits. The A1AT Agreement is subject to customary termination provisions, and we may terminate the A1AT Agreement at any time without cause following the notice period described in the A1AT Agreement.
DCR-AUD for Alcohol Use Disorder
We are currently pursuing development of DCR-AUD for the treatment of AUD. DCR-AUD is an investigational therapy based on Dicerna’s GalXC technology for the treatment of AUD. DCR-AUD specifically knocks down ALDH2 gene expression in the liver, which plays a key role in alcohol metabolism. Inhibition of ALDH2 may help individuals with AUD avoid harmful levels of alcohol use.
AUD is a chronic condition characterized by compulsive alcohol use, loss of control over alcohol use, and a negative emotional state when not using alcohol. A range of medical, psychological, social, economic, and personal problems are associated with AUD. It is estimated that 14 million adults in the U.S. are living with AUD. With nearly 100,000 deaths annually, it is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the U.S.
Our goal is to submit an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) or Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) filing in mid-2021 and initiate a subsequent Phase 1 single-ascending-dose trial in healthy volunteers in the third quarter of 2021. 
Non-core Partner Development Programs
Novo Collaboration
On November 15, 2019, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novo (the “Novo Collaboration Agreement”). Under the terms of the Novo Collaboration Agreement, we and Novo will seek to use GalXC to explore more than 30 gene targets associated with liver disease with the goal of delivering multiple clinical candidates for disorders including chronic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), type 2 diabetes, obesity, and rare diseases. We will conduct and fund discovery and preclinical development to clinical candidate selection for each liver cell target. Novo will be responsible for all further development and commercialization of each candidate selected for development, with Dicerna manufacturing clinical candidates selected for Phase 1-related clinical development, subject to reimbursement for its manufacturing costs. In addition, we will assist Novo with the IND filing for the first development candidate. We also retain the ability to opt in to co-development of a total of two programs during clinical development in Phases 1-3, subject to limitations in the event of a change in control. If we exercise a co-development option, we also have an option to co-promote the product in the United States, subject to limitations in the event of a change in control of the Company. Additionally, we may lead the development and commercialization of two programs targeting orphan liver diseases, with Novo retaining the ability to opt in to both programs in Phases 1-3. We and Novo will share in profits and losses for the Company’s orphan liver and Novo products should both parties elect to co-develop.
We are working exclusively with Novo during the research collaboration period on the discovery, research, development, and commercialization of hepatocyte targets subject to certain exclusions including those targets subject to our existing partnerships and Novo is, during a specified discovery period, working exclusively with us in any new research and development of compounds and products directed to collaboration targets using small interfering RNA (“siRNA”) conjugated to the sugar GalNAc to reduce the expression of specific target genes in the liver. Under the Novo Collaboration Agreement, we are providing Novo with exclusive and non-exclusive licenses and manufacturing support to enable Novo to commercialize products derived from or containing compounds developed pursuant to such agreement.
Under the terms of the Novo Collaboration Agreement, Novo paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $175.0 million, subject to delivery of target information, in January 2020. We are also eligible to receive an additional $75.0 million ($25.0 million at the end of each of the first three years of the Novo Collaboration Agreement), contingent upon us delivering GalXC molecules for a defined number of targets, and additional payments totaling up to approximately $357.5 million per target upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. In addition, Novo will pay us mid-single-digits to mid-teens royalties on product sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of each product in such country, expiration of specified patent rights in such country, or the expiration of specified regulatory exclusivity in such country for GalXC products, subject to royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. 
In connection with the Novo Collaboration Agreement, we and Novo entered into a share purchase agreement on November 15, 2019, pursuant to which we agreed to issue to Novo 2,279,982 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50.0 million. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, Novo nominated its first candidate under the Novo Collaboration Agreement. In conjunction with the nomination of the first development candidate, Dicerna earned a $2.5 million milestone, which was received in February 2021. Also during the fourth quarter of 2020, Novo confirmed that Dicerna met its obligation to deliver GalXC molecules for a defined number of targets for the first year of the Novo Collaboration Agreement, entitling us to a $25.0 million payment. This payment was received in February 2021.
Roche Collaboration
As part of the terms of our collaboration agreement with Roche mentioned above, Roche had until receipt of interim Phase 1 data from the RG6346 Phase 1 study (but no later than December 31, 2020) to initiate a research and development collaboration with us to pursue up to five targets selected by Roche, which are intended primarily to treat HBV. Under an amendment to the collaboration agreement with Roche, in June 2020, we and Roche agreed to extend the date for nomination of targets from December 31, 2020 to January 15, 2021, subject to further potential extension by the parties due to the COVID-19 global pandemic shutdowns. Under the terms of the Roche Collaboration Agreement, the goal of such research and development collaboration will be to select compounds developed by us or Roche for Roche’s continued development and commercialization. Ours and Roche’s research and early development organizations will work exclusively with each other during the research and development collaboration period on the discovery, research, and development of such targets selected by Roche, which includes our performance of certain services. In April 2020, Roche nominated the first of up to five targets under the research and development portion of the Roche Collaboration Agreement.
Under the terms of the collaboration agreement with Roche, Roche paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $200.0 million in January 2020. We are also eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to approximately $1.5 billion, which includes payments upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. In addition, Roche will pay us up to mid-teens percent royalties on worldwide product sales. Royalties are payable until the later of 10 years after first commercial sale of each product in a country, expiration of patent rights in a country, or for products containing RG6346 in a given country, the expiration of data or regulatory exclusivity, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. In addition, we have an option to co-fund the development of products including RG6346 under the agreement and, if exercised, receive high-twenties to mid-thirties royalty rates on net sales of products in the U.S. If we exercise the co-funding option, we also have an option to co-promote products containing RG6346 in the U.S. 
Lilly Collaboration
On October 25, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Lilly (the “Lilly Collaboration Agreement”) for the discovery, development, and commercialization of potential new medicines in the areas of cardiometabolic disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and pain. Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we and Lilly will use our proprietary GalXC RNAi technology to progress new drug targets toward clinical development and commercialization. In addition, we will collaborate with Lilly on non-liver (i.e., extrahepatic) tissues, including neural tissues.
We will work exclusively with Lilly in the neurodegenerative disease and pain fields with the exception of mutually agreed upon orphan indications. Additionally, we will work exclusively with Lilly on select targets in the cardiometabolic field. Under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we will provide Lilly with exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to support the companies’ activities and to enable Lilly to commercialize products derived from or containing compounds developed pursuant to such agreement. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement provides for three initially named hepatocyte targets, and we and Lilly developed research programs with the goal of researching and developing multiple lead candidates directed to each of these initial targets. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement contemplates in excess of ten targets.
Lilly paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $100.0 million. We are also eligible to receive up to $350.0 million per target in development and commercialization milestones, in addition to a $5.0 million payment, which will become due for each of the extrahepatic targets when a product candidate achieves proof of principle in an animal model. In addition, we are eligible to earn mid-single- to low-double-digit royalties on product sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of data or regulatory exclusivity in such country, or 10 years after the first product sale in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. 
Simultaneously with the entry into the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we and Lilly entered into a share purchase agreement, pursuant to which Lilly purchased 5,414,185 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100.0 million.
During the first quarter of 2020, Lilly selected LY3819469, a GalXC molecule for the second collaboration target in cardiometabolic disease that targets the LPA gene, for advancement into preclinical development. We expect Lilly to file an IND for LY3819469 in the second quarter of 2021. Another GalXC molecule, LY3849889, is currently in preclinical development, and we expect Lilly to file an IND for LY3849889 in the first quarter of 2022.
Lilly filed an IND and initiated a Phase 1 study of LY3561774, a GalXC molecule for the first collaboration target in cardiometabolic disease that targets the ANGPTL3 gene for the treatment of dyslipidemia, in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result of this filing, we achieved a milestone associated with the first filing of an IND with the FDA, entitling us to a $10.0 million payment. 
In February 2021, Lilly notified us of their decision to extend for an additional year the initial research collaboration term for the extrahepatic targets subject to the Lilly Collaboration Agreement. Under the agreement between the companies, Lilly has the option to extend the three-year initial research collaboration term for these extrahepatic targets for up to three consecutive one-year periods. This first extension allows the research program for these extrahepatic targets under the collaboration between the two companies to continue through October 2022.
Alexion Collaboration
On October 22, 2018, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement (the “Alexion Collaboration Agreement”) with Alexion for the joint discovery and development of RNAi therapies for complement-mediated diseases. We will collaborate with Alexion on the discovery and development of two subcutaneously delivered GalXC candidates, currently in preclinical development, for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases with potential global commercialization by Alexion. We will lead the joint discovery and research efforts through the preclinical stage, and Alexion will lead development efforts beginning with Phase 1 studies. We will be responsible for manufacturing of the GalXC candidates for use through the completion of Phase 1, and certain related costs will be paid by Alexion. Alexion will be solely responsible for the manufacturing of any product candidate subsequent to the completion of Phase 1. The Alexion Collaboration Agreement provides Alexion with exclusive worldwide licenses as well as development and commercial rights to the GalXC RNAi molecules developed in the collaboration in exchange for development and approval-related milestones, sales milestones, and royalties on future product sales.
Alexion paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $22.0 million. The Alexion Collaboration Agreement also provides for potential additional payments to us of up to $600.0 million from proceeds from target option exercises and development and sales milestones, as defined in the agreement, which includes (i) option exercise fees of up to $20.0 million, representing $10.0 million for each of the targets selected; (ii) development milestones of up to $105.0 million for each product; and (iii) aggregate sales milestones of up to $160.0 million. Alexion also agreed to pay us mid-single- to low-double-digit royalties on potential product sales on a country-by-country, product-by-product basis until the later of the expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of market or regulatory exclusivity in such country, or 10 years after the first product sale in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. 
Simultaneously with the entry into the Alexion Collaboration Agreement, we and Alexion entered into a share purchase agreement, pursuant to which Alexion purchased 835,834 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $15.0 million.
In November 2019, the Company and Alexion amended the Alexion Collaboration Agreement to clarify funding of certain manufacturing costs for each of the two initial targets and increased milestone payments for the additional targets if Alexion exercised its options for the two additional targets.
In December 2019, Alexion exercised its options for the exclusive rights to two additional targets within the complement pathway for the discovery and development of GalXC molecules. These exercises expanded the companies’ existing research collaboration and license agreement to encompass four targets within the complement pathway. In connection with the option exercises, Alexion paid Dicerna a total of $20.0 million, or $10.0 million in option exercise fees per additional new target that will be recognized into revenue as the related services are performed. 
Two GalXC molecules targeted for complement-mediated indications are currently in preclinical development under the Alexion Collaboration Agreement. We expect to supply an IND-supporting package for DCR-COMP1, which targets the C3 gene, in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to supply an IND-supporting package related to DCR-COMP2, which targets the CFB gene, in the first quarter of 2022. While we anticipate delivery of the packages subject to our contractual obligations regarding these two candidates by the given dates, the decision of if and when to make IND/CTA filings is completely within Alexion’s discretion.
BI Collaboration
On October 27, 2017, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with BI (the “BI Agreement”), pursuant to which we and BI jointly research and develop product candidates for the treatment of chronic liver disease using GalXC. The BI Agreement is for the development of product candidates against one target gene with an option for BI to add the development of product candidates that target a second gene (the “Second Target”). Pursuant to the BI Agreement, we granted BI a worldwide license in connection with the research and development of such candidates and transferred certain intellectual property rights of the selected product candidates to BI for clinical development and commercialization. We also may provide assistance to BI in order to help BI further develop selected product candidates.
BI paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million for the first target. BI also agreed to reimburse Dicerna certain third-party expenses of $0.3 million. We are eligible to receive up to $191.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the initial target. We are also eligible to receive royalty payments on potential global net sales, subject to certain adjustments, tiered from high single-digits up to low double-digits. Milestone payments that are contingent upon our performance under the BI Agreement include potential developmental milestones totaling $99.0 million. Potential net sales milestones total $95.0 million. BI’s Second Target option provided for an option fee payment of $5.0 million and success-based development and commercialization milestones and royalty payments to Dicerna.
In October 2018, BI exercised its Second Target option, which entitled the Company to a non-refundable payment of $5.0 million and reimbursement of $0.7 million for certain third-party expenses. The terms of the Second Target option exercise and related rights and obligations associated with the Second Target were agreed to in an Additional Target Agreement (the “ATA”), which was entered into on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the ATA, BI is responsible for future clinical development and commercialization of candidate products for the Second Target. We are eligible to receive up to $170.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the Second Target. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on potential global net sales, subject to certain adjustments, in the mid-single digits. Except as otherwise set forth in the ATA, development of the Second Target is subject to the terms of the original BI Agreement.
In addition to establishing the terms of the Second Target option exercise, the ATA also amends the BI Agreement to provide the parties with the opportunity to consider the development of product candidates targeting a further additional target gene (the “Third Target” option). 
Cross-License Program
Alnylam 
In addition to the collaboration agreement noted above, in April 2020, we and Alnylam (collectively, the “parties”) entered into a Patent Cross License Agreement (the “PH Agreement”). Pursuant to the PH Agreement, the parties completed a cross-license of their respective intellectual property for Alnylam’s lumasiran and Dicerna’s nedosiran investigational programs for the treatment of PH. No upfront cash consideration was exchanged in either the PH Agreement or the collaboration agreement.
Pursuant to the PH Agreement, the parties granted to each other a perpetual non-exclusive cross-license to their respective intellectual property related to their respective PH treatment investigational programs to ensure that each party has the freedom to develop and commercialize its respective product with Alnylam’s lumasiran targeting glycolate oxidase (“GO”) for the treatment of PH1 and our nedosiran targeting lactate dehydrogenase A (“LDHA”) for the treatment of PH1, PH2, and PH3. Each party will have sole discretion concerning the research and development of its products in the field. In exchange for the license, Alnylam is required to pay mid- to high-single-digit royalties to us based on global net sales of lumasiran and we are required to pay low-single-digit royalties to Alnylam on global net sales of nedosiran.
Intellectual Property
We are seeking multifaceted and multi-layered protection for our intellectual property on a global level that includes licenses, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, subcontractors, and other third parties and generally seek to control access to our documentation and proprietary information as well as ownership to nascent intellectual property.
Patents and proprietary rights
We own U.S. patents and pending patent applications with claims to methods and compositions of matter that cover various aspects of our RNAi technology and our discovery technologies, including our proprietary GalXC technology and the newly developed GalXC-Plus technology. These U.S. patents include the following platform patents that protect our ability to make our structures: U.S. 8,349,809 (issued in January 2013, with a projected expiration date of January 2030); U.S. 10,131,912 (issued in November 2018, with a projected expiration date of January 2030); U.S. 8,513,207 (issued in August 2013, with a projected expiration date of May 2030); and U.S. 8,927,705 (issued in January 2015, with a projected expiration date of July 2030). These patents are from the same family of patents and constitute the core patents for our GalXC technology. We also own numerous patents and patent applications covering other elements of our platform technology, as well as patents to specific RNAi sequences that drive activity against a substantial number of high-value disease targets, including targets for our disclosed core and non-core programs. We have issued or pending claims to RNAi molecules, pharmaceutical compositions/formulations, methods of use, including in vitro and in vivo methods of reducing target gene expression, methods of treatment, methods of inhibiting cell growth, and methods of synthesis.
Our strategy around protection of our proprietary technology, including any innovations and improvements, is to obtain patent coverage in various jurisdictions around the world with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global pharmaceutical markets. Generally, patents have a term of 20 years from the earliest non-provisional priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed, and the patent in question has not been invalidated by a court with proper jurisdiction. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or shortened. We are obtaining worldwide patent protection for novel molecules, composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, including treatment of disease, methods of manufacture, and other novel uses for the inventive molecules originating from our research and development efforts, and other things. We continuously assess whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain confidentiality for the “know-how” regarding a novel invention or the trade secrets that may be inherent in a given process or method rather than pursue patent protection. For each patent application that is filed, we strategically tailor our claims in accordance with the existing patent landscape around a particular patentable matter.
We cannot predict with any certainty if any third-party U.S. or foreign patent rights, or other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our collaborators against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our collaborators may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.
It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors who receive confidential information from us, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property, except that employees are permitted to invent in unrelated fields during non-work hours, and such inventions would not be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
See Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property” for a more detailed discussion of the risks to our intellectual property.
Competition
To our knowledge, there are no companies other than ourselves and our collaborators developing GalXC or GalXC-Plus molecules for therapeutic use. We believe that our scientific knowledge and expertise in RNAi-based therapies provide us with competitive advantages over the various companies and other entities that are attempting to develop similar treatments. However, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Our competition can be grouped into three broad categories:
•Commercialized products and product candidates, as well as development programs that treat the same diseases for which we are also developing treatments. These companies include Oxthera AB, Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus Biopharma, Vir Biotechnology, Inc., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.;
•Other companies working to develop RNAi therapeutic products. These companies include Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Silence Therapeutics plc, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Avidity Biosciences, Inc.; and
•Companies developing technology known as antisense, which, similar to the RNAi therapy we use, attempts to silence specific genes. These companies include Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dyne Therapeutics, Inc., and Wave Life Sciences Ltd.
Our success will be based, in part, upon our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of drugs that offer competitive advantages such as improved safety, more convenient dosing, and greater efficacy than competing products for the treatment of our targeted patients. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are superior to the products we may develop. 
Summarized below is information on perceived competition for our most advanced product candidates:
Primary Hyperoxaluria
We believe that the following product and product candidates in clinical development, if approved, could compete with nedosiran:

Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Oxlumo (lumasiran) | RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase specifically for the treatment of PH1 | Approved/On the market
Oxthera AB | Oxabact | Bacteria intended to interact with the intestinal epithelial cells and promote secretion of oxalate from the body | Phase 3 
Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Reloxaliase(formerly ALLN-177) | RNAi enzyme to reduce oxalate levels | Phase 2 
Biocodex, S.A. | Stiripentol | GABA reuptake inhibitor | Phase 2 

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of PH.
Hepatitis B Virus
Many companies across the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are seeking improved treatments for chronic HBV infection. It is generally accepted that improved treatments will consist of combinations of therapeutic agents, acting via different mechanisms of action. We consider our competitors to be those developing potential treatments for chronic HBV that act via a similar mechanism of action as our RG6346 product candidate; specifically, potential treatments that block or lead to the destruction of the mRNA and pgRNA of HBV. It may be possible for others to develop an improved treatment for chronic HBV that does not include this mechanism of action.
We believe that the following product candidates in clinical development, if approved, could compete with RG6346:    

Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Collaborative Partner: Vir Biotechnology | ALN-HBV02VIR-2218 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 2 
Arbutus Biopharma | AB-729 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 1a/1b
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Collaborative Partner: Janssen | JNJ-3989 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 2 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Collaborative Partner: GlaxoSmithKline | IONIS-HBVRX | RNA-targeted antisense oligonucleotide | Phase 2 

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of HBV.
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease
Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat AATLD. We believe that the following product candidates in clinical development, if approved, could compete with belcesiran:

Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | ARO-AAT | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 2/3
Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | VX-864 | Oral small-molecule corrector of misfolded AAT protein | Phase 2 

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of AATLD.
If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we undertake clinical trials, they may compete with therapies that are either in development or currently marketed by our competitors. However, notwithstanding the availability of existing drugs or drug candidates, we believe sufficient unmet medical need exists to warrant the continuing advancement of our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
Alcohol Use Disorder
Currently, the only approved drugs to treat AUD are acamprosate calcium, disulfiram, oral naltrexone, and extended-release injectable naltrexone. Other companies across the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are seeking improved treatments for AUD. We consider our competitors to be those developing RNAi-based treatments for AUD that target liver expression of the ALDH2 gene, and we are not aware of any active development programs of this nature. It may be possible for other companies to develop an improved treatment for AUD that does not include this mechanism of action.
We believe that the following product candidates in clinical development, if approved, could compete with DCR-AUD:

Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | AD04 | Ultra-low dose formulation of ondansetron; selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist | Phase 3
Amygdala Neurosciences, Inc. | ANS-6637 | Selective and reversible ALDH2 inhibitor | Phase 2

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of AUD.
Sales and Marketing
Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and, where appropriate, the approval and marketing authorization of our product candidates. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through strategic alliances and/or distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of funds, our ability to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products, compliance with laws governing our sales and marketing activities, and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties.
Commercial readiness activities continue across the organization to ensure the timing of appropriate infrastructure, processes, and capabilities to support Dicerna’s evolution to a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. The primary focus is on U.S. commercialization infrastructure for nedosiran and the Medical Affairs and Commercial teams that have been established. Additional infrastructure and commercialization activities are paced to the PHYOX programs and NDA preparations. Outside the U.S., active discussions for regional and/or multinational commercial collaboration partners are underway.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical, or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. For each product candidate, we currently contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers for certain drug materials, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our product candidates. 
In November 2019, we entered into an initial five-year agreement with a supplier for the development, manufacture, and supply of clinical and commercial product. In January 2020, we executed an amendment to this agreement which allows for advance preferential scheduling to the manufacturing line. 
We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis. We have not entered into long-term purchase commitments; however, from time to time, we make binding demand-based forecasts nine to 18 months ahead of planned supply requirements.
The current supply of our investigational medicines continues to be sufficient to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. Based on current evaluations, our supply chain continues to appear intact at this time and able to meet at least the next 12 months of clinical, nonclinical, and CMC supply demands across all programs. We have undertaken efforts to mitigate potential future impacts to the supply chain by increasing our stock of critical starting materials required to meet our needs and our collaborative partners’ needs through 2021 and by identifying and engaging alternative suppliers. We continue to be alert to the potential for disruptions that could arise from COVID-19 and remain in close contact with suppliers.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control, and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, record-keeping, advertising, distribution, sampling, pricing, sales and marketing, safety, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and the extensive laws and regulations that apply to drug products and product candidates in the U.S. are subject to change.
U.S. government regulation
NDA approval processes
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may result in a delay of approval or subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
•    refusal to approve pending applications;
•    withdrawal of an approval;
•    imposition of a clinical hold;
•    issuance of warning or untitled letters;
•    product recalls;
•    product seizures;
•    refusals of government contracts;
•    total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
•    injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally includes the following:
•    completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable laws and regulations;
•    submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•    approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•    performance and inspection of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials and clinical data according to FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
•    submission of an NDA to the FDA and the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA for filing;
•    satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
•    satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the major investigational sites to ensure data integrity and assess compliance with GCP requirements; and
•    FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or non-clinical testing stage. Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the non-clinical studies, manufacturing, and quality information, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with FDA regulations and GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. All research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and the informed consent form before a clinical trial commences at that institution, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to be publicly posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
•    Phase 1 – The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and elimination. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•    Phase 2 – Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•    Phase 3 – Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA, the sponsor, or a data safety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of an NDA. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. In the case of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, communication with the FDA may occur more frequently than as outlined above.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, identity, strength, purity, and quality of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations and GCP.
The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA typically requires that an NDA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in certain circumstances. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may condition approval on the completion of post approval studies. Such studies may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. If the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug, the FDA may also condition approval on the implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”). The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
Expedited review and approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, breakthrough, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. A sponsor can request application of these programs either alone or in combination with each other, depending on the circumstances. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. None of the expedited approval programs change the NDA approval standard applied to a product.
New drugs are eligible for Fast Track status if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track status entitles such a drug to expedited review and frequent contact with the FDA review division. Unlike other expedited review programs, Fast Track designation allows the FDA to accept for review individual sections of the NDA on a rolling basis. The FDA may also grant a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months from filing of an NDA, rather than the standard review of ten months from filing under current Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA typically requires that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval conduct post-approval clinical trials. As an additional condition of approval, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of all promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The FDA may expedite the approval of a designated breakthrough therapy, which is a drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA must take the appropriate steps to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), was signed into law. The Cures Act included numerous provisions that may be relevant to our product candidates, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative and breakthrough therapies. The Cures Act amends the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH and to authorize the FDA to increase spending on innovation projects. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. The Cures Act also includes a provision that requires certain manufacturers or distributors of an investigational drug to make their policies on the availability of certain expanded access programs publicly available. Because the Cures Act was enacted relatively recently and the FDA may take several years to develop these policies, it is difficult to know the full extent of how the Cures Act will affect our business.
Patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product candidate’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (i.e., an NDA that contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant) submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to product candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications including a full NDA to market the same product candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product candidate as defined by the FDA prior to us.
On August 8, 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) was enacted. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA’s pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act, including the FDARA amendment, its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.
Pediatric exclusivity, pediatric use and rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain product candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a “Written Request”) relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
FDARA amended the FDCA to provide that a drug, for which an application has been submitted or approved pursuant to section 505(b)(2) or 505(j) of the FDCA, will not be considered ineligible for approval or misbranded because the labeling of such drug omits a pediatric indication or other pediatric labeling information when the omitted pediatric information is protected by patent or marketing exclusivity. FDARA further permits FDA to require specific labeling for such products related to the omitted pediatric indication and information to, among other things, make clear that the omission of the information is related to the exclusivity. We do not know if or how such changes to the pediatric exclusivity provisions might affect our business.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most product candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
Section 529 of the FDCA is intended to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Although there are existing incentive programs to encourage the development and study of drugs for rare diseases, pediatric populations, and unmet medical needs, section 529 provides an additional incentive for rare pediatric diseases, which may be used alone or in combination with other incentive programs. “Rare pediatric disease” is defined as a disease that:
•    is “a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents”; and
•    is “a rare disease or condition” as defined in the FDCA, which includes diseases and conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. and diseases and conditions that affect a larger number of persons and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. can be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.
Under section 529, the sponsor of a human drug application for a rare pediatric disease drug product may be eligible for a voucher that can be used (or sold) to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product. The rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers program was most recently re-authorized by Congress in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, extending the rare pediatric disease program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for priority review vouchers to be granted through September 30, 2026.
Post-approval requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 trials (post-approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and efficacy may be imposed as a condition of approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in REMS or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling changes, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
•    record-keeping requirements;
•    reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate;
•    submission of periodic reports;
•    providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
•    drug sampling, stability and distribution requirements;
•    notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and
•    complying with statutory and regulatory requirements for promotion and advertising.
Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved product candidates are required to register their establishments and provide product listing information to the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
Regulation outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other jurisdictions governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries, and approval of the regulators of such countries or supranational areas, such as the European Union (“EU”), before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
European Union clinical trials regulation
In the EU, a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s National Competent Authority (“NCA”) and at least one independent Ethics Committee (“EC”) much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. Under the current regime (the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and corresponding national laws) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new Regulation, which will be directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. It is expected that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will come into effect following confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System, the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the new Clinical Trials Regulation, through an independent audit, which is currently expected to occur in December 2021.
Drug review and approval
To obtain a marketing authorization in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (comprising the EU Member States, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein), a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EEA Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). The centralized procedure, compulsory for certain medicines, including those produced by biotechnology, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products, and those with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which contain a new active substance, or which are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EEA Member States. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
Through the decentralized procedure, a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in the EEA can be simultaneously authorized in several EEA Member States. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the other EEA Member States. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment reports, each Member State involved must decide whether to recognize the approval. If a Member State does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EEA before the application for marketing authorization is made. The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (1) is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; and (2) either the prevalence of such condition must not be more than five in 10,000 persons in the EEA when the application is made, or without the benefits derived from orphan status, it must be unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EEA to justify the investment needed for its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EEA, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Sponsors of orphan drugs in the EU can enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including a reduction of fees or fee waivers and up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. During such period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization applications for “similar medicinal products” will not be accepted, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product, the marketing authorization holder consents to the second orphan medicinal product application, or where the marketing authorization holder cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. In the EAA, a “similar medicinal product” is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify the maintenance of market exclusivity.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK. This transition period ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now that the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely only on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered and paid for by third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchases, private health plans, or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, products may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective, and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and 
•neither experimental nor investigational. 
Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, the current U.S. administration has indicated support for possible new measures to regulate drug pricing. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could significantly limit our net revenue and financial results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, then-President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration's proposals. In response, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027. On December 28, 2020, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting CMS from implementing the MFN rule.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
Healthcare Reform
In recent years, U.S. and foreign governmental authorities and other payors have attempted to control healthcare costs by limiting coverage and reimbursement for certain medical products. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry by, for example, expanding coverage for the uninsured and seeking to contain overall healthcare costs. Regarding pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA contains provisions of importance to our potential product candidates, including among other things, provisions that:
•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
•expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
•addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
•expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
•created new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act; 
•created a new requirement to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that manufacturers and authorized distributors of record provide to physicians; and
•created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court; the Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA in early 2021. The implementation of the ACA is ongoing, the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. 
Both new legislative reforms, as well as actions taken by the Biden administration, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, then-President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic. In addition, on February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act that made several healthcare reforms. For example, the law changes the discounts manufacturers are required to apply to their drugs under the Coverage Gap Discount Program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price starting in 2019. In addition, the law increases civil and criminal penalties for fraud and abuse laws, including, for example, increases in both criminal fines for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute and corresponding prison sentences.
 Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs and biologics under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135.0 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) implemented several of these provisions to date. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule that would allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. Additionally, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Although a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke, or otherwise modify these recent executive and administrative actions.
Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls and/or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have price structures that are significantly lower.
Other Healthcare Fraud and Laws
In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of the HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) and the Health Resources and Service Administration (“HRSA”)), the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) (discussed below).
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product candidates may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not preempted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, more general personal privacy laws have also been enacted by various States and by other countries where we do business, such as member countries of the European Union, that require adoption of policies and procedures to protect, properly store, and to obtain permission to use in our business and clinical research. 
Certain states have passed privacy laws that may complicate our privacy compliance efforts. For example, in California, the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, established a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. The CCPA has been in effect since January 1, 2020, and the California State Attorney General began enforcement on July 1, 2020. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA and anticipate additional costs and expenses associated with CPRA compliance. Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. While the CCPA and CPRA contain an exception for certain activities involving PHI under HIPAA, we cannot yet determine the impact the CCPA, CPRA, or other such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. The collection and use of PHI in the EU is governed, as of May 25, 2018, by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR imposes several requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to the processing of health and other sensitive data, the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals regarding data processing activities, the notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and certain measures to be taken when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, including to the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States, may result in fines and other administrative penalties, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules, including as implemented by individual countries. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the “UK GDPR”). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to, the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The UK, however, is now regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR which means that transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognized by the EU’s GDPR, has been put in place. Although, under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement, it is lawful to transfer personal data between the UK and the EEA for a six-month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing). Compliance with the GDPR and the UK GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any future European or UK activities.
Failure to comply could result in penalties and interruption of our business should a violation occur.
We expect our product candidates, once approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, our product candidates may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in certain government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include information related to payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not preempted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
Environment
Our third-party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 302 full-time employees, of whom 218 are engaged in research and development and 84 in administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Geographically, 234 of our employees are located in Massachusetts, 44 are located in Colorado, and 22 work remotely in the U.S. Two of our employees are located in Germany.

In order to achieve our Company’s goals, it is paramount that we continue to attract and retain top talent. We seek to hire employees who are passionate about and will reflect our core values of dedication, equality, communication, excellence, respect, innovation, and accountability. Therefore, we strive to make Dicerna a diverse and inclusive environment, rich with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers and personally. Through our culture, we foster diversity and inclusion of all employees. “Equality” is one of our core values, and every month, a member of the executive leadership team nominates a team member who exemplifies our core values to promote and continue to foster the values throughout the employee population. We also donate to several non-profit organizations that aid people of various races and socioeconomic statuses to assist in reaching their career aspirations. We provide mandatory anti-harassment training, coaching, individualized training, management training, conference attendance, and financial support which includes tuition reimbursement. We also offer wellness programs and seminars to all employees and provide an on-site gym at one of our facilities in Lexington, Massachusetts.
We believe our employees are our greatest asset, and therefore, we compensate our employees competitively, striving to be in the 50th-60th percentile of our peers for total compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, our compensation and benefits program includes annual discretionary bonuses, equity awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, and family leave. Our annual bonus is based on the achievement of our corporate goals. 
Beginning in March 2020, we adapted our environment and practices to increase the safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, we have required COVID-19 safety training of all employees and have implemented numerous safety protocols, including a requirement to wear masks in all locations, training on the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and providing additional PPE while in our facilities, increasing cleaning efforts, and decreasing density and increasing physical distancing in our offices and laboratory, as well as requiring an online application to confirm no illness, symptoms, or exposure to COVID-19 for essential laboratory employees who need to be on-site. All other employees have been permitted to work from home since March 2020. In order to allow for employees to work productively from home, we provided a small subsidy for office equipment to all employees in 2020. To help our employees take care of their well-being, we began to offer three different exercise classes virtually each week. We also provided additional holidays and time off to allow employees to recharge.
