2. | Energy Services and Solutions 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have engaged in the research and development of alternative energy technologies and services primarily in electro-reduction of carbon dioxide (“ERC”) and mixed-reactant fuel cells (“MRFC”) through our subsidiary, Mantra Energy Alternatives Ltd. (“MEA”). We have paused development in moving these technologies toward commercial applications until further funding is received. These technologies are described as follows.
 

a) | Electro Reduction of Carbon Dioxide (“ERC”) is a certain chemical process for the electro-reduction of carbon dioxide which has been proven functional through small-scale prototype trials and limited scale-up trials. ERC offers a possible solution to reduce the impact of CO2 emissions on Earth’s environment by converting CO2 into chemicals with a broad range of commercial applications, including a fuel for a next generation of fuel cells. Powered by electricity, the ERC process combines captured carbon dioxide with water to produce materials, such as formic acid, formate salts, oxalic acid and methanol, that are conventionally obtained from the thermo-chemical processing of fossil fuels. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Mixed-Reactant Fuel Cell (MRFC) The MRFC is a novel fuel cell architecture that utilizes a mixture of the fuel and oxidant, and as a result, does not need a membrane. The MRFC has a simple reactant distribution mechanism, and contains no bipolar plates; as a result, the system is projected to be cheaper, lighter, and more robust than conventional fuel cells. The MRFC thus offers the potential to provide distributed or grid-connected clean, affordable heat and power. Being very versatile due to its simplicity, the MRFC can address several markets, including emergency backup power, stationary combined heat and power, industrial vehicles such as forklifts, and transportation. Our license to develop this technology was cancelled during the year. We do not know if we will be successful in restoring this license, and until we do, we do not intend to further develop this technology in the future. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c) | Energy Storage - Formate salts and formic acid, which can be produced from CO2 via ERC, are excellent energy carriers and effective fuels for the MRFC. Thus, the integration of ERC and MRFC represents an energy storage solution whereby intermittent renewable electricity can be stored as formate/formic acid when it is available, and liberated when it is needed. The availability of energy storage is widely recognized as the next most critical factor for increased renewables penetration. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not have any sales for energy services and solutions at this time and our activities have been primarily research and development. In the past, we have either contracted out our development work to various laboratories or carried out research and development on these technologies in our own laboratory in Vancouver, BC. These activities have included: experimentation to improve the process performance; process and economic modeling to optimize the costs of a commercial system; design and simulation of pilot systems for technology demonstration and validation; business development activities such as the establishment of strategic and technology development partners; and the design and fabrication of laboratory prototypes, among others.
 
Customers
 
Our customers include many Fortune 1000 enterprises, wireless and wireline service providers, cable broadband MSOs and telecommunications OEMs. Our current service provider and OEM customers include leading telecommunications companies, such as Ericsson, Inc., Verizon Communications, Sprint Nextel Corporation and AT&T.
 
Our top four customers, Crown Castle, High Performance Services LLC, Miami Dade County, USAC, accounted for approximately 72% of our total revenues from continuing telecommunications operations in the year ended May 31, 2017.
 
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from work performed under multi-year master service agreements and multi-year service contracts. We have entered into master service agreements, or MSAs, with numerous service providers and OEMs, and generally have multiple agreements with each of our customers. MSAs are generally the contracting vehicle with work awarded primarily through a competitive bidding process based on the depth of our service offerings, experience, price, geographic coverage and capacity. MSAs generally contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks, but do not require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services. To the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity, there are often a number of exceptions, including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers, perform work with the customer’s own employees and use other service providers. Most of our MSAs may be cancelled by our customers upon minimum notice (typically 60 days), regardless of whether we are or are not in default. In addition, many of these contracts permit cancellation of particular purchase orders or statements of work without any prior notice, but do allow for payment for services performed up to the point of hold or cancellation.
 
Suppliers and Vendors
 
We have supply agreements with major technology vendors and material supply houses. However, for a majority of the professional services we perform, our customers supply the necessary major equipment and materials. We expect to continue to further develop our relationships with our technology vendors and to broaden our scope of work with each of our partners. In many cases, our relationships with our partners have extended for over a decade, which we attribute to our commitment to excellence. It is our objective to selectively expand our partnerships moving forward in order to expand our service offerings.

Competitors
 
We provide professional and infrastructure services to carriers, service providers, utilities and enterprise clients on a national and international basis. Our primary business market is somewhat consolidated and the business is characterized by several large companies, as for the service providers to the telecommunication sector is somewhat fragmented with a significant number of small, privately-held, local competitors.
 
Our current and potential larger competitors include MasTec, Dycom Industries, Inc., Goodman Networks, Inc., Ericsson, and Black and Veatch. A significant portion of our services revenue is currently derived from MSAs and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements. Accordingly, our competitors may underbid us if they elect to price their services aggressively to procure such business. It must be recognized that while these companies are competitors, under the right circumstance they are also our clients or potential clients. Our competitors may also develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position based on threshold for margin and profitability thresholds established as benchmarks within our Telecommunications division. The principal competitive factors for our professional services include; agility to respond, geographic presence, breadth of service offerings, technical skills “in-house” professional licenses, price, quality of service, safety record, proven performance and industry reputation. We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of all of these factors.
 
Safety and Risk Management
 
We require our employees to participate in internal training and service programs from time to time relevant to their employment and to complete any training programs required by law. The telecommunications division has not had any OSHA recordable incidents, lost work days or fatalities since inception which includes: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and year-to-date 2017. Our policy is to review accidents and claims from our operations, examine trends and implement changes in procedures to address safety issues. We have no Claims in our business related to: workers’ compensation claims, general liability and damage claims, or claims related to vehicle accidents, including personal injury and property damage. We insure against the risk of loss arising from our operations up to certain deductible limits in all of the states in which we operate. In addition, we retain risk of loss, up to certain limits, under our employee group health plan. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to help ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage internally and externally for our clients.
 
Our internal policy is to carefully monitor claims and actively participate with our insurers in determining claims estimates and adjustments. The estimated costs of claims are accrued as liabilities, and include estimates for claims incurred but not reported. If we experience future insurance claims in excess of our umbrella coverage limit, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

Environmental Matters
 
A portion of the work related to the telecommunication division which is work associated with above ground and underground networks of our customers. As a result, we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects that may cause the release of hazardous materials or substances. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
