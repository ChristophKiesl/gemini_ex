(Estimated cost: $9,500,000. Estimated time to complete: eight months) and build solar system to power the greenhouse/ warehouse (Estimated cost: $3,000,000)
 
2. construct an additional total 23 acres of. greenhouse and associated warehouse space (Estimated cost: $45,500,000. Estimated time to complete: 36 months), and build a solar system to power the greenhouse and warehouse facilities (Estimated cost: $6,500,000)
 
The Company has a direct or indirect interest in the three entities listed above.
 
The Company plans to finance all or a part of the cost of retrofitting/ constructing greenhouses and warehouses and acquiring solar systems through the sale of Units offered by this report, future offering of the Company’s securities, proceeds from the exercise of the Company’s warrants or borrowings from private lenders.

Solar Energy Overview
 
Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.
 
There are three main ways to harness solar energy: photovoltaic, solar heating and cooling, and concentrating solar power. Photovoltaics generate electricity directly from sunlight via an electronic process and can be used to power anything from small electronics such as calculators and road signs up to homes and large commercial businesses. Solar heating and cooling (SHC) and concentrating solar power (CSP) applications both use the heat generated by the sun to provide space or water heating in the case of SHC systems, or to run traditional electricity-generating turbines in the case of CSP power plants.
 
Solar energy is a very flexible energy technology: it can be built as distributed generation (located at or near the point of use) or as a central-station, utility-scale solar power plant (similar to traditional power plants). Both of these methods can also store the energy they produce for distribution after the sun sets, using new solar and storage technologies.
 
In the last decade alone, solar has experienced an average annual growth rate of 48%. Thanks to strong federal policies like the solar Investment Tax Credit, rapidly declining costs, and increasing demand across the private and public sector for clean electricity, there are now nearly 78 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity installed nationwide, enough to power 14.5 million homes.
 
The cost to install solar has dropped by more than 70% over the last decade, leading the industry to expand into new markets and deploy thousands of systems nationwide. Prices as of June 2021 are at their lowest levels in history across all market segments.
 
Solar has ranked first or second in new electric capacity additions in each of the last years. In 2019, 40% of all new electric capacity added to the grid came from solar, the largest such share in history. Solar’s increasing competitiveness against other technologies has allowed it to quickly increase its share of total U.S. electrical generation - from just 0.1% in 2010 to more than 2.5% today.
 
Homeowners and businesses are increasingly demanding solar systems that are paired with battery storage. While this pairing is still relatively new, the growth over the next five years is expected to be significant. By 2025, more than 25% of all behind-the-meter solar systems will be paired with storage, compared to under 5% in 2019.
