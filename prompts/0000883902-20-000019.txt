Item 1. Business.
General
Cornerstone Building Brands, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise, the “Company,” “Cornerstone,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading North American integrated manufacturer of external building products for the commercial, residential, and repair and remodel construction industries. We design, engineer, and manufacture external building products through our three operating segments, Commercial, Siding, and Windows. 
In our Commercial segment, we design, engineer, manufacture and distribute extensive lines of metal products for the nonresidential construction market under multiple brand names through a nationwide network of plants and distribution centers. We offer a number of advantages over traditional construction alternatives, including shorter construction time, more efficient use of materials, lower construction costs, greater ease of expansion and lower maintenance costs. Our Commercial segment also provides metal coil coating services for commercial and construction applications, servicing both internal and external customers. We sell our products for both new construction and repair and retrofit applications. 
In our Siding segment, our principal products include vinyl siding and skirting, steel siding, vinyl and aluminum soffit, aluminum trim coil, aluminum gutter coil, aluminum gutters, aluminum and steel roofing accessories, cellular PVC trim and mouldings, J-channels, wide crown molding, window and door trim, F-channels, H-molds, fascia, undersill trims, outside/inside corner posts, rain removal systems, injection molded designer accents such as shakes, shingles, scallops, shutters, vents and mounts, vinyl fence, vinyl railing, and stone veneer in the United States and Canada. The breadth of our product lines and our multiple brand and price point strategy enable us to target multiple distribution channels (wholesale and specialty distributors, retailers and manufactured housing) and end users (new construction and home repair and remodeling).
 In our Windows segment, our principal products include vinyl, aluminum-clad vinyl, aluminum, wood and clad-wood windows and patio doors and steel, wood, and fiberglass entry doors that serve both the new construction and the home repair and remodeling sectors in the United States and Canada. We continue introducing new products to the portfolio which allow us to enter or further penetrate new distribution channels and customers. The breadth of our product lines and our multiple price point strategy enable us to target multiple distribution channels (wholesale and specialty distributors, retailers and manufactured housing) and end user markets (new construction and home repair and remodeling).
NCI Building Systems, Inc. ("NCI") was founded in 1984 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1991. In 1998, we acquired Metal Building Components, Inc. (“MBCI”) and we became the largest domestic manufacturer of nonresidential metal components. In 2006, we acquired Robertson-Ceco II Corporation (“RCC”) which operates the Ceco Building Systems, Star Building Systems and Robertson Building Systems divisions and was a leader in the metal buildings industry. The RCC acquisition created an organization with greater product and geographic diversification, a stronger customer base and a more extensive distribution network than either company had individually, prior to the acquisition.
Since 2011, we executed on a strategy to become the leading provider of Insulated Metal Panels ("IMP") products in North America through our acquisitions of Metl-Span LLC (‘‘Metl-Span’’) in 2012 and CENTRIA, a Pennsylvania general partnership (‘‘CENTRIA’’), in 2015. IMP products possess several physical and cost-effective attributes, such as energy efficiency, that make them compelling alternatives to competing building materials, in particular due to the adoption of stricter standards and codes by numerous states in the United States that are expected to increase the use of IMP products in construction projects. Given these factors, we believe that growth within the IMP market will continue to outpace the broader metal building sector and the nonresidential construction industry as a whole.
At a Special Meeting of the shareholders of NCI held on November 15, 2018 (the “Special Shareholder Meeting”), NCI’s shareholders approved (i) the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) among NCI, Ply Gem Parent, LLC (“Ply Gem”), and for certain limited purposes set forth in the Merger Agreement, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, pursuant to which, at the closing of the merger, Ply Gem was merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing its existence as a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Merger”) and (ii) the issuance in the Merger of 58,709,067 shares of NCI common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “NCI Common Stock”) in the aggregate, on a pro rata basis, to the holders of all of the equity interests in Ply Gem (the “Stock Issuance”). The Merger was consummated on November 16, 2018 pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on November 16, 2018, the Company entered into (i) a stockholders agreement (the “New Stockholders Agreement”) between the Company and each of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Fund VIII, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“CD&R Fund VIII”), CD&R Friends & Family Fund VIII, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“CD&R FF Fund VIII”, and together with CD&R Fund VIII, the “CD&R Fund VIII Investor Group”), CD&R Pisces Holdings, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“CD&R Pisces”, and together with CD&R Fund VIII and CD&R FF Fund VIII, individually, the “CD&R Investors,” and collectively, the “CD&R Investor Group”), Atrium Intermediate Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Atrium”), GGC BP Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“GGC”), and AIC Finance Partnership, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“AIC”, and together with Atrium and GGC, each individually, a “Golden Gate Investor,” and collectively, the “Golden Gate Investor Group,” and together with the CD&R Investor Group, the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Company granted to the Investors certain governance, preemptive and subscription rights and (ii) a registration rights agreement (the “New Registration Rights Agreement”) with the Investors, pursuant to which the Company granted the Investors customary demand and piggyback registration rights, including rights to demand registrations and underwritten shelf registration statement offerings with respect to the shares of NCI Common Stock that are held by the Investors following the consummation of the Merger.
On November 16, 2018, in connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Company assumed (i) the obligations of the company formerly known as Ply Gem Midco, Inc. (“Ply Gem Midco”), a subsidiary of Ply Gem immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, as borrower under the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement, (ii) the obligations of Ply Gem Midco as parent borrower under the Current ABL Credit Agreement and (iii) the obligations of Ply Gem Midco as issuer under the Current Indenture (each as defined and further described in "Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations").
On January 12, 2019, the Company entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Environmental Materials, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Environmental Stoneworks” or “ESW”), the Members of Environmental Materials, LLC (the “Sellers”) and Charles P. Gallagher and Wayne C. Kocourek, solely in their capacity as the Seller Representative (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which, on February 20, 2019, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ply Gem Industries, Inc., purchased from the Sellers 100% of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Environmental Stoneworks (the “Environmental Stoneworks Acquisition”). The transaction was financed through borrowings under the Company’s asset-based revolving credit facility. The Environmental Stoneworks Acquisition, when combined with the Company’s existing stone businesses, positions the Company as a market leader in stone veneer. 
For additional discussion of the Company’s debt following the Merger, see “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Segments
Our operating segments operate primarily in the commercial, residential, and repair and remodeling construction markets. Sales and earnings are influenced by general economic conditions, commodity prices and the level of construction activity. 
Commercial
Products
In our Commercial segment, we design, engineer, manufacture and distribute extensive lines of metal products for the nonresidential construction market under multiple brand names through a nationwide network of plants and distribution centers. We offer a number of advantages over traditional construction alternatives, including shorter construction time, more efficient use of materials, lower construction costs, greater ease of expansion and lower maintenance costs. Our Commercial segment also provides metal coil coating services for commercial and construction applications, servicing both internal and external customers. We sell our products for both new construction and repair and retrofit applications.
Coil Coatings – Our complete line of coating finishes includes Epoxies, Acrylics, Polyesters, Silicone Modified Polyesters (SMP), Flurocarbons (PVDF), and Plastisol for light-gauge and heavy-gauge steel coil applications. As one of the largest coil coaters in the country, Metal Coaters specializes in the toll processing of customer-owned light gauge metal to deliver coil coating solutions throughout the United States. Metal Prep is one of the largest providers of pre-painted Hot Rolled Steel in the United States and provides heavy gauge coil coating solutions to the construction industry. We sell our products and processes principally to original equipment manufacturer customers who utilize pre-painted metal, including other manufacturers of engineered building systems and metal components. Our customer base also includes steel mills, metal service centers and painted coil distributors who in-turn supply various manufacturers of engineered building systems, metal components, lighting fixtures, ceiling grids, water heaters, appliances and other manufactured products.
Doors – From steel curtain roll-up and self-storage doors to complete hallway systems, our products are fabricated to meet or exceed operational requirements with little to no maintenance. Our doors are used across the country in freight terminals, commercial buildings, self-storage facilities, and more. Commercial grade steel curtain roll-up doors, self-storage doors, and hallway systems are sold directly to contractors and other customers under the brand “Doors and Buildings Components” (“DBCI”). 
Insulated Metal Panels – Insulated Metal Panels act simultaneously as exterior wall, insulation, and finished interior wall, offering protection over the lifespan of a building. Insulated metal panels are panels consisting of rigid foam encased between two sheets of coated metal in a variety of modules, lengths and reveal combinations and are increasingly desirable because of their energy efficiency, noise reduction and aesthetic qualities. We design, manufacture, sell and distribute insulated metal panels for use in various architectural, commercial, industrial and cold storage end market applications under the brand names “Metl-Span” and “CENTRIA”. 
Metal Building Systems – Metal building systems consist of engineered structural members and panels that are fabricated and roll-formed in a factory. These systems are custom designed and engineered to meet project requirements and then shipped to a construction site complete and ready for assembly with no additional field welding required. Engineered building systems manufacturers design an integrated system that meets applicable building code and designated end use requirements. These systems consist of primary structural framing, secondary structural members (purlins and girts) and metal roof and wall systems or conventional wall materials manufactured by others, such as masonry and concrete tilt-up panels. We sell engineered building systems to builders, general contractors, developers and end users nationwide under the brand names “Metallic,” “Mid-West Steel Building Company,” “A & S,” “All American,” “Mesco,” “Star,” “Ceco,” “Robertson,” “Garco,” “Heritage” and “SteelBuilding.com.” We market engineered building systems through an in-house sales force to affiliated builder networks of approximately 3,200 builders. We also sell engineered building systems via direct sale to owners and end users as well as through private label companies. The majority of our sales of engineered building systems are made through our authorized builder networks. We enter into an authorized builder agreement with independent general contractors that market our products and services to users. These agreements generally grant the builder the non-exclusive right to market our products in a specified territory. Generally, the agreement is cancelable by either party with between 30 and 60 days’ notice. The agreement does not prohibit the builder from marketing engineered building systems of other manufacturers. In some cases, we may defray a portion of the builder’s advertising costs and provide volume purchasing and other pricing incentives to encourage those businesses to deal exclusively or principally with us. The builder is required to maintain a place of business in its designated territory, provide a sales organization, conduct periodic advertising programs and perform construction, warranty and other services for customers and potential customers. An authorized builder usually is hired by an end-user to erect an engineered building system on the customer’s site and provide general contracting, subcontracting and/or other services related to the completion of the project. We sell our products to the builder, which generally includes the price of the building as a part of its overall construction contract with its customer.
Metal Roofing and Wall Systems - Metal roofing and wall systems, metal partitions, metal trim, doors and other related accessories. These products are used in new construction and in repair and retrofit applications for industrial, commercial, institutional, agricultural and rural uses. Metal components are used in a wide variety of construction applications, including purlins and girts, roofing, standing seam roofing, walls, doors, trim and other parts of traditional buildings, as well as in architectural applications and engineered building systems. We sell roofing and wall systems directly to regional manufacturers, contractors, subcontractors, distributors, lumberyards, cooperative buying groups and other customers under the brand names “MBCI”, “American Building Components” (“ABC”), and “Metal Depots.” We sell directly to contractors or end users for use in the building industry, including the construction of metal buildings. We also stock and market metal component parts for use in the maintenance and repair of existing buildings. Specific component products we manufacture include metal roof and wall systems, purlins, girts, partitions, header panels and related trim and screws. We market our components products primarily within six market segments: commercial/industrial, architectural, standing seam roof systems, agricultural, residential and cold storage. Customers include small, medium and large contractors, specialty roofers, regional fabricators, regional engineered building fabricators, post frame contractors, material resellers and end users.
Raw materials and suppliers
The principal raw material used in manufacturing of our metal components and engineered building systems is steel which we purchase from multiple steel producers. Our various products are fabricated from steel produced by mills including bars, plates, structural shapes, hot-rolled coils and galvanized or Galvalume®-coated coils (Galvalume® is a registered trademark of BIEC International, Inc.).
The price and supply of steel impacts our business. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature, and steel prices have been volatile in recent years and may remain volatile in the future. Steel prices are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions domestically and internationally, currency fluctuations, the availability of raw materials, competition, labor costs, freight and transportation costs, production costs, import duties and other trade restrictions. Based on the cyclical nature of the steel industry, we expect steel prices will continue to be volatile.
Although we have the ability to purchase steel from a number of suppliers, a production cutback by one or more of our current suppliers could create challenges in meeting delivery schedules to our customers. Because we have periodically adjusted our contract prices, particularly in the engineered building systems segment, we have generally been able to pass increases in our raw material costs through to our customers. We normally do not maintain an inventory of steel in excess of our current production requirements. However, from time to time, we may purchase steel in advance of announced steel price increases. 
Competition
We and other manufacturers of metal components and engineered building systems compete in the building industry with all other alternative methods of building construction such as tilt-wall, concrete and wood, single-ply and built up, all of which may be perceived as more traditional, more aesthetically pleasing or having other advantages over our products. 
In addition, competition in the metal components and engineered building systems market of the building industry is intense. We believe it is based primarily on:
•quality;
•service;
•on-time delivery;
•ability to provide added value in the design and engineering of buildings;
•price;
•speed of construction; and
•personal relationships with customers.
We compete with a number of other manufacturers of metal components, metal coil coaters, and engineered building systems for the building industry, including Nucor, Bluescope, Mueller, Kingspan, and Central States. Many of these competitors operate on a regional basis. We have two primary nationwide competitors in the engineered building systems market and three primary nationwide competitors in the metal components market. However, the metal components market is more fragmented than the engineered building systems market.
As of December 31, 2019, we operated 37 manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Mexico and Canada, with additional sales and distribution offices throughout the United States and Canada. These facilities are used primarily for the manufacturing of metal components and engineered building systems for the building industry. We believe this broad geographic distribution gives us an advantage over our metal components and engineered building systems competitors because major elements of a customer’s decision are the speed and cost of delivery from the manufacturing facility to the product’s ultimate destination. We operate a fleet of trucks to deliver our products to our customers in a more timely manner than most of our competitors.
Intellectual property
We have a number of United States patents, pending patent applications and other proprietary rights, including those relating to metal roofing systems, metal overhead doors, our pier and header system, our Long Bay® System and our building estimating and design system. The patents on our Long Bay® System expire in 2021. We also have several registered trademarks and pending registrations in the United States.
Seasonality
The Commercial business, and the construction industry in general, are seasonal in nature. Sales normally are lower in the first half of each fiscal year compared to the second half of each fiscal year because of unfavorable weather conditions for construction and typical business planning cycles affecting construction.
Backlog
At December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the total backlog of orders, consisting of Engineered Building Systems’ and IMP orders, for our products was $608.0 million and $528.8 million, respectively. Job orders included in backlog are generally cancelable by customers at any time for any reason; however, cancellation charges may be assessed. Occasionally, orders in the backlog are not completed and shipped for reasons that include changes in the requirements of the customers and the inability of customers to obtain necessary financing or zoning variances. We anticipate that less than 23% of this backlog will extend beyond one year.
Siding
Products
In our Siding segment, our principal products include vinyl siding and skirting, steel siding, vinyl and aluminum soffit, aluminum trim coil, aluminum gutter coil, fabricated aluminum gutters, aluminum and steel roofing accessories, cellular PVC trim and mouldings, J-channels, wide crown molding, window and door trim, F-channels, H-molds, fascia, undersill trims, outside/inside corner posts, rain removal systems, injection molded designer accents such as shakes, shingles, scallops, shutters, vents and mounts, vinyl fence, vinyl railing, and stone veneer in the United States and Canada. We sell our siding and accessories under our Variform®, Napco®, Mastic® Home Exteriors, Mitten®, Ply Gem/Cellwood®, and Durabuilt® brand names and under the Georgia-Pacific brand name through a private label program. Our cellular PVC Trim products are sold under our Ply Gem® Trim and Mouldings brand name. Our vinyl fencing and railing products are sold under the Ply Gem brand name. Our stone veneer products are sold under our Environmental Stoneworks, Canyon Stone and Ply Gem Stone brand names. Our gutter protection products are sold under our Leaf Relief®, Leaf Relief® Snap Tight, Leaf Smart® and Leaf Logic® brand names. The breadth of our product lines shown below and our multiple brand and price point strategy enable us to target multiple distribution channels (wholesale and specialty distributors, retailers and manufactured housing) and end users (new construction and home repair and remodeling).

Customers and distribution
We have a multi-channel distribution network that serves both the new construction and the home repair and remodeling sectors, which exhibit different, often counter-balancing, demand characteristics. In conjunction with our multiple brand and price point strategy, we believe our multi-channel distribution strategy enables us to increase our sales and sector penetration 
while minimizing channel conflict. We believe our strategy reduces our dependence on any one channel, which provides us with a greater ability to sustain our financial performance through economic fluctuations.
We sell our siding and accessories to specialty distributors (one-step distribution) and to wholesale distributors (two-step distribution). Our specialty distributors sell directly to remodeling contractors and builders. Our wholesale distributors sell to retail home centers and lumberyards who, in turn, sell to remodeling contractors, builders and consumers. In the specialty channel, we have developed an extensive network of approximately 800 independent distributors, serving over 22,000 contractors and builders nationwide. We are well-positioned in this channel as many of these distributors are both the largest and leading consolidators in the industry. In the wholesale channel, we are the sole supplier of vinyl siding and accessories to BlueLinx (formerly a distribution operation of the Georgia-Pacific Corporation), one of the largest building products distributors in the United States. Through BlueLinx, our Georgia-Pacific private label vinyl siding products are sold at major retail home centers, lumberyards and manufactured housing manufacturers. A portion of our siding and accessories is also sold directly to home improvement centers. Our growing customer base of fencing and railing consists of fabricators, distributors, retail home centers and lumberyards. Our customer base of stone veneer products consists of distributors, lumberyards and retailers. We also sell to builders and contractors with a distinct turnkey model that provides product and installation services. In Canada, our complete offering of vinyl siding, accessories, trim, and moldings, along with Ply Gem manufactured and third party sourced complimentary products are primarily distributed through our 18 Mitten branch locations, to retail home centers and lumberyards, and new construction and remodeling contractors.
Production and facilities
Vinyl siding, skirting, soffit and accessories are manufactured in our Martinsburg, West Virginia, Jasper, Tennessee, Stuarts Draft, Virginia, Kearney, Missouri, and Paris, Ontario facilities, while all metal products are produced in our Sidney, Ohio facility. The majority of our injection molded products such as shakes, shingles, scallops, shutters, vents and mounts are manufactured in our Gaffney, South Carolina facility. The cellular polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") trim and mouldings products are manufactured in St. Marys, West Virginia. The vinyl, metal, and injected molded plants have sufficient capacity to support planned levels of sales growth for the foreseeable future. Our fencing and railing products are currently manufactured at our York, Nebraska facility. The fencing and railing plants have sufficient capacity to support our planned sales growth for the foreseeable future. Our stone veneer products are manufactured at our Olathe, Kansas, Denver, Colorado, Mabletown, Georgia, Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania, Selingsgrove, Pennsylvania, North Branch, Minnesota and St. George, Utah facilities. Our manufacturing facilities are among the safest in all of North America with three of them having received the highest federal and/or state OSHA safety award and rating.
Raw materials and suppliers
PVC resin and aluminum are major components in the production of our siding, fencing, and stone products. PVC resin and aluminum are commodity products and are available from both domestic and international suppliers. We are one of the largest consumers of PVC resin in North America and we continue to leverage our purchasing power on this key raw material. Changes in PVC resin and aluminum prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold. Historically, we have been able to pass on the price increases to our customers. The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.
Competition
We compete with other national and regional manufacturers of vinyl siding, aluminum, cellular PVC, fencing, and stone products. We believe we are currently the largest manufacturer of vinyl siding in North America. Our vinyl siding competitors include CertainTeed, Alside, Royal Building Products and smaller regional competitors. Our aluminum accessories competitors include Rollex, Euramax, Gentek and other smaller regional competitors. Significant growth in vinyl fencing and railing has attracted many new entrants, and the sector today is fragmented with numerous competitors including U.S. Fence, Homeland, Westech, Bufftech, and Azek. Our cellular PVC trim and moulding competitors include Azek, Inteplast, Kommerling (KOMA), Wolfpac (Versatex), Tapco (Kleer), CertainTeed and Royal Building Products. Our stone veneer competitors include Boral (Cultured Stone and Eldorado Stone), Coronado Stone and smaller regional competitors. Our stone competitive advantage is that we provide a full, turnkey solution including manufacturing, distribution and installation services direct to builders and general contractors. We also compete on product quality, breadth of product offering, sales and service support. In addition to competition from other vinyl siding, fencing and stone products, our products face competition from alternative materials, such as wood, metal, fiber cement and masonry. Increases in competition from other exterior building products manufacturers and alternative building materials could cause us to lose customers and lead to net sales decreases.
Intellectual property
We possess a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, tradenames, licenses, proprietary technology and know-how and other proprietary rights. In connection with the marketing of our products, we generally obtain trademark protection for our brand names in the Siding segment. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We license the Georgia-Pacific trademark for our Georgia-Pacific private label vinyl siding products sold through BlueLinx. While we do not believe the Siding segment is dependent on any one of our trademarks, we believe that our trademarks are important to the development and conduct of our business as well as the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect all of our intellectual property rights.
Seasonality
Markets for our products in the Siding segment are seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions. Historically, our business has experienced increased sales in the second and third quarters of the year due to increased construction during those periods. Because a portion of our overhead and expenses are fixed throughout the year, our operating profits tend to be lower in the first and fourth quarters. Inclement weather conditions can affect the timing of when our products are applied or installed, causing delayed profit margins when such conditions exist.
We generally carry increased working capital during the first half of a fiscal year to support those months where customer demand exceeds production capacity. We believe that this is typical within the siding industry.
Backlog
Our Siding segment had a backlog of approximately $66.0 million at December 31, 2019. We expect to fill 100% of the orders during 2020 that were included in our backlog at December 31, 2019.
Windows
Products
In our Windows segment, our principal products include vinyl, aluminum-clad vinyl, aluminum, wood and clad-wood windows and patio doors and steel, wood, and fiberglass entry doors that serve both the new construction and the home repair and remodeling sectors in the United States and Canada. Our products in our Windows segment are sold under the Ply Gem® Windows, Simonton® Windows, Great Lakes® Window, Atrium Windows, American Craftsman, Silver Line, North Star, Tru Bilt and Ply Gem® Canada brands. We continue introducing new products to the portfolio which allow us to enter or further penetrate new distribution channels and customers. The breadth of our product lines shown below and our multiple price point strategy enable us to target multiple distribution channels (wholesale and specialty distributors, retailers and manufactured housing) and end user markets (new construction and home repair and remodeling).

Customers and distribution
We have a multi-channel distribution and product strategy that enables us to serve both the new construction and the home repair and remodeling markets. By offering this broad product offering and industry leading service, we are able to meet the local needs of our customers on a national scale. This strategy has enabled our customer base (existing and new) to simplify their supply chain by consolidating window suppliers. Our "good, better, best" product and price point strategy allows us to increase our sales and sector penetration while minimizing channel conflict. This strategy reduces our dependence on any one channel, providing us with a greater ability to sustain our financial performance through economic fluctuations.
The new construction product lines are sold for use in new residential and light commercial construction through a highly diversified customer base, which includes independent building material dealers, regional/national lumberyard chains, builder direct/OEMs and retail home centers. Our repair and remodeling window products are primarily sold through independent home improvement dealers, one-step distributors, and big box retail outlets. Dealers typically market directly to homeowners or contractors in connection with remodeling requirements while distributors concentrate on local independent retailers.
In Canada, sales of product lines for new construction are predominantly made through direct sales to builders and contractors, while sales for repair and remodeling are made primarily through retail lumberyards, independent home improvement dealers and direct to consumers through our supply and install services. Ply Gem Canada products are distributed through twelve Ply Gem Canada distribution centers.
Production and facilities
Our window and door products leverage a network of vertically integrated production and distribution facilities located in Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, California, Washington, West Virginia, Illinois, New Jersey, Ontario, Canada and Alberta, Canada. Our window manufacturing facilities have benefited from our continued investment and commitment to product development and product quality combined with increasing integration of best practices across our product offerings. In 2010, we began producing vinyl compound for our west coast facilities which improved our operating efficiency and resulted in lower production cost for these items. We continued making upgrades to the automation of our production lines.
While market conditions will dictate future capacity requirements, we have the ability to increase capacity in a cost effective manner by expanding production shifts and lines. Significant housing demand increases to historical levels may require additional capital investment in certain geographical areas to meet this increased demand. Any capacity increase may, however, initially be offset by labor inefficiencies or difficulties obtaining the appropriate labor force. Ongoing capital investments will focus on new product introductions and simplification, production automation, equipment maintenance and cost reductions.
Raw materials and suppliers
PVC compound, wood, aluminum and glass are major components in the production of our window and door products. These products are commodity products available from both domestic and international suppliers. Historically, changes in PVC compound, aluminum billet, glass and wood cutstock prices have had the most significant impact on our material cost of products sold in our Windows segment. We are one of the largest consumers of PVC resin in North America and we continue to leverage our purchasing power on this key raw material. The PVC resin compound that is used in our window lineal production is produced internally. The leveraging of our PVC resin buying power and our PVC resin compounding capabilities benefits all of our window companies. Our window plants have consolidated glass purchases to take advantage of strategic sourcing savings opportunities. In addition, we have continued to vertically integrate aluminum extrusion in our window plants.
Competition
The window and patio door sector remains fragmented, comprised primarily of local and regional manufacturers with limited product offerings. The sector’s competitors in the United States include national brands, such as Jeld-Wen, Pella, MI Home Products and Andersen, and other regional brands, including Weathershield and others. Competitors in Canada include Jeld-Wen, All Weather, Durabuilt, Vinylbilt and numerous regional brands. We generally compete on service, product performance, product offering, sales and support. We believe all of our products are competitively priced and that we are one of the only manufacturers to serve all end markets and price points.
Intellectual property
We possess a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, tradenames, licenses, proprietary technology and know-how and other proprietary rights. In connection with the marketing of our products, we generally obtain trademark protection for our brand names in the Windows segment. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not become generic. Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. While we do not believe the Windows segment is dependent on any one of our trademarks, we believe that our trademarks are important to the Windows segment and the development and conduct of our business as well as the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect all of our intellectual property rights.
Seasonality
Markets for our products in the Windows segment are seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions. Historically, our business has experienced increased sales in the second and third quarters of the year due to increased construction during those periods. Accordingly, our working capital is typically higher in the second and third quarters as well. Because much of our overhead and expense are fixed throughout the year, our operating profits tend to be lower in the first and fourth quarters. Inclement weather conditions can affect the timing of when our products are applied or installed, causing lower profit margins when such conditions exist.
Because we have successfully implemented lean manufacturing techniques and many of our windows and doors are made to order, inventories in our Windows segment do not change significantly with seasonal demand.
Backlog
Our Windows segment had a backlog of approximately $100.9 million at December 31, 2019. We expect to fill 100% of the orders during 2020 that were included in our backlog at December 31, 2019.
Business Strategy
Cornerstone Building Brands is relentlessly committed to our customers and to creating great building solutions that enable communities to grow and thrive. By focusing on operational excellence every day, creating a platform for future growth and investing in market-leading residential and commercial building brands, we deliver unparalleled financial results. We want to play an essential role in our communities where people live, work and play to enable those communities to grow and thrive. 
The Company's strategy has several primary elements:
Profitable Growth. The Company intends to expand into new and existing markets by leveraging its customer relationships and full portfolio of leading products. We believe we have a meaningful opportunity for organic growth through product line extension, innovation of new systems and cross selling of products to deepen penetration across our customer channels. Using a highly collaborative selling approach, the Company intends to grow in attractive market sectors, emphasizing those spaces that are highly fragmented, demand high service and value the reliability and efficiency offered by Cornerstone Building Brand products. 
Operational Excellence. Cornerstone Building Brands operates with a relentless drive for exceptional results and a passion for superior execution. The Company embraces a continuous improvement culture that is charged with increasing efficiency, optimizing costs, eliminating waste, encouraging organizational agility and building greater brand equity to fuel growth. This requires the Company’s ongoing commitment to attract, retain and develop the best talent. This also includes making investments in automation within our manufacturing facilities, transforming the way work gets done, and deploying capital in ways we believe will drive the greatest returns for our shareholders over the long-term.
Capital Deployment to Drive Shareholder Value. The Company is intently focused on providing the highest returns for shareholders through its capital allocation framework, which includes: (1) investing in the core business through capital expenditures and other organic growth initiatives; (2) pursuing strategic acquisitions to broaden its portfolio and capabilities across the residential and commercial markets, with a focus on adjacent exterior building products and related services; and (3) targeting long-term net debt leverage of 2.0x to 2.5x. As part of this framework, the Company may also restructure, reposition or divest underperforming product lines or assets.
Restructuring
We continue to execute on our plans to improve cost efficiency through the optimization of our combined manufacturing plant footprint and the elimination of certain fixed and indirect SG&A costs. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $18.1 million. See Note 5 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Consolidation
Over the last several years, there has been a consolidation of competitors within the industries of the engineered building systems, metal components, insulated metal panels, metal coil coating, and windows, which include many small local and regional firms. We believe that these industries will continue to consolidate, driven by the needs of manufacturers to increase anticipated long-term manufacturing capacity, achieve greater process integration, add geographic diversity to meet customers’ product and delivery needs, improve production efficiency and manage costs. The vinyl siding industry has already largely consolidated with four companies comprising approximately 90% of the market. When beneficial to our long-term goals and strategy, we have sought to consolidate our business operations with other companies. The resulting synergies from these consolidation efforts have allowed us to reduce costs while continuing to serve our customers’ needs. For more information, see “Acquisitions” below. For a discussion of the possible effects on us of such consolidations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Acquisitions
We have a history of making strategic acquisitions within our industry, including the Metl-Span Acquisition, the CENTRIA Acquisition, the Merger and the ESW Acquisition, and we regularly evaluate growth opportunities both through acquisitions and internal investment. We believe that there remain opportunities for growth through consolidation in the Commercial, Siding and Windows segments, and our goal is to continue to grow organically and through opportunistic strategic acquisitions that meet our strict criteria.
Consistent with our growth strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase by us of businesses, assets and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. Such acquisition efforts may involve participation by us in processes that have been made public, involve a number of potential buyers and are commonly referred to as “auction” processes, as well as situations in which we believe we are the only party or one of the very limited number of potential buyers in negotiations with the potential seller. These acquisition efforts often involve assets that, if acquired, would have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We also evaluate from time to time possible dispositions of assets or businesses when such assets or businesses are no longer core to our operations and do not fit into our long-term strategy.
The Company’s debt agreements contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, transfer or sell assets, make acquisitions and engage in mergers. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Debt.”
Environmental Matters, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws. Among other things, these laws regulate the emissions or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of our employees and the end-users of our products, regulate the materials used in our products, and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating (as well as other damages resulting from) present and past releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws or of any conditions contained in environmental permits can result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, requirements to install pollution or other controls or equipment, and civil sanctions.
We could be held liable for costs to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site, or at other sites where we or predecessors may have released hazardous materials. We could incur fines, penalties or sanctions or be subject to third-party claims, including indemnification claims, for property damage, personal injury or otherwise as a result of violations of (or liabilities under) environmental, health and safety laws, or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials.
Changes in or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future including additional investigation, remediation or other obligations with respect to our products or business activities or the imposition of new permit requirements may lead to additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws requires us to incur capital expenditures and increases our operating costs. We do not believe that compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, including existing requirements to investigate and remediate contamination, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or manufacturing processes.
The following are representative environmental, health and safety requirements relating to our operations:
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws. These laws govern emissions of air pollutants from industrial stationary sources, such as our manufacturing facilities, and impose various permitting, air pollution control, emissions monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Such laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for constructing or modifying our facilities in ways that have the potential to produce new or increased air emissions, obtain and comply with operating permits that limit air emissions or certain operating parameters, or employ best available control technologies to reduce or minimize emissions from our facilities. We may be required to purchase air pollution control equipment in order to comply with air emissions laws.
Greenhouse Gases. Concern over the effects of global climate change has led to federal, state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions. While GHG regulations do not currently affect our facilities, more stringent federal, regional, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to global climate change and GHG emissions may be adopted in the future. These laws and regulations could impact our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our products, and our customers’ businesses, which could reduce demand for our products or cause us to incur additional capital, operating or other costs. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future legislation or regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our business. In addition, global climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms, floods, extreme temperatures and other events that could affect our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our products, and demand for our products.
 Hazardous and Solid Industrial Waste. Our operations generate industrial solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state laws. RCRA imposes requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. Industrial wastes we generate in our manufacturing processes, such as used chemicals, may be regulated as hazardous waste, although RCRA has provisions to exempt some of our wastes from classification as hazardous waste. However, our non-hazardous or exempted industrial wastes are still regulated under state law or the less stringent industrial solid waste requirements of RCRA. 
RCRA Corrective Action Program. Certain facilities may be subject to the Corrective Action Program under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by RCRA, and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (Corrective Action Program). The Corrective Action Program is designed to ensure that certain facilities subject to RCRA have investigated and remediated releases of hazardous substances at their property.
MW Manufacturers Inc. (MW), a subsidiary of Ply Gem Industries, Inc., entered into a September 2011 Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA under the Corrective Action Program to address known releases of hazardous substances at MW’s Rocky Mount, Virginia property. A Phase I RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) was submitted to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) in December 2015, and a Phase II RFI and the Human Health Risk Assessment and Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment were submitted in October 2018. A Limited Corrective Measures Study (LCMS) based on the investigations was submitted to the VDEQ for review and approval in September 2019. We have recorded a liability of $4.5 million for this MW site within other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019.
CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA (commonly known as Superfund), and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. These include the current and past owners or operators of sites where hazardous substances were released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at off-site locations such as landfills. CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in certain cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health and welfare or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible parties remediation costs. 
We currently own or lease, and historically owned or leased, numerous properties that have extensive histories of industrial operations. Hazardous substances may have been released on, under or from these properties, or on, under or from other locations where hazardous wastes have been disposed. Some of these properties have been owned or operated by third parties who may have released hazardous substances for which we could have liability. We could be required to investigate or remediate contaminated property, perform remedial closure activities, or assess and remediate volatile chemical vapors migrating from soil or groundwater into overlying buildings. Our liability for investigating and remediating contamination could be joint and several and could include damages for impacts to natural resources.
The EPA is investigating groundwater contamination at a Superfund site in York, Nebraska, referred to as the PCE/TCE Northeast Contamination Site (PCE/TCE Site). Kroy Building Products, Inc. (KBP), a subsidiary of Ply Gem Industries, Inc., has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the site and has liability for investigation and remediation costs associated with the contamination. On May 17, 2019, KBP and an unrelated respondent, Kroy Industries, Inc., entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to conduct a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of the PCE/TCE Site. A final RI/FS Work Plan was submitted to EPA in November 2019 and approved in December 2019. RI Phase I field work is scheduled to be conducted in 2020. We have recorded a liability of $4.6 million for the PCE/TCE Site within other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019. We will adjust our remediation liability in future periods, if necessary, as the RI/FS progresses or if additional requirements are imposed. We may be able to recover a portion of costs incurred in connection with the PCE/TCE Site from other parties, though there is no assurance we would receive any funds.
Wastewater Discharges. Our operations are subject to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, or CWA, and analogous state laws. These laws impose requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants from industrial activity into waters of the United States. Such laws may require that we comply with stormwater runoff and wastewater discharge standards or obtain permits limiting our discharges of pollutants. Failure to comply with CWA requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, restrictions on operations, and administrative or civil enforcement actions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for wastewater discharge or stormwater runoff treatment technology to comply with wastewater permits and water quality standards. 
Employee Health and Safety. We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our workers. Among other things, we are required to maintain and make available to our employees, state and local government authorities, and others information about hazardous materials used or produced by our operations.
Zoning and Building Code Requirements
The engineered building systems and components we manufacture must meet zoning, building code and uplift requirements adopted by local governmental agencies. We believe that our products are in substantial compliance with applicable zoning, code and uplift requirements. Compliance does not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Research and Development Costs
Total expenditures for research and development were $14.2 million, $3.5 million and $4.3 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We incur research and development costs to develop new products, improve existing products and improve safety factors of our products.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately 20,100 employees, of whom approximately 17,200 are manufacturing and engineering personnel. We regard our employee relations as satisfactory. Approximately 12% of our workforce are represented by a collective bargaining agreement or union, which primarily includes the employees at our subsidiary in Mexico, our plant in Calgary, Alberta and our North Brunswick, New Jersey plant.
