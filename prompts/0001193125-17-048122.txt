Company Overview 
 We are a Canadian corporation originally formed on August 25, 2014 to serve as the indirect holding company for Tim Hortons and its consolidated subsidiaries and for Burger King and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the worlds largest quick service restaurant (QSR) companies with more than $24 billion in system-wide sales and over 20,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries and U.S. territories as of December 31, 2016. Our Tim Hortons® and Burger King® brands have similar franchise business models with complementary daypart mixes. Our two iconic brands are managed independently while benefitting from global scale and sharing of best practices. 
Our Tim Hortons Brand 
 Founded in 1964, Tim Hortons is one of the largest restaurant chains in North America and the largest in Canada. As of December 31, 2016, we owned or franchised a total of 4,613 Tim Hortons restaurants. Of these restaurants, 4,584 were franchised (approximately 100%) and 29 were restaurants owned by us (Company restaurants). 
 Tim Hortons restaurants are quick service restaurants with a menu that includes premium blend coffee, tea, espresso-based hot and cold specialty drinks, fresh baked goods, including donuts, Timbits®, bagels, muffins, cookies and pastries, grilled paninis, classic sandwiches, wraps, soups and more. 
 Our Tim Hortons (TH) business generates revenue from four sources: (i) sales exclusive to Tim Hortons franchisees related to our supply chain operations, including manufacturing, procurement, warehousing and distribution, as well as sales to retailers; (ii) franchise revenues, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchise restaurants and franchise fees paid by franchisees; (iii) property revenues from properties we lease or sublease to franchisees; and (iv) sales at Company restaurants. 
 Our Burger King Brand 
 Founded in 1954, Burger King is the worlds second largest fast food hamburger restaurant (FFHR) chain as measured by total number of restaurants. As of December 31, 2016, we owned or franchised a total of 15,738 Burger King restaurants in more than 100 countries and U.S. territories. Of these restaurants, 15,667 were franchised (approximately 100%) and 71 were company-owned. 
 Burger King restaurants are quick service restaurants that feature flame-grilled hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, soft drinks and other affordably-priced food items. Burger King restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers, with multiple dayparts and product platforms appealing to different customer groups. With over 60 years of operating history, Burger King has developed a scalable and cost-efficient QSR hamburger restaurant model that offers guests fast and delicious food. 
 Our Burger King (BK) business generates revenue from three sources: (i) franchise revenues, consisting primarily of royalties based on a percentage of sales reported by franchise restaurants and franchise fees paid by franchisees; (ii) property revenues from properties we lease or sublease to franchisees; and (iii) sales at Company restaurants. 
 Our Industry 
 Both of our brands operate in the QSR segment of the restaurant industry. In the United States and Canada, the QSR segment is the largest segment of the restaurant industry and has demonstrated growth over a long period of time. According to The NPD Group, Inc. (NPD Group), which prepares and disseminates CREST® data, QSR consumer spending totaled approximately $282 billion in the United States and approximately C$26 billion in Canada for the 12-month period ended November 2016. 
 Our Tim Hortons brand operates in the donut/coffee/tea category of the QSR segment. According to NPD Group, the donut/coffee/tea category generated customer spending of approximately C$9.3 billion in Canada for the 12-month period ended November 2016, representing 36% of total QSR consumer spending. According to NPD Group, for the 12-month period ended November 2016, Tim Hortons accounted for 29% of the Canadian QSR segment and 82% of the donut/coffee/tea category of the Canadian QSR segment, in each case based on consumer spending.

Our Burger King brand operates in the FFHR category of the QSR segment. According to NPD Group, the FFHR category is the largest category in the QSR segment, generating consumer spending of $77 billion in the United States for the 12-month period ended November 2016, representing 17% of total QSR consumer spending. According to NPD Group, for the 12-month period ended November 2016, Burger King accounted for approximately 12% of total FFHR consumer spending in the United States. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 We believe that we have created a financially strong company built upon a foundation of two thriving, independent brands with significant global growth potential and the opportunity to be one of the most efficient franchised QSR operators in the world. 

 | Accelerate Global Restaurant Growth. We believe there is an attractive opportunity to grow the Tim Hortons and Burger King brands around the world by expanding our presence in existing markets and entering new markets where the brands are not present today.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enhance Guest Service and Experience at Our Restaurants. Guest satisfaction and providing a positive experience in our restaurants for our guests are integral to the success of our brands. We continue to focus on improving our level of service through comprehensive training, improved restaurant operations, reimaged restaurants and appealing menu options.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase Restaurant Sales and Profitability. Restaurant sales and profitability are critical to the success of our franchise partners and our ability to grow our brands around the world. We believe that a focus on relevant menu innovation, operational simplification and excellence, compelling marketing communications and investment in a modern image for our restaurant base will allow us to continue to grow the same store sales of our existing restaurants. We are also focused on growing franchisee profitability by leveraging our global scale and using data to benchmark performance and identify areas of focus.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Become the Most Efficient Franchised QSR Operator through a Constant Focus on Costs and Sharing Best Practices. We have achieved significant cost efficiencies at TH and BK through a cost management system, which requires departments to budget by estimating and justifying costs and expenditures from a zero base, rather than focusing on the prior years base. The brands continue to share and leverage best practices, and are supported by a global shared services platform and other non-brand dedicated functions such as finance, human resources, information technology, and legal.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Preserve Rich Heritages of Both Brands. Both Tim Hortons and Burger King continue to be managed as independent brands with separately managed franchisee relationships. TH has its brand headquarters in Oakville, Ontario and plays a prominent role in local communities through its work with certain charities such as the Tim Hortons Childrens Foundation and the Timbits Minor Sports Program. The Burger King brand was founded in Miami over 60 years ago, and BK maintains its brand headquarters in Miami, Florida. BK is an active contributor to its local communities with a particular emphasis on education through the Burger King McLamore Foundation.

Our Global Restaurant Operations 
 Operating Segments 
 Our business consisted of two segments at December 31, 2016. Our TH business is managed in one segment and our BK business is managed in the other segment. Additional financial information about segments can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 Of the total number of Tim Hortons restaurants as of December 31, 2016, 82.4% were located in Canada, 14.8% in the U.S. and 2.8% in the Middle East. In the U.S., Tim Hortons restaurants are located in 16 states, concentrated in the Northeast in New York, and in the Midwest in Michigan and Ohio. 
 Of the total number of Burger King restaurants as of December 31, 2016, 45.5% were located in the U.S. and 54.5% were located in markets outside of the U.S. 
 
5 
 
As part of our development approach for both TH and BK in the U.S., we have granted limited development rights in specific areas to franchisees in connection with area representative and area development agreements. We expect to enter into similar arrangements in the U.S. in 2017 and beyond. In Canada, we have not granted exclusive or protected areas to any Tim Hortons franchisees, with limited exceptions. 
 As part of our international growth strategy for Burger King, we have created strategic master franchise joint ventures in a number of markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific (APAC) and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and received a meaningful minority equity stake in each joint venture. We have also entered into master franchise and development agreements in a number of markets across EMEA, APAC and LAC. In 2016, we established master franchise joint ventures for Tim Hortons in Great Britain and the Philippines. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate international development of Tim Hortons and Burger King, including through the establishment of master franchises with exclusive development rights and joint ventures with new and existing franchisees. 
 Advertising and Promotions 
 In general, franchisees fund substantially all of the marketing programs for our Tim Hortons and Burger King brands by making contributions ranging from 3.5% to 5.0% of gross sales to advertising funds that we manage. Advertising contributions are used to pay for expenses relating to marketing, advertising and promotion, including market research, production, advertising costs, sales promotions and other support functions for the respective brands. 
 We manage the advertising funds for both of our brands in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in certain other markets where Burger King has historically operated Company restaurants. However, in many of BKs international markets, including the markets managed by master franchisees, franchisees make contributions into franchisee-managed advertising funds. As part of our global marketing strategy, we provide Burger King franchisees with advertising support and guidance in order to deliver a consistent global brand message. 
 Product Development 
 New product development is a key driver of the long-term success for both of our brands. We believe the development of new products can drive traffic by expanding our customer base, allowing restaurants to expand into new dayparts, and continuing to build brand leadership in food quality and taste. Based on what our guests tell us globally, we drive product innovation in order to satisfy the needs of our guests around the world in the best way. This strategy will continue to be a focus for both brands in 2017 and beyond. 
Operations Support 
 Our operations strategy is designed to deliver best-in-class restaurant operations by Tim Hortons and Burger King franchisees and to improve friendliness, cleanliness, speed of service and overall guest satisfaction. Both of our brands have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to product quality, cleanliness and maintenance of the premises. In addition, Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with quality assurance and health standards which each brand has established, as well as standards set by applicable governmental laws and regulations. Each franchisee typically participates in initial and ongoing training programs to learn all aspects of operating a Tim Hortons or Burger King restaurant in accordance with each brands operating standards. 
Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution 
 In general, we approve the manufacturers of the food, packaging and equipment products and other products used in our Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants. We have a comprehensive supplier approval process, which requires all products to pass our quality standards and the suppliers manufacturing process and facilities to pass on-site food safety inspections. Our franchisees are required to purchase substantially all food and other products from approved suppliers and distributors. 
 Tim Hortons products are sourced from a combination of third-party suppliers and our own manufacturing facilities. We operate two wholly-owned coffee roasting facilities in Hamilton, Ontario and Rochester, New York, where we blend all of the coffee for our Tim Hortons restaurants to protect the proprietary blend of our premium restaurant coffee and, where practical, for our take home, packaged coffee. Our fondant and fills manufacturing facility in Oakville, Ontario, produces, and is the primary supplier of, the ready-to-use glaze, fondants and fills which are used in connection with a number of Tim Hortons products. As of December 31, 2016, we have only one or a few suppliers to service each category of products sold at our system restaurants, and the loss of any one of these suppliers would likely adversely affect our business. 
 
6 
 
We sell most other raw materials and supplies, including coffee, sugar, paper goods and other restaurant supplies, to Tim Hortons restaurants. We purchase those raw materials from multiple suppliers and generally have alternative sources of supply for each. While we have multiple suppliers for coffee from various coffee-producing regions, the available supply and price for high-quality coffee beans can fluctuate dramatically. Accordingly, we monitor world market conditions for green (unroasted) coffee and contract for future supply volumes to obtain expected requirements of high-quality coffee beans at acceptable prices. 
 Our TH business has significant supply chain operations, including procurement, warehousing and distribution, to supply paper and dry goods to a substantial majority of our Canadian restaurants, and procure and supply frozen baked goods and some refrigerated products to most of our Ontario and Quebec restaurants. We act as a distributor to Tim Hortons restaurants in Canada through five distribution centers located in Canada. We own or lease a significant number of trucks and trailers that regularly deliver to most of our Canadian restaurants. In the U.S., we supply similar products to system restaurants through third-party distributors. 
 All of the products used in our Burger King restaurants are sourced from third-party suppliers. Restaurant Services, Inc. (RSI) is the purchasing agent for the Burger King system in the United States and negotiates the purchase terms for most equipment, food, beverages (other than branded soft drinks) and other products used in Burger King restaurants. RSI is also authorized to purchase and manage distribution services on behalf of most of the Burger King restaurants in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, four distributors serviced approximately 88.6% of U.S. system restaurants and the loss of any one of these distributors would likely adversely affect our business. 
 In 2000, Burger King Corporation entered into long-term exclusive contracts with The Coca-Cola Company and Dr Pepper/Snapple, Inc. to supply Burger King restaurants with their products and which obligate restaurants in the United States to purchase a specified number of gallons of soft drink syrup. These volume commitments are not subject to any time limit. As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that it will take approximately 14 years to complete the Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper/Snapple, Inc. purchase commitments. If these agreements were terminated, we would be obligated to pay an aggregate amount equal to approximately $480 million as of December 31, 2016 based on an amount per gallon for each gallon of soft drink syrup remaining in the purchase commitments, interest and certain other costs. 
 Franchise Agreements and Other Arrangements 
 General. We grant franchises to operate restaurants using Tim Hortons and Burger King trademarks, trade dress and other intellectual property, uniform operating procedures, consistent quality of products and services and standard procedures for inventory control and management. For each franchise restaurant, we generally enter into a franchise agreement covering a standard set of terms and conditions. Recurring fees consist of periodic royalty and advertising payments. Franchisees report gross sales on a monthly or weekly basis and pay royalties based on gross sales. 
 Franchise agreements are generally not assignable without our consent. Our Tim Hortons franchise agreements grant us the right to reacquire a restaurant under certain circumstances, and our Burger King franchise agreements generally have a right of first refusal if a franchisee proposes to sell a restaurant. Defaults (including non-payment of royalties or advertising contributions, or failure to operate in compliance with our standards) can lead to termination of the franchise agreement.
 U.S. and Canada. Tim Hortons franchisees in the U.S. and Canada operate under several types of license agreements, with a typical term for a standard restaurant of 10 years plus renewal period(s) of approximately 10 years in the aggregate. Tim Hortons franchisees who lease land and/or buildings from us typically pay a royalty of 3.0% to 4.5% of weekly restaurant gross sales. Our license agreements contemplate a one-time franchise fee which must be paid in full before the restaurant opens for business and upon renewal. Under a separate lease or sublease, Tim Hortons franchisees typically pay monthly rent based on a fixed monthly payment and may provide for contingent rental payments based on a percentage (usually 7.0% to 10.0%) of monthly gross sales or flow through monthly rent based on the terms of an underlying lease. Where the franchisee owns the premises, leases it from a third party or enters into a flow through lease with Tim Hortons, the royalty is typically increased. In addition, the royalty rates under license agreements entered into in connection with non-standard restaurants, including self-serve kiosks and strategic alliances with third parties, may vary from those described above and are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. 
 For some existing Tim Hortons franchisees in the U.S. and Canada, we have entered into operator agreements, in which the operator acquires the right to operate a Tim Hortons restaurant, but we continue to be the owner of the equipment, signage and trade fixtures. Such arrangements usually require the operator to pay approximately 20% of the restaurants weekly gross sales to us. These operators also make the required contributions to our advertising funds, described above. In any such arrangement, we and the operator each have the option to terminate the agreement upon 30 days notice.

The typical Burger King franchise agreement in the U.S. and Canada has a 20-year term (for both initial grants and renewals of franchises) and contemplates a one-time franchise fee which must be paid in full before the restaurant opens for business, or in the case of renewal, before expiration of the current franchise term. Subject to the incentive programs described below, most new Burger King franchise restaurants pay a royalty of 4.5% in the United States and Canada. 
 In an effort to improve the image of our restaurants in the United States, we offered Burger King franchisees in the U.S. reduced up-front franchise fees and limited-term royalty and advertising fund rate reductions to remodel restaurants to our modern image during 2015 and 2016 and we plan to continue to offer remodel incentives to U.S. franchisees during 2017. These limited-term incentive programs are expected to negatively impact our effective royalty rate until 2024. However, we expect this impact to be partially mitigated as we will also be entering into new franchise agreements for Burger King restaurants in the United States with a 4.5% royalty rate. 
 International. Historically, we entered into franchise agreements for each Burger King restaurant in our international markets with up-front franchise fees and monthly royalties and advertising contributions each of up to 5.0% of gross sales. However, as part of the international growth strategy for both of our brands, we have entered into master franchise agreements or development agreements that grant franchisees exclusive development rights and, in some cases, require them to provide support services to other franchisees in their markets. In 2016, we entered into master franchise agreements for the Tim Hortons brand in Great Britain and the Philippines, and for the Burger King brand in Belgium. The up-front franchise fees and royalty rate paid by master franchisees vary from country to country, depending on the facts and circumstances of each market. 
 Franchise Restaurant Leases. We leased or subleased 3,497 properties to Tim Hortons franchisees and 1,727 properties to Burger King franchisees as of December 31, 2016 pursuant to separate lease agreements with these franchisees. For properties that we lease from third-party landlords and sublease to franchisees, our leases generally provide for fixed rental payments and may provide for contingent rental payments based on a restaurants annual gross sales. Franchisees who lease land only or land and building from us do so on a triple net basis. Under these triple net leases, the franchisee is obligated to pay all costs and expenses, including all real property taxes and assessments, repairs and maintenance and insurance. 
Intellectual Property 
 We own valuable intellectual property relating to our Tim Hortons and Burger King brands, including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information, some of which are of material importance to our TH and BK businesses. We have established the standards and specifications for most of the goods and services used in the development, improvement and operation of our Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants. These proprietary standards, specifications and restaurant operating procedures are our trade secrets. Additionally, we own certain patents of varying duration relating to equipment used in Burger King restaurants. 
Competition 
 Tim Hortons and Burger King compete in the U.S., Canada and internationally with many well-established food service companies on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. Our competitors include a variety of independent local operators, in addition to well-capitalized regional, national and international restaurant chains and franchises. We also compete for consumer dining dollars with national, regional and local (i) quick service restaurants that offer alternative menus, (ii) casual and fast casual restaurant chains and (iii) convenience stores and grocery stores. Tim Hortons principal competitors include McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks, and Burger Kings principal competitors include McDonalds and Wendys. 
 The restaurant industry has few barriers to entry, and therefore new competitors may emerge at any time.

Government Regulations and Affairs 
 General. We and our franchisees are subject to various laws and regulations including (i) licensing and regulation relating to health, food preparation, sanitation and safety standards and, for our distribution business, traffic and transportation regulations; (ii) information security, privacy and consumer protection laws; and (iii) other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act and similar Canadian federal and provincial legislation that can have a significant impact on our franchisees and our performance. These regulations include food safety regulations, including supervision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its international equivalents, which govern the manufacture, labeling, packaging and safety of food. In addition, we are or may become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat, high-calorie and high-sodium foods, particularly in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain. Certain counties, states and municipalities have approved menu labeling legislation that requires restaurant chains to provide caloric information on menu boards, and menu labeling legislation has also been adopted on the U.S. federal level as well as in Ontario. 
 U.S. and Canada. Each Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurant must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. We and our franchisees are also subject to various employment laws, including laws governing union organizing, working conditions, work authorization requirements, health insurance, overtime and wages. In addition, we and our U.S. franchisees are subject to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
 We are subject to federal franchising laws adopted by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state and provincial franchising laws. Much of the legislation and rules adopted have been aimed at providing detailed disclosure to a prospective franchisee, duties of good faith as between the franchisor and the franchisee, and/or periodic registration by the franchisor with applicable regulatory agencies. Additionally, some U.S. states have enacted or are considering enacting legislation that governs the termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement and other aspects of the franchise relationship. 
 International. Internationally, we and our franchisees are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting them and their franchisees in the U.S. and Canada. We and our franchisees are also subject to a variety of tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment. 
Environmental Matters 
 Various laws concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and restaurant waste and the operation of restaurants in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our operations and the operations of our franchisees; however, compliance with applicable environmental regulations is not believed to have a material effect on capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, or our competitive position. Increased focus by U.S. and overseas governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives, particularly in the area of climate change. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. There is a possibility that government initiatives, or actual or perceived effect of changes in weather patterns, climate or water resources could have a direct impact on the operations of our brands in ways that we cannot predict at this time. 
Seasonal Operations 
 Our TH and BK businesses are moderately seasonal. Our Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurant sales are typically higher in the spring and summer months when the weather is warmer than in the fall and winter months. Our restaurant sales are typically lowest during the winter months, which include February, the shortest month of the year. Furthermore, adverse weather conditions can have material adverse effects on restaurant sales. The timing of holidays may also impact restaurant sales. Because our businesses are moderately seasonal, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or for the full fiscal year. 
Our Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,300 employees in our restaurant support centers, regional offices, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, field operations and Company restaurants. Our franchisees are independent business owners so their employees are not our employees and therefore are not included in our employee count.
