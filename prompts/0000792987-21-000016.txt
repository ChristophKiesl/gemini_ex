ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
Astec Industries, Inc. is a Tennessee corporation which was incorporated in 1972. We design, engineer, manufacture and market equipment and components used primarily in road building and related construction activities, as well as other products discussed below. Our products are used in each phase of road building, from quarrying and crushing the aggregate to application of the road surface for both asphalt and concrete. We also manufacture certain equipment and components unrelated to road construction, including equipment for the mining, quarrying, construction and demolition industries and port and rail yard operators; industrial heat transfer equipment; commercial whole-tree pulpwood chippers; horizontal grinders; blower trucks; commercial and industrial burners; and combustion control systems. 
Our products are marketed both domestically and internationally primarily to asphalt producers; highway and heavy equipment contractors; utility contractors; sand and gravel producers; construction, demolition, recycle and crushing contractors; mine and quarry operators; port and inland terminal authorities; power stations and domestic and foreign government agencies. In addition to equipment sales, we manufacture and sell replacement parts for equipment in each of our product lines and replacement parts for some competitors' equipment. The distribution and sale of replacement parts is an integral part of our business.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to national and global economies. Our U.S. based businesses are designated as essential businesses for critical infrastructure companies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and, as such, have remained open throughout the pandemic. Two of our foreign operations in the Materials Solutions segment, located in Northern Ireland and South Africa, as dictated by their local governments, temporarily ceased manufacturing activities in late March 2020. The South Africa site reopened on May 4, 2020, and the Northern Ireland facility reopened on May 11, 2020. Our top priority is to protect our employees and their families, our customers and suppliers and our operations from any adverse impacts by taking precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and local governments. In early March 2020, we formed a COVID-19 task force, which continually monitors information from government agencies, our sites, customers, suppliers and other sources. We have enacted several policies to combat the spread of the virus and keep our employees and visitors safe, including work at home initiatives, limits on employee travel, visitor policies, cleaning and disinfecting procedures and mandated temperature checks for visitors and employees. We are utilizing technology to hold meetings virtually as business permits. 
During 2020, our sales and profits were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it may continue to negatively disrupt our business and results of operations in the future. The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the markets we serve remains highly uncertain and will depend largely on future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including infection rates increasing or returning in various geographic areas, the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as re-imposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions, and the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine, among other things. These developments are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately predicted. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Corporate Strategic Objectives
Beginning in late 2019, we initiated a strategic transformation focused on implementing new business strategies and a new operating structure. This transformation was focused on aligning our operations under the OneASTEC business model with the strategic pillars of Simplify, Focus and Grow. 
Simplify
As part of our strategic transformation, we have focused on optimizing our organizational structure and operations to execute our profitable growth strategy. 
•Centralizing our organization into sites with common platforms and operating models supports organic sales growth as it is easier for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders to understand and interact with us.
•We are focused on productivity gains and cost reductions across our business through reducing complexity in our organization structure and plan to continue to leverage our global footprint consolidation actions to drive greater efficiencies across our operations while maintaining strong customer relationships. 
•Efforts are directed toward product simplification through the development of a rationalized global product portfolio executed through manufacturing centers of excellence. 
•We strive to optimize the supply chain through leveraging the size and scale of our global operations to improve lead times, lower logistics costs and introduce localized product support. 
As part of these initiatives, we consolidated four sites in 2019 and 2020 and recently announced the consolidation of our Tacoma site. A further discussion of these site consolidations is included in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Table of Contents

Focus
We believe enhanced efficiencies across the Astec organization will result from utilizing our OneASTEC business model to concentrate resources on excellence initiatives.
•We are focused on driving commercial excellence and providing a holistic set of solutions to strengthen our relationships with customers and maintain our market leadership positions.
•We intend to streamline our operational excellence processes through the implementation of lean principles in our operations and incorporate production systems that embed continuous improvement into the culture of our manufacturing processes.
•With aligned key performance indicators and incentives, we intend to enhance accountability across the business and drive a performance-based culture.
Grow
We are focused on growing sales and profits organically as well as selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships within the "Rock to Road" value chain. 
•Organic growth will be focused on reinvigorating innovation with a new product development approach that increases our vitality index over time. 
•Through controls and automation as well as other technologies, we expect to leverage technology and digital connectivity to enhance the customer experience. 
•We seek to identify, analyze and assess potential targets for strategic acquisitions and partnerships globally to establish a presence in attractive new markets, supplement our current product offerings or accelerate technologies or other enhancements that can be leveraged in our existing product portfolio.
As part of our growth initiatives, we completed three acquisitions in 2020. A further discussion of these acquisitions is included in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Business Segments
The Company consists of a total of 33 companies that are included in our consolidated financial statements, of which 25 represent our manufacturing sites and sites that operate as sales offices for our manufacturing locations. During the first quarter of 2020, we completed an internal reorganization from a decentralized management structure to a matrix organizational management structure with major directives and decisions being made at the segment and/or parent company level and, as a result, realigned our reportable segments moving from three to two reportable segments (plus Corporate) - Infrastructure Solutions and Materials Solutions. Our two reportable business segments comprise sites based upon the nature of the products or services produced, the type of customer for the products, the similarity of economic characteristics, the manner in which management reviews results and the nature of the production process, among other considerations. 
The Corporate category consists primarily of our parent company and Astec Insurance Company ("Astec Insurance"), a captive insurance company, which do not meet the requirements for separate disclosure as an operating segment or inclusion in one of the other reporting segments. We evaluate performance and allocate resources to our operating segments based on profit or loss from operations before United States ("U.S.") federal income taxes, state deferred taxes and corporate overhead and, thus, these costs are included in the Corporate category.
Amounts previously reported under the previous segment structure have been restated to conform to the new segment structure. Additionally, in both internal and external communications, we are transitioning references to each individual site by a name associated with its location, as compared to previous references to the individual subsidiary company name.

Infrastructure Solutions Segment
Overview
The Infrastructure Solutions segment designs, engineers, manufactures and markets a complete line of asphalt plants, concrete plants and their related components and ancillary equipment as well as supplying other heavy equipment. 
The Infrastructure Solutions segment was operated from the following sites in 2020:


Site | Location | Site | Location 
Albuquerque (1) | New Mexico, United States | Enid (3) | Oklahoma, United States 
AMM (2) | Hameln, Germany | EUG-Airport Rd | Oregon, United States 
Australia | Brisbane, Australia | LatAm | Santiago, Chile 
Blair | Nebraska, United States | Parsons | Kansas, United States 
Burlington | Wisconsin, United States | St. Bruno | Quebec, Canada 
CHA-Jerome Ave | Tennessee, United States | Tacoma (4) | Washington, United States
CHA-Manufacturers Rd | Tennessee, United States | Thailand | Bangkok, Thailand 
CHA-Wilson Rd | Tennessee, United States | | 

(1) The Albuquerque site was closed as of March 31, 2020 and its land and building were sold in the third quarter of 2020. Manufacturing and marketing of Albuquerque product lines were transferred to other facilities within the Infrastructure Solutions segment in late 2019 and early 2020.
(2) Operations of AMM ceased in 2019 and its land and building were sold in January 2020.
(3) In late 2019, the oil and gas drilling product lines located at the Enid facility were impaired and discontinued. These remaining assets were sold in the third quarter of 2020. In October 2020, we sold the assets related to Enid's remaining water well line of business.
(4) In January 2021, management announced plans to close the Tacoma facility. Manufacturing and marketing of Tacoma product lines are expected to be transferred to other facilities within the Infrastructure Solutions segment in mid-2021.
The U.S. based sites within the Infrastructure Solutions segment are primarily manufacturing operations while those located internationally generally market, service and install equipment and provide parts in the regions in which they operate for many of the products produced by all of our manufacturing sites. Our Thailand site is in the start-up phase of new sales operations. 
Products and Services
The primary products produced by the Infrastructure Solutions segment include:

Asphalt plants and related components | Heaters | Concrete dust control systems 
Asphalt pavers | Vaporizers | Concrete material handling systems 
Screeds | Heat recovery units | Paste back-fill plants 
Asphalt storage tanks | Hot oil heaters | Bagging plants 
Fuel storage tanks | Industrial and asphalt burners and systems | Custom batch plants 
Material transfer vehicles | Soil stabilizing-reclaiming machinery | Blower trucks and trailers 
Milling machines | Soil remediation plants | Wood chippers and grinders 
Pump trailers | Concrete batch plants | Control systems 
Liquid terminals | Storage equipment and related parts | Service, construction and retrofits 
Polymer plants | Concrete mixers | Engineering and environmental permitting services

A typical asphalt mixing plant consists of heating and storage equipment for liquid asphalt; cold feed bins for blending aggregates; a counter-flow continuous type unit (Astec Double Barrel) for drying, heating and mixing; a baghouse composed of air filters and other pollution control devices; hot storage bins or silos for temporary storage of hot-mix asphalt; and a control house. We introduced the concept of high plant portability for asphalt plants in 1979. Our current generation of portable asphalt plants is marketed as the Six Pack and consists of six or more portable components designed to be easily transported from one construction site to another, thereby reducing relocation expenses and interruption of operations. High plant portability is an industry innovation developed and successfully marketed by us.
The components in our asphalt mixing plants are fully automated and use both microprocessor-based and programmable logic control systems for efficient operation. The plants are manufactured to meet or exceed federal and state clean air standards. We also build batch type asphalt plants and have developed specialized asphalt recycling equipment for use with our hot-mix asphalt plants.
In addition, we developed the patented water injection warm mix asphalt system, which allows the asphalt mix to be prepared and placed at lower temperatures than conventional systems and operates with a substantial reduction in emissions during paving and load-out. Previous technologies for warm mix production rely on expensive additives, procedures and/or special asphalt cement delivery systems that significantly increase the cost per ton of mix. Our multi-nozzle device eliminates the need for the expensive additives by mixing a small 
Table of Contents

amount of water and asphalt cement together to create microscopic bubbles that reduce the viscosity of the liquid asphalt coating on the rock, thereby allowing the mix to be handled and worked at lower temperatures.
We are focused on producing equipment with the most advanced mix recycling technology in the industry. More tons of recyclable asphalt pavement ("RAP") are available than are currently being utilized due to restrictions in the amount of RAP allowed by various governmental agencies. Our recycle technology is continuously being enhanced and is providing the science to alleviate the concerns driving such restrictions and to improve RAP utilization percentages in the asphalt industry. Our latest system improvement, the RAP Pre-Dryer System, was successfully field prototyped in 2018 and is now available to the industry. It has produced mixes of up to 80% RAP and can consistently produce mixes with 70% RAP. We have also enhanced our Double Barrel equipment line by providing a system with increased drum length and an external mixer that provides the capability to use up to 65% RAP without pre-drying.
Many of our highly technical, sophisticated large asphalt plants, while ideally suited for the United States domestic market, are not as well suited in many international markets. In 2019, we completed testing of our new Voyager 140 portable asphalt plant designed specifically for the international market. The Voyager 140’s design is based upon our proven Double Barrel drum mixer and has production capacity of 140 tons per hour and RAP mixing capabilities of 50%. The Voyager 140 also provides full-size plant features in a compact highly-portable configuration. In addition, we are currently developing our new Ventura 140SL portable asphalt plant, which is also focused on satisfying needs of the international market, and introduces a smaller, more mobile plant design with single-load capability.
Our pavers have been designed to minimize maintenance costs while exceeding road surface smoothness requirements. Generally, our equipment can be used in tandem with each other or separately with equipment already owned by the customer. Our mobile, self-propelled material transfer vehicle ("Shuttle Buggy") allows continuous paving by separating truck unloading from the paving process while remixing the asphalt. A typical asphalt paver must stop paving to permit truck unloading of asphalt mix. By permitting continuous paving, the Shuttle Buggy allows the asphalt paver to produce a smoother road surface while reducing the time required to pave the road surface and the number of haul trucks required. As a result of the pavement smoothness achieved with this machine, certain states now require the use of the Shuttle Buggy. Studies using infrared technology have revealed problems caused by differential cooling of the hot-mix during hauling, but the Shuttle Buggy remixes the material to a uniform temperature and gradation, thus eliminating these problems. The Shuttle Buggy includes the Guardian System that is designed to anticipate equipment maintenance needs resulting in more uptime reliability while also providing production and performance data as well as real-time location information to the owner. The new SB3000 model introduced to the market in 2020, incorporates features and technology to improve the user experience in terms of improved visibility, ground level operation, as well as improved material handling and vehicle transportability. Our Spray Paver model, which is recommended for use with the Shuttle Buggy, is also designed to carry and spray tack coat directly in front of the hot mix asphalt in a single process, thus eliminating the need for a separate tack truck.
Milling machines remove old asphalt from the road surface before new asphalt mix is applied. Our product line of milling machines, which are designed for larger jobs, are manufactured with a simplified control system, wide conveyors, direct drives and a wide range of horsepower and cutting capabilities to provide versatility in product application. In addition to the half-lane and larger highway class milling machines, we also manufacture a smaller, utility class machine for two-to-four foot cutting widths and a utility class cold planer model mounted on steel wheels.
Soil stabilizers are produced in multiple configurations and double as asphalt reclaiming machines for road rehabilitations, in addition to their primary purpose of stabilizing soil sub-grades with additives to provide an improved base on which to pave.
Our patented screeds use a hydraulic powered generator to electrify elements that heat a screed plate so asphalt will not stick to it while paving, attach to asphalt paving machines and place asphalt on the roadbed at a desired thickness and width while smoothing and compacting the surface. Our screeds can be configured to fit many types of asphalt paving machines, including machines manufactured by us as well as our competitors.
Equipment for the production of concrete is produced primarily at three facilities: Blair, Burlington and St. Bruno. Together, these three locations produce a market leading product portfolio with many synergistic opportunities to create value for our customers. The Blair and St. Bruno sites were acquired in 2020 and joined the Burlington location to expand our product line and offering for the concrete production industry. The series of concrete batch plants, including the LO-PRO, the ALL-PRO, the Model S, the portable Mobile 12 and the modular LoGo, are key products.
We also produce industry leading combustion products for a variety of industrial applications as new applications have grown rapidly. At the present time, our products, most of which are customized for a particular application, are used in a score of different industries and purposes including chemical plants, at oil-and-gas refineries, on off-shore platforms, on barges, at power generation plants, wood product manufacturers, food processors, textile factories, pharmaceutical producers and roofing manufacturers.
We engineer and develop new products dedicated to improving customers' productivity and profitability. Our products share environmentally conscious designs and are crafted from quality materials by an expert staff of dedicated professionals.

(1) The Mequon facility ceased production operations in August 2020 with the manufacturing and marketing for the Mequon product lines transferring to other facilities within the Materials Solutions segment in late 2020.
The sites within the Materials Solutions segment are primarily manufacturing operations with the AME and India sites functioning to market, service and install equipment and provide parts in the regions in which they operate for many of the products produced by all of our manufacturing sites. Belo Horizonte manufactures asphalt plants in addition to certain core products produced in the Materials Solutions segment. Belo Horizonte also markets products in the Brazilian market that are produced by all of our manufacturing sites. Our India site is in the start-up phase of new sales operations. 
Table of Contents

Belo Horizonte was a start-up in 2014 and delivered its first asphalt plant in early 2016; however, sales in the South American market have continued to be hampered by the economic downturn in South America and more specifically in Brazil. We plan to position ourselves to significantly increase the production and sales volumes by Belo Horizonte and have begun manufacturing other product lines at the facility. At December 31, 2020, we had an ownership interest of approximately 93% in Belo Horizonte.
Products and Services
The primary products produced and services provided by the Materials Solutions segment include:

Crushing equipment | Track-mounted systems | Bulk material handling solutions 
Vibrating equipment | Screening equipment | Electrical control centers 
Modular relocatable stationary plants | Conveying equipment | Plant automation products 
Mobile portable plants | Mineral processing equipment | Consulting and engineering services

In conjunction with the Materials Solutions products we manufacture, we offer consulting and engineering services to provide complete "turnkey" processing systems, which often include electrical control centers and plant automation products we produce. 
We are a world leader in the development of hydraulic relief jaw crushers having patented our first model in 2002. Hydraulic relief jaw crushers are a significant improvement in safety, adjustment and clearing of material in jaw crushers. In addition, we offer a range of cone crushers to meet critical aggregate or mining needs, which include technology features that deliver a distinct performance advantage, such as hydraulic overload protection, chamber clearing, push button adjustment and a proprietary anti-spin system.
Our vibrating screen line features multiple sizes of single deck to quadruple deck screens and contains the "Neverwear" sealing system guaranteed to keep lubricants in and to never wear out. 
We manufacture a complete line of primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary crushers, including jaw, horizontal shaft impactor, vertical shaft impactor and cone rock crushers as well as industry related washing and conveying equipment, mobile screening plants, portable and stationary screen structures and vibrating and high frequency screens. These rock crushers are used by mining, quarrying and sand and gravel producers to crush oversized aggregate to salable size, in addition to their use for recycled concrete and asphalt. This equipment can be purchased as individual components, as portable plants for flexibility or as completely engineered systems for both portable, stationary and RAP applications. We offer the highly-portable Fast Pack System, featuring quick setup and teardown, thereby maximizing production time and minimizing downtime. We also offer portable fully self-contained and self-propelled Fast Trax track-mounted jaw, cone, VSI and horizontal shaft crushers, which are ideal for either recycle or hard rock applications, allowing the producer to move the equipment to the material. The expanded GT line of track-mounted crushing and screening plants focuses more specifically on the need for rental and global markets.
Portable plants combine various combinations of crushing, screening and conveying equipment mounted on tow away chassis and track chassis configurations. Due to high transportation costs of construction materials, many producers use portable equipment to process materials they need in close proximity to their job sites. Portable plants allow aggregate producers the ability to quickly and efficiently move equipment from one location to another as their jobs necessitate. The portable track plants are fully self-contained and allow operators to be producing materials within minutes of unloading equipment off of their transport trucks. Track-mounted crushing and screening plants enable contractors to perform jobs that in the past were not economically feasible and also allow our dealers to compete in the large track-mounted rental market.
Sand classifying and washing equipment is designed to clean, separate and re-blend material from sand deposits to meet the size specifications for critical applications. Products offered include fine and coarse material washers, log washers, blade mills, sand classifying tanks, cyclones, dewatering screens, density classifiers, sieve bend screens and attrition cells. Additional portable and stationary plants are also offered to handle the growing needs in construction sands, specialty sands and fines recovery. Screening plants are available in both stationary and highly portable models and are complemented by a full line of radial stacking and overland belt conveyors. Screening plants also serve the recycle, crushed stone, industrial and general construction industries.
Conveying equipment is designed to move or store aggregate and other bulk materials in radial cone-shaped or windrow stockpiles. Our SuperStacker telescoping conveyor and Wizard Touch automated controls are designed to add efficiency and accuracy to whatever the stockpile specifications require. Additionally, high capacity rail and barge loading/unloading material handling systems are an important part of their product lines.
Our complete line of industry leading rock breaker systems for the mining, quarry and recycling markets provide large-scale stationary rock breakers for open pit mining, as well as mid-sized stationary rock breakers for underground applications. In addition, we offer a full line of smaller rock breaker systems for mobile track and portable primary crushing plants as well as a full line of four-wheel drive articulated production and utility vehicles, scalers and rock breakers for underground mining and a complete line of hydraulic breakers, compactors and demolition attachments for the North American construction and demolition markets.
Our mobile bulk material handling solutions are designed to handle all free-flowing bulk materials, including but not limited to ores, coal, aggregates, fertilizers, grains, woodchips and pellets and are sold globally.

Backlog
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the backlog for the Materials Solutions Group was approximately $142.3 million and $74.1 million, respectively. Management expects the entire current backlog to be filled in 2021.
Corporate 
The Corporate category consists of our parent company and our captive insurance company, Astec Insurance, which do not meet the requirements for separate disclosure as an operating segment or inclusion in one of the other reporting segments. Our parent company and our captive insurance company provide support and corporate oversight for all the sites. We record U.S. federal income tax expenses and state deferred taxes for all business segments on the parent company's books; therefore, these taxes are included in the Corporate category for segment reporting.
Common to Both Reporting Segments
The following information applies to both the Infrastructure Solutions and the Materials Solutions reporting segments.
Manufacturing
We manufacture many of the component parts and related equipment for our products, while several large components of our products are purchased "ready-for-use", such items include engines, axles, tires and hydraulics. In many cases, we design, engineer and manufacture custom component parts and equipment to meet the particular needs of individual customers. Manufacturing operations during 2020 took place at 22 separate locations. Our manufacturing operations consist primarily of fabricating steel components and the assembly and testing of our products to ensure that we achieve quality standards.
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials and some manufactured components and replacement parts for our products from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. Raw materials used in the manufacture of our products include carbon steel, pipe and various types of alloy steel, which are normally purchased from distributors and other sources. Most steel is delivered on a "just-in-time" arrangement from the supplier to reduce inventory requirements at the manufacturing facilities, but is occasionally inventoried after purchase. Raw materials for manufacturing are normally readily available; however, certain highly customized components may require longer than normal lead times. Other components used in the manufacturing processes include engines, gearboxes, power transmissions and electronic systems. We purchase hydraulic breakers under a purchasing arrangement with a South Korean supplier. We believe the South Korean supplier has sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated demand; however, alternative suppliers exist for these components should any supply disruptions occur.
Table of Contents

Government Regulations
We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. The Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, other federal agencies and certain state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations. Many of these federal and state agencies may seek fines and penalties for violations of these laws and regulations. We have been able to operate under these laws and regulations without any material adverse effect on our business.
None of our reporting operations are within highly regulated industries. However, air pollution control equipment we manufacture, principally for hot-mix asphalt plants, must comply with certain performance standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act applicable to "new sources" or new plants. Management believes our products meet all material requirements of such regulations, applicable state pollution standards and environmental protection laws.
In addition, due to the size and weight of certain equipment we manufacture, we and our customers may encounter various state regulations on maximum weights transportable on highways. Also, some states have regulations governing the operation of asphalt mixing plants, and most states have regulations relating to the accuracy of weights and measures, which affect some of the control systems we manufacture.
Compliance with these government regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position within the market to date.
Patents and Trademarks
We seek to obtain patents to protect the novel features of our products and processes. Our subsidiaries hold 113 United States patents and 154 foreign patents. Our subsidiaries have 44 United States and 85 foreign patent applications pending.
We have 80 trademarks registered in the United States, including logos for Astec, Carlson Paving, Heatec, KPI-JCI, Peterson Pacific, Power Flame, Roadtec and Telsmith, and the names ASTEC, CARLSON, HEATEC, JCI, KOLBERG, PETERSON, POWER FLAME, ROADTEC and TELSMITH, as well as a number of other product names. We also have 120 trademarks registered in foreign jurisdictions, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Union, France, Germany, India, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mexico, New Zealand, Paraguay, Peru, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Uruguay and Vietnam. We have 9 United States and 31 foreign trademark registration applications pending.
Engineering and Product Development
We conduct research and development activities to develop new products and to enhance the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products. We believe that our engineering and research and development efforts are key drivers of our success in the marketplace and dedicate substantial resources to engineering and product development activities including establishing an Innovation Services team. Our Innovation Services team has experts in advanced fields, such as simulation and digital twin creation, who support our development initiatives. In addition, we are focused on innovation in our products to support the "Rock to Road" value chain. 
Seasonality and Backlog
Revenues for recent years, normalized for acquisitions and the closures of Enid and Mequon, have been strongest during the first, second and fourth quarters with the third quarter consistently generating weaker results. We expect future operations in the near term to be typical of this historical trend.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a backlog for delivery of products at certain dates in the future of approximately $360.5 million and $263.7 million, respectively. Approximately $86.2 million of the increase in backlog between periods relates to orders from domestic customers. Our contracts reflected in the backlog generally are not, by their terms, subject to termination. Our management believes we are in substantial compliance with all manufacturing and delivery timetables.
Competition
Each business segment operates in domestic markets that are highly competitive with respect to price, service and product quality. While specific competitors are named within each business segment discussion above, imports do not generally constitute significant competition for us in the United States, except for milling machines and track-mounted crushers. In international sales, however, we often compete with foreign manufacturers that may have a local presence in the market we are attempting to penetrate.
In addition, asphalt and concrete are generally considered competitive products as a surface choice for new roads and highways. A portion of the interstate highway system is surfaced in concrete, but over 90% of all surfaced roads in the U.S. are paved with asphalt. Although concrete is used for some new road surfaces, asphalt is used for most resurfacing. Our customers generally offer both asphalt and concrete surfacing options. Our investment in concrete batch plants in 2020 enables us to be a singular provider to our customers for both asphalt and concrete equipment.

Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 3,537 individuals, including 3,083 employees in the U.S. and Canada. We also retain consultants, independent contractors and temporary and part-time workers. As of December 31, 2020, the functional representation of our employees was as follows: 2,185 were engaged in manufacturing, 401 in engineering, including support staff, and 951 in selling, administrative and management functions.
Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately two percent of our U.S. direct employees. From time to time, our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for renegotiation. Approximately 79 of our active U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO-CLC on behalf of its local affiliate Local Union No. 11-508-03, with an expiration date of December 9, 2022. Unions also represent approximately 25% of our employees at our manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Compensation and Benefits
We provide robust compensation and benefits. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, can include annual bonuses, share-based compensation awards, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services.
Health and Safety
The well-being and safety of our employees is a paramount value for us and this is consistent with our core values. We manage safety at (and from) the highest levels, using the same tools we employ to measure and improve other aspects of business performance, such as continuous improvement, key performance indicators, scorecards and performance management. More particularly, we undertake the following actions:
•provide mandatory safety trainings each month at our production facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks;
•local management completes safety management courses and cascade these safety practices throughout the organization, including daily "safety huddles" for each work-shift;
•we use safety scorecards, standardized signage, and visual management throughout our facilities, in addition to traditional safety training; and
•regularly feature safety best practices in our employee newsletters and town halls. 
We aspire to reduce lost time and recordable injuries each year. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced a 15% reduction in our recordable injuries compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, including zero recordable injuries at eight of our sites. Our OSHA Incident Rate experienced a slight decline from 1.40 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.39 for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, partners, and the communities in which we operate, and which complied with government orders. This included having those employees who could, work from home and implementing additional safety measures for our production and other employees continuing critical on-site work. Closely following the recommendations of the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and local governments, we also took the following actions to ensure our employees were safe:
•adjusted work schedules to allow appropriate gaps between work-shifts enabling the proper amount of social distance between employees; 
•provided additional personal protective equipment to employees;
•limited employee travel and encouraged quarantine upon return;
•developed a special COVID-19 quarantine policy that mandated employees to take time off;
•increased hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures at all locations;
•implemented temperature-taking and screening protocols for outside guests as well as employees upon entering facilities; 
•launched a COVID-19 task force to increase communications and ensure our employees had access to up-to-date and accurate information; and
•started increasing the use of technology to hold meetings virtually where possible.

We manufacture products deemed essential to critical infrastructure industries, including health and safety, food and agriculture, and energy, and as a result, all of our production sites have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we have invested in creating physically safe work environments for our employees.
Talent Development, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products and customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions. 
We provide all employees a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal, at all stages in their careers. In addition, talent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Development plans are created and monitored for critical roles to ensure progress is made along the established timelines. 
One of our core values – Respect – reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business. We recognize that our best performance comes when our teams are diverse and inclusive, and accordingly, we have begun work on building diverse talent pools as part of our recruitment efforts. With the support of our Board of Directors, we continue to explore additional diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
