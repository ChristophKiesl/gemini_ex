 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Company Overview
 We are a technology‑based education company and offer online curriculum, software systems and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning for students primarily in kindergarten through 12th grade, or K‑12. We provide a continuum of technology‑based educational products and solutions to public school districts, public schools, virtual charter schools, private schools and consumers as we strive to transform a student’s learning experience into one that delivers individualized education. We are accredited by AdvancEd, a non‑profit international accreditation agency for schools, districts, education service agencies, postsecondary institutions, and corporations.
 As an innovator in K‑12 online education, we believe we have attained distinctive core competencies that allow us to meet the varied needs of our school customers and students. These core competencies include our ability to create engaging curriculum, train teachers in effective online instruction, provide turn‑key management services to online schools, customize online learning programs for school districts, develop innovative new offerings, and assist legislators and policy makers in understanding the many dynamics of virtual and blended learning that can complement and transform traditional schools. These factors enable us to provide products and services to three lines of business that share many common attributes, including curriculum, learning systems, management expertise, logistical systems and marketing. These lines of business are: Managed Public School Programs, which is comprised of virtual and blended public schools (as more fully described below), Institutional business (educational products and services sold to school districts, public schools and other educational institutions that we do not manage), and Private Pay Schools and Other (private schools, including international, for which we charge student tuition and direct consumer sales).

       We continue to make significant capital investments intended to improve student academic outcomes, including the: (i) ongoing development and enhancement of our current and next generation curriculum and software; (ii) implementation of a new learning management platform for our middle and high school students; (iii) strengthening the corporate and school infrastructure to improve scalability, increase data security, and protect student privacy; (iv) procurement and delivery of student computers; and (v) conversion of interactive instructional products to enable delivery through tablets and mobile devices.

     Managed Public School Programs
 Our Managed Public School Programs business includes both virtual and blended public schools where a district or independent charter board contracts with K12 for a full‑time program of educational products and services. The Managed Public School Programs are programs in which K12 provides substantially all of the administrative management (e.g., budget proposals, financial reporting and staff recruitment), information technology, academic support services, curriculum, learning systems and instructional services. In contrast, Non‑managed Public School Programs do not provide primary administrative functions. In fiscal year 2017, our Managed Public School Programs accounted for approximately 83% of our revenue.
     Virtual Public Schools.  In full‑time virtual public schools, students receive online lessons over the Internet, utilize offline learning materials that we supply, and receive instruction from state certified teachers. In addition to providing our courses, course materials and, in certain cases, student computers, we also offer these schools a variety of administrative management, technology and academic support services. The majority of our revenue is derived from long‑term service agreements with the governing authorities of these virtual public schools.
     Blended Public Schools.  Blended public schools combine online learning and face‑to‑face instruction in a physical learning center.
     For both virtual and blended Managed Public School Programs, the governing authority that exercises  ultimate control over the schools negotiates contractual terms with us for all aspects of the management of the schools, including the creation and implementation of the academic plan, monitoring academic achievement, teacher recruitment, supervision, and training, student enrollment and marketing, compensation recommendations for school personnel, implementation of student support services, financial and regulatory compliance support, procurement of curriculum, computers and other required services and equipment. The scope of services we provide may also vary in accordance with applicable state regulations and each governing authority’s policies. Funding is provided primarily by state governments. For the 2016-17 school year, we provided these turn key management services to Managed Public Schools Programs in 33 states and the District of Columbia, which consisted of 77 Managed Public School Programs.  In earlier years, we grew primarily by entering into fully-managed service agreements with schools that offered statewide programs in new states and reported that growth by citing the number of states having these programs and by enrollments. Our Managed Public School Programs now involve the opening of multiple schools within the same state, as well as closures that can occur with contract terminations, non-renewals or charter revocations. Accordingly, we believe a metric based on the number of schools served by our Managed Public School Programs rather than by the number of states will more accurately reflect the status of this business going forward. 
     Institutional
 We work closely as a partner with a growing number of school districts and individual schools, enabling them to offer their students an array of online education solutions, including full‑time virtual and blended programs, semester courses and supplemental educational products. Institutional business includes Non‑managed Public School Programs and Institutional software and services where K12 provides curriculum and technology, and the school has an option to contract for instruction or other software and services we provide; however, the Institutional business offerings do not include primary administrative oversight to these programs. In addition to curriculum, systems and programs, we provide teacher training, teaching services and other support services. Our Institutional business customers include public school districts, private schools, charter schools, early childhood learning centers and corporate partners. Additionally, we operate Middlebury Interactive Languages LLC (“MIL”), which was formerly a joint venture with Middlebury College to develop and market online foreign language courses (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10). On December 27, 2016, we consummated the acquisition of the remaining 40% noncontrolling interest for $9.1 million in cash. As part of that transaction, we retained the right to use the MIL name in its products through April 2028. In addition, we secured the right to use the MIL name in marketing materials through December 2019. For the 2016-17 school year, we served school districts or individual schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including those where the regulatory environment restricts or prohibits statewide online programs.     Private Pay Schools and Other
 We operate three online private schools: The K12 International Academy, the George Washington University Online High School and the Keystone School. We also have entered into agreements which enable us to distribute our 

 
  5

 
products and services to students from more than 100 countries. We pursue international opportunities where we believe there is significant demand for quality online education. Our principal customers are U.S. students, including those who reside in states where the online public school option is not available, as well as expatriate families with students who seek to continue their studies in English and foreign students who may seek admission into a U.S. college or university. Additionally, our curriculum is sold to end user customers who desire to educate their children outside of the traditional school system or to supplement their child’s traditional education.
 Our History
 We were founded in 2000 to utilize advances in technology to provide children with access to a high‑quality public school education regardless of their geographic location or socioeconomic background. Given the geographic flexibility of technology‑based education, we believed we could help address the growing concerns regarding the regionalized disparity in the quality of public school education, both in the United States and abroad. The convergence of these factors and rapid advances in Internet networks created the opportunity to make a significant impact by deploying online learning software and systems on a flexible, online platform.
 In September 2001, we introduced our kindergarten through 2nd grade offering in Pennsylvania and Colorado, serving approximately 900 students in the two states combined. We subsequently added new grades and new schools in additional states. We also launched blended public schools that combine face‑to‑face time in the classroom with online instruction and opened an online private school to reach students worldwide. In school year 2016-17, our customers for Managed Public School Programs consisted of 77 schools throughout the United States. We also serve schools in all 50 states through our Institutional business.
 Our Market
 The U.S. market for K‑12 education is large and online learning is gaining greater acceptance. For example:

· | According to the most recently available data from the 2015 Keeping Pace with K‑12 Digital Learning report (“Keeping Pace”), over 50 million students attend K‑12 public schools, and nearly five million students are enrolled in private schools. Five states mandate the completion of an online course prior to high school graduation. Full‑time virtual charter schools served an estimated 275,000 students who took approximately 3.3 million semester equivalent courses online. Fourteen states have enacted online course choice laws. K12 is a sponsor of Keeping Pace along with 14 other educational organizations, including iNACOL.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The 2015 Keeping Pace report further states that 47% of students in grades 9‑12 pursue online learning to access courses not offered at the school, and 43% choose to take courses online to be able to work at their own pace. In addition, 2.2 million K‑12 students participated in a formal online learning program.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Additionally, according to a 2016 report by the National Home Education Research Institute, there are approximately 2.3 million home‑educated students in the United States, which has grown at an estimated 2% to 8% per annum over the past few years. Many of these students took an online course and a small percentage enrolled in a full‑time online program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Many parents and educators are seeking alternatives to traditional classroom‑based education for a variety of reasons. Demand for these alternatives is evident in the expanding number of choices available to parents and students.

· | According to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, enrollment at public charter schools has nearly tripled over the past 10 years, and there were approximately 6,900 public charter schools operating nationwide during the 2016-2017 school year, with an estimated enrollment of approximately 3.1 million students.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The 2015 Keeping Pace report indicates that the acceptance of online learning initiatives, including not only virtual and blended public schools, but also online courses, credit recovery, remediation, testing and Internet‑based professional development, has continued to grow. Districts are also rapidly adopting online learning to expand course offerings, provide schedule flexibility, increase graduation rates and lower the cost of delivering education.

 Demand for Education Alternatives: The Market Opportunity and the K12 Solutions 
 As evidenced by the rapid evolution of education technology and varying educational options being offered to K‑12 students, no single learning model has been found that works equally well for every student. Children today utilize technology in all aspects of their lives, and we expect this reality to extend to their education. Our business has been built on the premise that every student, regardless of geographic location or socioeconomic background, is entitled to a high quality education that is individualized and adaptable based on the student’s unique needs. We also believe all students can benefit from more engaging technology-enriched educational content.
 We anticipate that full‑time online public schools will meet the needs of a small percentage of the overall K‑12 student population, but that segment will still represent a large and growing opportunity for us in absolute terms. Across our educational programs, students come from a broad range of social, economic and academic backgrounds, and parents share the desire for individualized instruction to maximize their children’s potential. Examples of students for whom this solution may fit include, but are not limited to, families with: (i) students seeking to learn in a way that better accommodates their individual needs; (ii)  safety, social and health concerns about their local school, including students who are being bullied or are subjected to discrimination; (iii) students with disabilities who are seeking alternatives to traditional classrooms; (iv) students for whom the local public school is not meeting their needs; (v) students who seek or need greater flexibility than other alternatives, such as student‑athletes and performers who are not able to attend regularly‑scheduled classes; (vi) college‑bound students who want to bolster their college readiness and application appeal by taking additional Advanced Placement (“AP”), honors and/or elective courses; (vii) students seeking career and technical skills; (viii) high school dropouts who have decided to re‑enroll in school to earn a diploma; and (ix) students of military families who desire high quality, consistent education as they relocate to new locations. Our individualized learning approach allows students to optimize their educational experience and, therefore, their chances of achieving their goals.
 For the foreseeable future, most students in the United States will continue to be educated in traditional school buildings and classrooms. However, we believe that certain student segments will benefit from the availability of a choice for an online public education (including blended learning models), and that states and districts will seek to incorporate online and blended solutions into their school‑based programs.  Our Managed Public School Programs offer a full service, integrated program, and a complete solution for districts and schools that desire a turn‑key option. For public school customers who need less than a full service offering, our Institutional business provides online curriculum and services on a solutions‑oriented, customized basis. We believe these choices create the opportunity for us to serve the majority of students who will learn within school buildings. Therefore, we continue to invest significant resources, organically and through licensing or acquisitions, in developing product offerings that afford us the flexibility to serve different types of customers with varying value propositions and price points that are adaptable to an institution’s capabilities and needs. Moreover, we have and will continue to pursue selected markets outside the United States where we believe our products and services can address local foreign market needs.
 We believe that our core competencies, coupled with the substantial investments we have made in our infrastructure and our prior strategic acquisitions and partnerships, position us to offer educational resources for all types of students. Our products and services offer students expanded educational opportunities regardless of whether a student chooses to remain in a classroom or seeks an alternative educational setting, attends public or private school, lives in the United States or abroad, wants to take online classes on a full or part‑time basis, requires supplemental educational products, seeks career or technical training or is an advanced or remedial student.
 Our Business Lines
 Managed Public School Programs
 As previously discussed, in our Managed Public School Programs we typically provide substantially all of the administrative management, technology and academic support services in addition to curriculum, learning systems and instructional services under the terms of a negotiated service agreement. We provide our Managed Public School Programs to both virtual and blended public school customers.
 We believe that the acceptance of online education in grades K‑12 continues to grow, and anticipate that this will translate into increased demand for our Managed Public School Programs. The independent governing authorities of the virtual charter schools that contract with us are also taking different approaches to virtual education depending upon their 

 
  7

 
own charter school goals. This is reflected in the nature of the agreements we have with those boards and the level of management services that meet their needs. For example, due to our experience and expertise in the integration of all the components necessary to operate a Managed Public School Program, such turnkey arrangements are attractive to many charter school boards.  Conversely, a school board may decide at renewal to transition to a self‑managed model. While these schools continue to purchase our curriculum and some of our management and technology services, they assume more of the operational and academic accountability obligations. In some Managed Public School Programs, full responsibility for academic performance resides with the governing authority or school board which employs the Head of School.
 Virtual Public Schools
 The majority of our revenue is derived from long‑term service agreements with the governing authorities of the virtual public schools we serve. In addition to providing a comprehensive course catalog, related books and physical materials, a learning management system for online learning, and, in certain cases, student computers, we also offer these schools a variety of administrative management, technology and academic support services. Full‑time virtual public school students access online lessons over the Internet and utilize offline learning materials we provide. Students receive assignments, complete lessons, take assessments, and are instructed by certified teachers with whom they interact via email, telephonically, in synchronous virtual classroom environments, and sometimes face‑to‑face (in a non‑managed virtual public school, the level of instructional and/or academic support management, technology services, and academic support services varies or may not be provided depending on the needs of the school). In either case, for parents who believe their child is not thriving in their current school or for students and families who require time or location flexibility in their schooling, virtual and blended public schools can provide a compelling choice. Virtual public school students are also provided the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of school activities, including field trips, service learning opportunities, honor societies, and clubs. In addition to school‑level activities, we sponsor a wide variety of extracurricular activities on a national basis, such as clubs, contests and college and career planning sessions.
 Virtual public schools managed by K12 serve K‑12 students, principally utilize the K12 core curriculum and attract both mainstream and other types of learners. These virtual public schools operate under different brands including Virtual Academies (our original full-time Managed Public School Program), Insight schools (which tend to focus on particular student segments, such as only middle and high school grade levels, at-risk students and career readiness programs), and iQ Academies (which are typically only partially‑managed by us, with responsibility for academic program and regulatory compliance resting with the host school or school district). We also manage career and technical education‑focused online high schools designed to give students a head start on their career goals by earning college credits and workplace experiences.
 Blended Public Schools
 In addition to our full‑time virtual public schools, we offer a variety of management and support services and sell our products to blended public schools, which are public schools that combine online and face‑to‑face instruction for students in a variety of ways with varying amounts of time spent by students in a physical learning center.
 In contrast to a typical brick and mortar public school, blended public schools can provide a greater selection of available courses, increased opportunities for self‑paced, individualized instruction and greater scheduling flexibility.  Our blended schools bring students and teachers physically together more often than a purely online program.
 In some blended schools we manage, such as the Chicago Virtual Charter School, students attend a learning center on a part‑time basis, where they receive face‑to‑face instruction, in addition to their online virtual curriculum and instruction.
 Institutional
 Our Institutional business consists of: (i) Non‑managed Public School Programs; and (ii) Institutional software and services. Public schools and school districts are increasingly adopting these online solutions to launch new learning models, cost‑effectively expand course offerings, provide schedule flexibility, improve student engagement, increase graduation rates, replace textbooks and retain students. State education funds traditionally allocated for textbook and print materials are now also being authorized for the purchase of digital content, including online courses, and in some cases mandated for access to online courses. To address these growing needs, our Institutional business provides curriculum and 

 
  8

 
technology solutions, packaged in a portfolio of flexible learning and delivery models mapped to specific student and/or district needs. This portfolio provides a continuum of delivery models, from full‑time Non‑managed Public School Programs to individual course sales and other options that can be used in traditional classrooms to differentiate instruction. The goal of the Institutional business is to partner primarily with U.S.‑based public schools and school districts to provide more options and better tools to empower teachers to improve student achievement through personalized learning. Our FuelEd suite of offerings has grown and includes K12 curriculum, FuelEd Online Courses, FuelEd Anywhere Learning Systems, Middlebury Interactive Languages, LTS Education Systems, LearnBop and Career Pathways curriculum. Our extensive catalog of online curricula can address specific student needs, including AP, honors programs, world languages, remediation, credit recovery, alternative education, career and technology electives and college readiness. In connection with these solutions, we also offer state‑certified teachers, training for school personnel in online instruction methods, and professional development and other support services as needed by our customers.
 In addition to our extensive curricula catalog, our Institutional business offers the PEAK platform and PEAK Library. PEAK is a proprietary software system designed to centrally manage in a single‑user interface, multiple, independent online solutions. Schools can enroll students, assign courses and teachers, and then manage the learning experience with easy to use reporting and analytics on student progress. The PEAK Library currently supports the K12 curriculum portfolio and teachers can build and modify assignments, assessments and courses to augment classroom instruction and develop lessons for sharing across the school district. PEAK also has the capability to support other third‑party solutions, open educational resources and district and teacher‑created content. For students, teachers and administrators, PEAK eliminates the complexity of managing multiple accounts and roles and provides a consistent online environment for full‑time, credit recovery, world languages or blended classroom programs. We believe increasing ease‑of‑use for administrators and teachers is a critical factor in improving student support and therefore, improving student outcomes. PEAK addresses this need by serving all of the online instructional needs of a school or district in an integrated, data‑driven manner.
 For the 2016-17 school year, we served school districts or individual schools in all 50 states and the District of Columbia through our Institutional business. Based upon school districts’ and academic administrators’ growing acceptance of online learning and desire for cost efficient, integrated and flexible educational solutions, we believe that the direct‑to‑district distribution channel offers further significant growth potential.
     Private Pay Schools and Other
 International and Private Pay Schools
 We operate three different private schools that meet the needs of students ranging from correspondence courses to college preparatory programs. Beyond our business in the United States, we are pursuing international opportunities where we believe there is significant demand for a quality online education. Our international customers are typically expatriate families who wish to study in English and foreign students who desire a U.S. high school diploma.  For the 2016-17 school year, we served students in more than 100 countries. In addition, we have entered into agreements that enable us to distribute our products and services to our international school partners who use our courses to provide broad elective offerings and dual diploma programs.
 We operate the K12 International Academy, an online private school that serves students in both the United States and overseas. Through the K12 International Academy, students may study in a full-time academic program that ultimately leads to an accredited U.S. high school diploma. Students may also enroll in individual courses on a part‑time basis. The K12 International Academy utilizes the same curriculum, systems and teaching practices that we provide to the virtual public schools we manage in the United States. In addition, this school provides a unique international community including online clubs and events that enrich the student experience by allowing students to interact with peers in other countries. The school is accredited by AdvancED, and is recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia as a degree granting institution of secondary learning.
 The Keystone School (“Keystone”) is a private school that has been providing home‑based education and distance learning for over 35 years. Students attend Keystone for middle and high school on a full or part‑time basis. It serves students through online courses with teacher support as well as print correspondence course programs. Keystone primarily uses our FuelEd curriculum and offers a lower‑cost option to families than either of our other two private schools. Keystone is accredited by the Middle States Association—Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools and AdvancED.

 The George Washington University Online High School is operated in cooperation with the George Washington University. The program, which launched in the 2011‑12 school year, offers K12’s college preparatory curriculum and is designed for high school students who are seeking a challenging academic experience and aspire to attend top colleges and universities. The school also provides extensive counseling throughout the high school years to help students make academic and extracurricular choices and maximize their future potential. The school is accredited by the Middle States Association—Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools.
 Consumer Sales
 We also sell individual K-8 online courses and supplemental educational products directly to families. These purchasers desire to educate their children as homeschoolers, outside of the traditional school system or to supplement their child’s existing public or private school education without the aid of an online teacher. Customers of our consumer products have the option of purchasing a complete grade‑level curriculum for grades K-8, individual courses, or a variety of other supplemental products, covering various subjects depending on their child’s needs. Typical applications include summer school course work, home schooling and educational supplements. Our Business Strategy
 We are committed to maximizing every child’s potential by personalizing their educational experience, delivering a quality education to schools and their students, and supporting our customers in their quest to improve academic outcomes and prepare them for college and career readiness. In furtherance of those objectives, we plan to continue investing in our curriculum and learning systems. These investments include initiatives to create and deploy a next generation curriculum and learning platform, improve the effectiveness of our school workforce, develop new instructional approaches to increase student and parental engagement, and improve our systems and security architecture. This strategy consists of the following key elements:
 Deliver better student outcomes. We are committed to improving student outcomes for every student in the schools we serve. To achieve this goal we will: (i) invest in training and professional development for teachers and school leaders; (ii) develop programs and initiatives designed to improve the learning experience, such as our interactive media projects, virtual science labs, AP test prep, specialized cohort academies and Family Academic Support Team (“FAST”) initiatives; (iii) enhance our curriculum to make it more engaging, adaptive and available to all students anywhere; and (iv) update our content as state standards and state assessments change. We will also focus our marketing and enrollment efforts on helping students and families understand the unique demands and challenges of the online learning environment. We believe a better understanding by parents and students will better prepare students for the work and improve their chance at academic success.
 Improve student retention in our virtual schools. To ensure the best outcomes for students, we have partnered with the school boards we serve to make a concerted effort to enroll and retain students who are truly engaged and ready to learn. Research shows that students who remain in the same school setting longer generally perform better academically, and retention is especially challenging with virtual schools because families have the option of enrolling their children in a brick and mortar school or another virtual school. We therefore continue to refine our marketing programs to attract students who are most likely to succeed in a non‑classroom based environment with the expectation of increasing academic success and student retention, recognizing that all students are eligible to enroll consistent with state requirements (e.g. enrollment caps, prior public school student). Once students are enrolled, programs such as Strong Start and FAST implement early intervention and focused engagement and retention strategies, which strive to help students stay on track, improve engagement and ultimately give students a better chance at academic success.
 Introduce New and Improved Products and Services. We intend to continue to expand our product line and offerings, both internally and through licensing or strategic acquisitions of products that address gaps in our current portfolio, including pursuing development and greater use of curriculum and platforms accessible from tablet and mobile devices and leveraging adaptive learning technologies and solutions. In addition, we are endeavoring to serve new charter schools that attract students who are seeking career and technical education.
 Increase Enrollments at Existing Virtual and Blended Public Schools. Some state regulations and school governing authorities and districts limit or cap student enrollment or enrollment growth. At the direction of our school board and school district customers, we will seek to provide an opportunity for more students to attend these schools, and 

 
  10

 
support their efforts to work with legislators, state departments of education, educators and parents to remove those enrollment caps.
 Expand Virtual and Blended Public School Presence into Additional States and Cities. As laws change and opportunities arise, we work with states and school districts to authorize and establish new virtual and blended public schools and to contract with them to provide our curriculum, online learning platform, management services, and other related offerings.
 Accelerate Institutional Business. The breadth of our FuelEd catalog, now ranging from pre‑K to 12th grade, our instructional capabilities and our capacity to simplify a school district’s management of multiple digital programs and vendors through our PEAK technology platform, are the key drivers for Institutional business growth. We will continue to work to accelerate the market adoption of these solutions and services as school districts partner with us to address a variety of academic needs and personalized learning for their students. We will continue to seek acquisitions of businesses that expand FuelEd’s distribution and product portfolio, improve our platform and capabilities, and allow us to enter new markets to serve every child who is interested in the benefits of digital learning.
 Add Enrollments in Our Private Schools. We currently operate three online private schools that we believe appeal to a broad range of students and families. We look to drive increased enrollments in these schools by increasing awareness, through targeted marketing programs and by solicitation of partnerships with traditional brick and mortar private schools.
 Pursue International Opportunities to Offer Our Learning Systems. We believe there is strong worldwide demand for high‑quality, online education from U.S. families living abroad, foreign students who seek a U.S.‑style of education and the schools and school systems that serve them in their local market. Our ability to operate virtually is not constrained by the need for a physical classroom or local teachers, which makes our learning systems ideal for use internationally.
 Develop Additional Channels through Which to Deliver Our Learning Systems. We plan to evaluate other delivery channels on a routine basis and to pursue opportunities where we believe there is likely to be significant demand for our offering, such as direct classroom instruction, blended classroom models, career and technical education, supplemental educational products and individual products packaged and sold directly to consumers.
 Pursue Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions. We may pursue selective acquisitions that complement our existing educational offerings and business capabilities, and that are natural extensions of our core competencies. We may also pursue opportunities with highly‑respected institutions where we can be a valued‑added partner or contribute our expertise in curriculum development and educational services to serve more students.
 Products and Services
 Educational Philosophy
 A primary focus of our educational philosophy is to make the academic performance of students our first priority. We are committed to continuously improving the quality of our curriculum and academic programs, including alignment to all state adopted standards and assessments (tests which are designed to measure specific elements of learning) and with states that have adopted the Common Core State Standards (“CCSS”) and the Common Core Assessments. We also continue to evaluate and use innovative technologies to deliver engaging and effective learning experiences for all students. We seek to leverage our product portfolios across our educational solutions and distribution channels and to invest in our content portfolio to ensure our students receive a meaningful learning experience that is individualized, engaging, accessible and effective.
 The design, development and delivery of our products and services are grounded in the following set of guiding principles:

· | To deliver learning systems that are designed to help drive academic success and student engagement. Our programs include a wide variety of curriculum and course options, onboarding programs to support our families and schools, as well as tools to support the overall engagement and student management. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  11

 


· | Employ Technology Appropriately for Learning. All of our courses are delivered primarily through an online platform and generally include a significant amount of online content. We employ technology where it is appropriate and can enhance the learning process, with the amount of online content increasing at higher grades. In addition to online content, our curriculum includes a rich mix of courses with and without materials. Furthermore, teachers utilize a variety of collaboration and communication tools to help support student and family communication. We believe our balanced use of technology and more traditional approaches helps to maximize the effectiveness of our learning systems. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Assess Objectives to Ensure Mastery. Ongoing assessments are the most effective way to evaluate a student’s mastery of a lesson or concept. To facilitate effective assessment, our curriculum states clear objectives for each lesson. Throughout a course, every student’s progress is assessed at a point when each objective is expected to be mastered, providing direction for appropriate pacing. These periodic and well‑timed assessments reinforce learning and promote mastery of a topic before a student moves to the next lesson or course. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Individualized Learning. We seek to create engaging curriculum content to capture a student’s attention to make learning more interesting and effective. It is our fundamental belief that each student learns in a highly individualized manner. Our instructional system allows students to learn from a curriculum that caters to their unique learning style and offers a high degree of program flexibility. Certain adaptive learning features are being integrated into some curricular products, which can individualize lessons based on the level of student comprehension. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Prioritize Important, Rigorous Objectives. Our content experts have developed a clear understanding of those subjects and concepts that are difficult for students, from both historical and cognitive points of view. Greater instructional effort is focused on the most important and most challenging concepts (as revealed by experience and research). We use existing research, feedback from parents and students, and experienced teacher judgments to determine these priorities, to modify our learning systems to guide the allocation of each student’s time and effort, and to align with evolving state curriculum and testing blueprints. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Facilitate Flexibility to Accommodate Variations in Ability. We believe that each student should have access to a variety of instructional solutions that help challenge each student appropriately. Generally, meaningful progress for most students is to complete one academic year’s curriculum within a traditional school year. Our learning systems are designed to facilitate this flexibility to motivate and challenge each student to master each lesson. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ensure Fundamental Content Soundness. Our highly credentialed subject matter experts or “Content Specialists” bring their own scholarly and teaching backgrounds to course design and development and are required to maintain relationships with and awareness of guidelines from over 65 national and international subject‑area associations.

  Academic Performance
 Our fundamental goal for every child who enrolls in a virtual public or private school managed by us, or a program offered through a school district or a Non‑managed school, is to improve his or her academic performance. In fiscal year 2017, we published our 2016 K12 Annual Academic Report (“2016 Academic Report”) which is available at http://k12.com/academic-report. The 2016 Academic Report was expanded to include all Managed Public School Programs with reported state test results as well as additional results from key high school assessments.  By analyzing and communicating the results of our efforts, we aim to provide data for school boards and parents as they exercise school choice options, and to help educators working to improve academic achievement for every child in our increasingly diverse schools. The test results included in our 2016 Academic Report that were aligned to new state standards and based on different definitions of proficiency cannot be compared to scores on state tests from previous years. To provide a more meaningful report, we only included year-over-year results for schools that had not experienced a testing program change over the prior year, we organized our analyses into groups according to test type 

 
  12

 
and we reported data in context by comparing performance at school and state levels.  We believe that none of our competitors serving virtual public schools publishes this volume or depth of academic performance data and analytics.
     Each of the jurisdictions in which we manage virtual public schools measures academic performance using different state accountability methods. A number of states have adopted the Common Core State Standards for curriculum content and one of the two online assessment methods aligned to those standards, the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (“SBAC”) or the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (“PARCC”). However, as of school year 2016-17, a majority of the states in which we operate rely on their own state‑developed standards and assessments or commercially available assessments. Some states use a combination of a state‑developed test and either the PARCC or SBAC test, while other states in which we operate never adopted the CCSS, including Virginia and Texas.
 In the 2014‑2015 school year, many states changed their required assessments. Across all K12 public school programs, only eight states did not change their state required tests in 2014‑2015: Iowa, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming. The changes in state tests were in part a consequence of the Common Core State Standards, initially released in 2010. In that year, most states began the process of adopting the Common Core standards, encouraged by the federal grant program called Race to the Top, which favored applicants that agreed to adopt Common Core. The new content standards required new assessments, so to develop assessments aligned to the Common Core, the federal government funded two testing consortia, the PARCC and the SBAC. At one time, 24 states and the District of Columbia were signed on to administer the PARCC assessments. However, in the 2014‑2015 school year, only the District of Columbia and 10 states fully administered the PARCC assessments. The Education Commission of the States notes that in 2015‑2016, only six states and the District of Columbia used the PARCC assessments. While the SBAC consortium has experienced fewer withdrawals, its members decreased to 15 states that administered the full SBAC assessment in the 2015‑2016 school year. For the 2016-17 school year, 7 states administered the PARCC assessment and 14 states administered the SBAC assessment. Fewer states changed their state-developed assessments from the 2015-16 to 2016-17 school year than the previous year.
 We share the view taken by many states that assessing a student’s academic performance by his or her learning growth is a more accurate measure of a school’s effectiveness than attaining a static proficiency score. Most of our schools administer nationally‑recognized interim and/or benchmark assessments to measure student growth during the school year, to prepare students for state assessments and to guide instruction. To ensure all schools are utilizing best practices learned from the successful schools we manage and from other high performing schools across the country, we have implemented a standardized academic framework across all of the Managed Public School Programs that addresses teacher preparation, delivery of instruction, and student assessment. Effective instruction is informed by and evaluated based on student‑level data. As part of the academic framework, schools implement plans to collect student‑level data throughout the year from three types of assessments: diagnostic, formative interim, and summative. Baseline assessments are used to determine a student’s academic strengths and weaknesses and are administered at the beginning of the school year or when a student enrolls. Formative interim assessments are administered throughout the year to assess student mastery of the state standards and objectives. Summative assessments measure student learning at culminating points in a student’s academic career, such as the end of the semester or the end of the school year. In most cases, state tests serve as the summative assessment for schools. We provide recommendations for benchmark and interim formative assessments based on state standards and state assessments. In several cases charter authorizers, district partners or departments of education require specific assessments.
 In addition to the complexities involved in measuring academic performance of students, we believe the virtual public schools we serve face unique challenges impacting academic success not necessarily encountered to the same extent by traditional brick and mortar schools. These challenges include students who enter behind grade level or under‑credited, high student mobility, lack of control over the student learning environment and higher than average percentages of students eligible for free or reduced‑price lunch in many states. With rare exceptions, the data shows that students identified as eligible for free lunch had lower percentages at or above proficiency levels than students eligible for reduced‑price lunch, and both groups usually underperformed students identified as not eligible for subsidized meals. In addition, for decades, educational research has shown that persistence—remaining and proceeding at pace in the same school setting—can benefit academic performance, while mobility—moving from one school setting to another—can have a destabilizing influence, causing students to struggle and lapse in academic performance.  
 While measuring academic performance is necessary, taking meaningful steps to improve student outcomes is an integral part of our mission. Accordingly, we continually strive to achieve that objective by undertaking new initiatives and improving existing programs, such as Strong Start and FAST. To monitor student learning progress during the school 

 
  13

 
year, we are using multiple equivalent assessments at the lesson, unit and semester level to ensure that our measurement of mastery is reliable and valid, introducing more synchronous sessions for at risk students, and using data driven instruction that provides for targeted teacher intervention to assist students with lesson challenges.
 In furtherance of our goal to improve academic performance, in fiscal year 2014 we established an Academic Committee of the K12 Board of Directors comprised of three members. The primary role of the Academic Committee is to make recommendations and assist management in discharging its responsibility to ensure continuous improvement in academic outcomes for the public and private schools served by K12. With input and oversight from the Academic Committee, the education experts who are members of our K12 Educational Advisory Committee (“EAC”), formed in 2013, will further improve our focus on academic achievement and growth goals as well as advising us on specific tactics to be successful in these areas. The EAC met 3 times in fiscal year 2017. The members of our EAC are:

  Our Products
 Our product approach is to continue investing in curriculum and technology to educate students more effectively and efficiently. Much of our investment has been in the development of K‑12 online courses and management systems. We are planning specialized courses and programs designed to remediate the rapidly increasing number of students who are enrolling in schools behind grade level. Specifically, we are making, licensing or acquiring more individualized learning programs for students using adaptive learning technology, which requires a significant financial commitment to license or acquire, integrate and develop a specialized curriculum and a complex database.
 As school districts confront the same issues that we are experiencing in managed public schools, we believe that our products could have applicability across a broader range of schools. We are continuing to develop new courses and materials aimed at engaging a broad spectrum of learners. 
 In addition, our PEAK system provides school districts and administrators a better way to manage their online education programs and content. In 2014, we entered into an agreement to transition our high school learning management system (“LMS”) to Desire2Learn, a pioneer in next‑generation digital education systems. During school year 2015‑16, we migrated the virtual high schools we manage to this new platform, and it is anticipated that the migration for middle school will be completed in time for school year 2017-2018. The new online high school and middle school LMS was designed to empower, engage, and help students achieve better academic results.  The new user experience includes planning features that help students advance through their schoolwork, as well as course management tools that allow teachers to tailor a curriculum that best meets the unique needs of their students, and a host of other features.
 Just as we pioneered the development of virtual schools, we are resolved to address the most challenging educational needs facing schools and districts. Our goal is to assist teachers, schools and districts in implementing individualized education programs to better serve their students. This can take a variety of forms including turn‑key solutions, partnerships, vendor relationships, enterprise licenses, and purchases of curriculum and services.

 Curriculum
 K12 has one of the largest digital curriculum portfolios for the K‑12 online education industry. The K12 curriculum consists of a variety of online lessons and resources, offline instructional kits and materials and lesson guides. A single year‑long K12 course generally consists of 120 to 180 unique instructional lessons. Each lesson is designed to last approximately 45 to 60 minutes, although students are able to work at their own pace. We have a broad‑based curriculum that includes courses across kindergarten, elementary, middle and high school, including world languages.
 Since our inception, we have built core courses in English language arts, mathematics, science and history on a foundation of rigorous standards, following the guidance and recommendations of leading educational organizations at the national and state levels. For this reason, our K12 curriculum was well positioned to satisfy the requirements of the CCSS when they were published in June 2010. As the CCSS landscape is continually changing, we will monitor the decisions that states are making with regard to CCSS adoption and the associated assessments of the CCSS or other standards the states may adopt, which in turn may require further adjustments. We have and will continue to invest in and update our curriculum to stay current with emerging and developing standards like CCSS.
 Online Lessons. For school year 2016-17, our K12 online lessons were accessed by K‑5 students through a proprietary learning management platform, which we call our Online School (“OLS”). Lessons are accessed through a third‑party platform by high school students, as well as a number of other common industry platforms for students who access our FuelEd Online Courses. Each online lesson provides the roadmap for the entire lesson, including direction to specific online and offline materials, summaries of major objectives for the lesson and the actual lesson content with assessments. Digital versions of documents, readings, labs and other activities may also be included. Lessons utilize a combination of innovative technologies, including animations, demonstrations, audio, video and other graphic/digital interactivity, educational games and individualized feedback, all coordinated with offline textbooks and hands‑on materials, to create an engaging, responsive and highly‑effective curriculum. The formative and periodic summative, online assessments help ensure that students have mastered the material and are ready to proceed to the next lesson, allowing them to work at their own pace. Pronunciation guides for key words and references to suggested additional resources, specific to each lesson and each student’s assignments and assessments, are also included.
 Learning Kits. Many of our courses utilize learning kits in conjunction with the online lessons to maximize the effectiveness of our learning systems. In addition to receiving access to our online lessons through the Internet, each K‑8 student receives a shipment of materials, including textbooks, art supplies, laboratory supplies (e.g., microscopes, scales, science specimens) and other reference materials which are referred to and incorporated in instruction throughout our curriculum. This approach is consistent with our guiding principle to utilize technology where appropriate for our learning systems, and combine it with other effective instructional methods. We have also created and/or converted additional K12 textbooks and resources used across our courses into an electronic format, enabling us to offer options to enhance the student experience without physical books.
 Lesson Guides. Our courses are generally paired with a lesson guide and/or teacher resources. These resources are designed to work in coordination with the online lessons and include the following: overview information for learning coaches, lesson objectives, lesson outlines and activities, answer keys to student exercises and suggestions for explaining difficult concepts to students.
 Pre‑K and K‑8 Courses
 From pre‑kindergarten through 8th grade, our courses are generally categorized into seven major subject areas: English language arts, mathematics, science, history, art, music and world languages. Our online curriculum includes all of the courses that students need to complete their core kindergarten through 8th grade education; our pre‑K offering, which we refer to as EmbarK12, introduces students to core subjects through cross‑curricular thematic units, building initial and fundamental relationships among concepts. Courses focus on developing fundamental skills and teaching the key knowledge building blocks or schemas—the “big ideas” that each student will need to master the major subject areas, meet state standards, including those formulated as the CCSS, and complete more advanced coursework. Unlike a traditional classroom education, and in conjunction with school teachers and counselors, our learning systems offer the flexibility for each student to take courses at different grade levels in a single academic year, providing flexibility for students to progress at their own level and pace within each subject area.

 Our K12 elementary language arts program is designed to deliver increased interactivity and make instruction even more engaging and efficient while integrating rewards, interactive practice and a virtual world. These courses support students at various skill levels via targeted, timely remediation, embody CCSS and include significant media integration. In addition, the flexibility of our learning systems allows us to tailor our curriculum to state specific requirements. For example, we have developed a large catalog of courses specifically created for the public school standards in 20 states; we are aligning our courses to the CCSS and the Common Core Assessments; and in addition to the ongoing evolution of our K‑5 Math+ program, we have also created custom Math+ sequences to serve specific state needs.
 High School Courses
 The curriculum available to high school students is much broader and varies from student to student, largely as a result of the increased flexibility in course selection available to high school students. Students also are able to select from a wide range of electives. We have augmented our lab program for lab science courses with the creation of alternate kit‑free science labs as an augmentation or alternative for our formerly kit‑based high school science labs in order to provide a more flexible and robust lab program across our physical science, earth science, biology, chemistry and physics courses. Our overall lab program now includes traditional kit‑based labs based on either shipped‑in or household materials, virtual labs, video‑based labs, data‑collection and data‑manipulation labs, and field studies. This array provides schools with additional materials flexibility, and integrates diverse modalities directly into our science curriculum to promote conceptual mastery. Across all subject areas, the K12 proprietary core curriculum accounts for more than three quarters of our high school course enrollments. As standards change, we align our courses to the CCSS and the Common Core Assessments as well as various evolving state standards. We have already released over 40 new courses to help support our focus on career and technical education, and we are planning to launch another 46 courses for school year 2017-2018.
 FuelEd Online Courses. We also offer curriculum to schools and school districts marketed as our FuelEd Online Courses product line. Most FuelEd Online Courses are aligned to state and national standards, including many to the CCSS, and include a large number of courses for middle and high school students, featuring core, AP, elective and credit recovery courses. FuelEd’s Online Courses are developed by subject matter experts, designed by multimedia teams and may be taught by Company‑provided instructors at the customers’ option. FuelEd classes are primarily delivered over the Internet in a classroom or virtual setting, and use a variety of interactive elements to keep students engaged. A deep understanding of K‑12 pedagogy, as well as the human factors associated with online technology, is integrated into FuelEd’s courses. New to the FuelEd offerings this year are adaptive credit recovery courses in math, English, physical education, health, and world languages.
 Middlebury Interactive Languages. We offer digital world language courses and residential summer language academies through MIL, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary in FY 2017 through our purchase of Middlebury College’s interest in the joint venture. As part of that transaction, we retained the right to use the MIL name in its products through April 2028. In addition, we secured the right to use the MIL name in marketing materials through December 2019. These offerings include immersive language courses for K‑12 students based on Middlebury College’s pedagogy to help students gain a stronger base of comprehension and accelerate language acquisition. The age‑appropriate language courses, which can be implemented fully online, in a blended learning environment or as supplemental material, use instructional tools such as animation, music, videos and other authentic materials to immerse students in the language and culture of study. We offer Chinese, French, German and Spanish courses for elementary, middle and high school students. In addition, MIL has developed a summer English language learner (“ELL”) curriculum and new, digital, supplemental ELL courses for middle and high school students to be used in a blended environment. MIL also operates summer residential language academies, an immersive program for middle and high school students. Academy students live in language by taking the Language Pledge, a promise to communicate solely in their language of study for four weeks. Instruction is offered in Arabic, Chinese, French, German and Spanish at multiple college campuses in Vermont, as well as in France, Spain and China in their respective local languages.
 Innovative Learning Applications
 In order to continue to enhance the user experience and instructional methods of our learning systems, we strive to leverage new technologies to adapt our curriculum to new devices and platforms while developing algorithms and models to build an adaptive curriculum.
· | Mobile Device Learning: We offer mobile applications that create the ability for a student to learn “on‑the‑go,” allowing for more continuous learning, engagement and mastery of content. In addition, we 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

rolled out our first fully mobile‑enabled courseware in the fall of 2014 and have developed a core mobile catalog of courses.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interactive Games: An active educational games initiative is delivering new methods for engagement, practice and review of K‑12 concepts, including: narrative/immersive styles, rewards, persistent data, and complex algorithms. In fiscal year 2016, we acquired a game-based learning system that is designed to help students accelerate learning and practice on state standards. These games make use of extensive research and educational best practices and address targeted learning objectives. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Virtual Labs: We have delivered alternatives for our educational partners who desire materials‑free curriculum. This includes converting many of our existing materials‑based high school science labs into highly interactive virtual labs and video lab simulations that meet state standards and still maintain teaching the original learning objectives. For example, in high school chemistry we have developed a virtual laboratory on chromatography, in which students separate a number of inks into their component pigments. This laboratory is performed at a virtual lab bench with all the materials and with the same procedures high school students would use in a physical chemistry laboratory. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | eBook and Digital Book Distribution: Through fiscal year 2017, we have created or converted additional K12 textbooks used across our courses into an electronic format, including textbooks, reference guides, literature readers and lab manuals. This digital delivery ability enables us to offer options to our customers via interactive online books that enhance the student’s reading experience, reinforce the student’s learning approach and create a new method for delivering book and print materials. Each offline book is converted into an electronic book format with a custom user interface to be viewed via a standard web browser or a commercially available electronic reader (e.g. Kindle, Nook). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adaptive Learning: We offer certain courses that are adaptive, which enable individualized learning experiences as the course “adapts” at key points to student behavior and input. Based on assessment results or individual activity, these courses can automatically route students to an alternate explanation, additional practice or remediation on a prerequisite skill or crucial concept. In addition to remediation, the capability allows students to accelerate past previously mastered concepts, giving skillful students time for more challenging work. Our new Summit curriculum provides differentiated paths to our students depending on the mastery of specific objectives within the curriculum. Our MARK12 reading remediation product captures individual students’ successes and challenges as they practice phonemic awareness, alphabetic principles, accuracy and fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. The program serves the individual student more exercises, practice and review in areas of difficulty. Adaptation in this way tailors the instruction automatically for each student, making learning experiences more efficient and effective by building into the course the logic an expert teacher or tutor uses to differentiate instruction.

· | Engaging Videos: We continue to explore opportunities to enhance student engagement through strategic use of relevant multimedia. For example, we introduce concepts in our Summit math curriculum with a 60 second video that illustrates the application of a specific math concept in practical applications to provide context for students. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Learning Management Systems
 For our K12 curriculum users in grades K‑5 in school year 2016-17, we provided a proprietary learning management system, our OLS platform. The OLS platform is a significant part of our ongoing effort to provide a productive learning experience for students. The OLS platform is a web‑based software platform that provides access to our online lessons, our lesson planning and scheduling tools, and our progress tracking tool which serves a key role in assisting parents and teachers in managing each student’s progress. The OLS platform is also the central system through which students, parents, teachers and administrators interact using an integrated email solution and Class Connect (our integrated synchronous session scheduler).
· | Lesson Planning and Scheduling Tools. During a school year, a typical full-time K-5 student will complete hundreds of lessons across six or more subject areas. In the OLS platform, our lesson planning and scheduling tools enable teachers and parents to establish an individualized plan for each student to complete his or her lessons. These tools are designed to dynamically update the lesson plan as a student progresses through each

  17

 

lesson and course, allowing flexibility to increase or decrease the pace at which the student advances through the curriculum while ensuring that the student progresses towards completion in the desired time frame. Moreover, changes can be made to the schedule at any point during the school year and the remainder of the student’s schedule will automatically be adjusted in the OLS platform. Unlike a traditional classroom education, our learning systems offer the flexibility for each student to take courses at different grade levels in a single academic year, providing flexibility for students to progress at their own level and pace within each subject area. The curriculum includes assessments built into every lesson to guide and tailor the pace of progress to each child’s needs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Progress Tracking Tools. Once a schedule has been established, the OLS platform delivers lessons based upon the specified parameters of the school and the teacher. Each day, a student is initially directed to a home page listing the schedule for that particular day and begins the school day by selecting one of the listed lessons. As each lesson is completed, the student returns to the day’s schedule to proceed to the next subject. If a student does not complete a lesson by the end of the day on which it was originally scheduled, the lesson will be rescheduled to the next day and will resume at the point where the student left off. Our progress tracking tool allows students, parents, learning coaches and teachers to monitor student progress. In addition, information collected by our tracking tool regarding attendance and other pertinent data are transferred to our proprietary TotalView system for use in providing administrative support services. This instructional program includes several processes and educational techniques that embrace proactive intervention. As a result, we can provide high quality instruction and intervention aligned to student needs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In fiscal year 2014, we entered into a strategic license agreement with Desire2Learn, a pioneer in next‑generation digital education systems and learning platforms. At the beginning of school year 2015‑16, we implemented this new virtual learning platform at the high schools we serve and we extended the platform to the middle schools we serve in school year 2016-17. Similar to our OLS platform, this new platform enables lesson planning, scheduling, tracking student progress and conducting assessments. The platform is used by over 50 K‑12 organizations, and provides an industry‑leading student experience which should help us improve student engagement, retention and outcomes for the Managed Public School Programs we serve.
 The new platform helps us deliver a more personalized experience to our students and teachers. The intuitive experience enables students to access pertinent information more easily. This platform also includes an assessment tracking tool that enables teachers to easily view assessment data for their students so that they can proactively provide additional instruction to students as needed. Our assessment tools help us improve learning programs by providing information on the effectiveness of instructional activities and curriculum. Furthermore, our learning programs make use of a variety of formative and summative assessment instruments:

· | Lesson assessments that verify mastery of the objectives for that lesson and help determine whether further study of the lesson is necessary.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Unit assessments that show whether or not the student has retained key learning objectives for the unit, and identify specific objectives students may need to review before progressing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Semester assessments that verify student mastery of key learning objectives for the semester.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The platform also provides additional tools and reports that enable teachers to have better insights into students’ progress and enable students to manage their day more effectively.
 TotalView
 TotalView is our proprietary student information system. TotalView is integrated with the OLS, the Desire2Learn system, and several other proprietary systems including our online enrollment system that allows parents to complete school enrollment forms online and our Order Management System that generates orders for learning kits and computers to be delivered to students. TotalView stores student specific data and is used for a variety of functions, including enrolling students in courses, assigning progress marks and grades, tracking student demographic data, and generating student transcripts. The TotalView suite of online applications provides administrators, teachers, parents and students a unified view of student attendance, communications, and learning kit shipment tracking.

 
  18

 

 TotalView also includes an enrollment processing and tracking tool that allows us to closely monitor and manage the enrollment process for new students. Over the past several years, we have enhanced TotalView with additional functionality to better support the operation of the virtual and blended public schools.
 PEAK
 Institutional business offers an innovative platform called PEAK and the PEAK Library. PEAK is a proprietary software system designed to centrally manage in a single‑user interface multiple, independent online school‑based functions. Schools can enroll and activate students, assign courses and teachers, and then manage the learning experience with easy to use reporting and analytics on student progress. In addition, through the PEAK Library, teachers can build and modify assignments, assessments and courses and can augment classroom instruction and develop lessons for sharing across the school district. PEAK also has the capability to support other third‑party solutions, open educational resources and district and teacher‑created content. In fiscal year 2017, PEAK served nearly 900 school districts and school partners and nearly 400,000 students. As more districts adopt online learning, they are demanding more control and flexibility in managing their programs. PEAK provides extensive capabilities for districts wanting to operate multiple solutions or catalogs from a single application and offers rich personalization features that can be managed at the district, school or teacher level. Our Services
 We offer a comprehensive suite of services to students and their families as well as directly to virtual and blended public schools, traditional schools and school districts. Our services can be categorized broadly into: academic support services; and management and technology services. Academic Support Services
 Teachers and Related Services. Teachers are critical to students’ educational success. Many teachers in the virtual and blended public schools that we manage are employed by the school, with the ultimate authority over these teachers residing with the school’s governing body, including final hiring and termination decisions. As part of our service agreements, we typically are engaged to recruit, train and provide management support for these school‑employed teachers. For our Institutional business customers, we provide instructors as needed using our staff of state‑certified teachers and trainers.
 We use a rigorous evaluation process for making teacher hiring recommendations to the schools we manage. We generally recruit teachers who, at a minimum, are state certified and meet each state’s requirements for designation as a “Highly Qualified Teacher.” We also seek to recruit teachers who have the skill set necessary to be successful in a virtual environment. Teaching in a virtual or blended public school is characterized by enhanced one‑on‑one student‑teacher and parent‑teacher interaction, so these teachers must have strong interpersonal communications skills. Additionally, a virtual or blended public school teacher must be creative in finding ways to effectively connect with their students and integrate themselves into the daily lives of the students’ families. We assess these teacher characteristics by requiring teachers to deliver and record a sample lesson on our online platform and answer questions both via video and essay as part of the hiring screening process. Throughout a teacher’s employment in a managed program, we provide tools for teacher management and evaluation.  In most managed public schools, we are also piloting an instructional coaching program, where experienced teachers provide coaching to other teachers to help improve the quality of instruction in the schools.
 New teachers participate in our comprehensive training program during which, among other things, they are introduced to our educational philosophy, our curriculum and technology applications, and are provided strategies for communicating and connecting with students and their families in a virtual environment. We also provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers so that they may stay abreast of changing educational standards, key learning trends, and sound pedagogical strategies which we believe enhance their teaching abilities and effectiveness.
 Advanced and Special Education Services. We believe that our learning systems can be appropriate to address the educational needs of both advanced and special education students because they employ flexible teaching methods and students can use them at their own pace. For students requiring special attention, we employ a national director who is an expert on the delivery of special education services in a virtual or blended public school environment and who supports the special education programs at the schools we serve. While compliance with federal and state special education laws resides primarily with our managed public school customers, we periodically review and, in cooperation with the schools, 

 
  19

 
may assist and facilitate the development and implementation of Individualized Education Plans for students with special needs and for English Language Learners (“ELL”). Each student with special needs is assigned a certified special education teacher and the school arranges for any required ancillary services, including speech and occupational therapy, and any required assistive technologies, such as special computer displays or speech recognition software. We support advanced and talented students through our advanced learner program.
 Supporting Academically At‑Risk Learners. Our objective is to narrow the achievement gap for those students who enter our virtual or blended public schools behind their same‑age peers. To that end, students are given both formative and summative assessments during the course of the school year in order to identify those students needing specific remedial support and measure the effectiveness of the support. We also offer a program designed for academically at‑risk students, particularly those who have previously dropped out of high school, and which includes more counseling and support services.
 Student Support Services. We provide students attending virtual or blended public schools that we manage and their families with a variety of support services as a means to help them meet their educational needs and goals, and to address any questions or concerns that students and their parents have during the course of their education. We plan and coordinate social events to offer students opportunities to meet and socialize with their school peers where practical. Finally, in connection with our high school offering, each student is assigned a homeroom teacher, and/or an advisor and a guidance counselor who assists them with academic issues, college and career planning and other support as needed.
 During school year 2016-17, we completed our two-year nationwide rollout of Students First. Students First is a series of programs that encompass the entire student experience, from on-boarding to personalized outreach to academic and support services for struggling students and surveys for gauging satisfaction and adapting support services. 
 We are also making substantial investments in our service offerings to improve student outcomes. For example, as part of our Strong Start student onboarding program, we offered a diagnostic assessment tool that a number of Managed Public School Programs have utilized to develop targeted instructional plans for new students who often start school with us before their academic records arrive. In addition, we offer the FAST program in many of the Managed Public School Programs. The purpose of FAST is to help students prepare for their online learning experience by assisting them with non-academic barriers. 
 Management and Technology Services 
 Turn‑key Services. For most Managed Public School Programs, we provide a turn‑key suite of services whereby we take responsibility for all aspects of the management of the schools, including the provision of online curriculum and lesson materials, monitoring academic achievement, teacher hiring recommendations and training, financial management and regulatory compliance, marketing and enrollment support, and provision of computers and other required products and services.
 Accreditation. In 2013, AdvancED renewed our corporate accreditation for another five years. AdvancED is a non‑profit organization that serves more than 30,000 public and private schools and districts across the United States. It was created by the merger of the preK‑12 divisions of the North Central Accreditation Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Council on Accreditation and School Improvement, and the subsequent addition of the Northwest Accreditation Commission. Many of the schools we manage also maintain school accreditation through AdvancED and also through regional accreditations with other accrediting associations.
 Compliance and Tracking Services. Operating a virtual or blended public school entails many of the compliance and regulatory requirements of a traditional public school, as well as applicable charter provisions or other requirements specifically adopted for online public schools. We have developed management systems and processes designed to track compliance with those requirements, including tracking appropriate student information and meeting various state and federal reporting, record keeping and privacy requirements for the schools we serve. For example, we collect enrollment related information, monitor attendance and administer proctored state tests. Further, as we have expanded into new states, our processes have grown increasingly robust. In fiscal year 2014, we created the position of Chief School Compliance Officer (“CSCO”) to supplement and oversee school compliance. Among other responsibilities, our CSCO complements our corporate compliance and ethics function and reviews and advises our managed public schools on applicable regulatory 

 
  20

 
policies, practices and procedures. The CSCO provides a school compliance report semi‑annually to the Audit Committee, or more frequently on various matters as requested by the Committee.
 Financial Management Services. For the schools we manage, we oversee the preparation of the annual budget and coordinate with the school’s governing body to determine its annual objectives. In addition, we implement an internal control framework, develop policies and procedures, provide accounting services and payroll administration, oversee all federal entitlement programs, and arrange for external audits and support state and local financial compliance reporting by the schools.
 Facility, Operations and Technology Support Services. We generally operate administrative offices and all other facilities on behalf of the schools we manage. We provide these schools with technology infrastructure. In addition, we provide a comprehensive help desk solution for students and school staff to address their computer or other technical issues.
 Human Resources Support Services. We are actively involved in recruiting virtual and blended public school administrators, teachers and staff, through a thorough interview and orientation process. To better facilitate the hiring process, we review and analyze the profiles of teachers that have been highly effective in our managed public and blended schools learning systems to identify the attributes desired in future new hires. While many schools employ teachers directly, we also help negotiate and secure employment benefits and payroll services for school staff on behalf of the schools and administer employee benefit plans for school employees. Additionally, we assist the schools we serve in drafting and implementing administrative policies and procedures.
 Competition
 As a general matter, we face varying degrees of competition from a variety of education companies because the scope of our offerings and the customers we serve encompass many separate and distinct segments of the education business. We compete primarily with companies that provide online curriculum and school support services to K‑12 virtual and blended public schools, and school districts. These companies include Pearson PLC (Connections Academy and Advanced Academics), Lincoln Learning Solutions, Inspire Charter Schools, and Charter Schools USA, among others. We also face competition from online and print curriculum developers. The online curriculum providers include Apex Learning Inc., Curriculum Associates, Achieve 3000, Edgenuity Inc., Glynlyon, Inc., Edmentum Inc., Renaissance Learning, Inc., Rosetta Stone Inc. and traditional textbook publishers including Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, McGraw‑Hill Companies and Pearson PLC. Other competing online curriculum providers, including Khan Academy, Duolingo, IXL Learning, Inc. and LearnZillion, Inc., offer a “freemium” model which provides curriculum at no charge but charges for additional products or services and certain other providers. We also compete with institutions such as The Laurel Springs School (Nobel Learning Communities, Inc.) and Penn Foster Inc. for online private school students. Additionally, we compete with state‑administered online programs such as Florida Virtual School.
 We believe that the primary factors on which we compete are:

· | extensive experience in, and understanding of, K‑12 virtual schooling;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | track record of student academic gains and customer satisfaction;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | quality of integrated curriculum and materials with an online delivery platform;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | qualifications, experience and training teachers for online instruction;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | comprehensiveness of school management and student support services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | platform designed to allow school district partners to centrally manage multiple online solutions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | integrated K‑12 solutions, with components designed and built to work together;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to scale across our lines of business; and
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
 
  21

 


· | sophisticated government affairs knowledge and experience in virtual school regulatory environments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Broadly speaking, we participate in the market for K‑12 education. In states where we enter into long‑term service agreements to manage virtual and blended public schools, we believe that we generally serve less than 1% of the public school students in that state. The customers for Institutional business are schools and school districts seeking individual courses to supplement their course catalogs or school districts seeking to offer an online education program to serve the needs of a small subset of their overall student population. Defining a more precise relevant market upon which to base a share estimate would not be meaningful due to significant limitations on the comparability of data among jurisdictions. For example, some providers to K‑12 virtual public schools serve only high school students; others serve the elementary and middle school students, and some serve both. There are also providers of online virtual K‑12 education that operate solely within individual states or geographic regions rather than globally as we do. Furthermore, some school districts offer their own virtual programs with which we compete. Parents in search of an alternative to their local public school have a number of alternatives beyond virtual and blended public schools, including private schools, public charter schools and home schooling. In our International and Private Pay schools, we compete for students seeking an English‑based K‑12 education worldwide, and we currently draw students from more than 100 countries. In addition, our integrated learning systems consist of components that face competition from many different types of education companies, such as traditional textbook publishers, test and assessment firms and private education management companies. Finally, our learning systems are designed to operate domestically and internationally over the Internet, and thus the geographic market for many of our products and services is global and indeterminate in size.
 Key Functional Areas
 Public Affairs, School Development, Student Recruitment and Marketing
 We seek to increase public awareness of the educational and fiscal benefits of our online learning options through full‑time virtual and blended instructional models as well as supplementary course options. We receive numerous inquiries from school districts, legislators, public charter school boards, community leaders, state departments of education, educators and parents who express the desire to have a choice in public school options. Our public affairs and school development teams work together with these interested parties to identify and pursue opportunities to expand the use of our products and services in new and existing jurisdictions.
 Our student recruitment and marketing team is focused on promoting the K-12 online education category and generating enrollments for the Company’s virtual school customers within that category.  This is achieved by creating awareness among families with K-12 students through integrated marketing campaigns that include offline and digital media, as well as web assets. These campaigns are continuously optimized using data analytics and market research. In addition, the marketing team assists in enhancing the onboarding experience of new students to online schooling.
 Operations
 The physical learning kits that accompany our online lessons are an essential component of many of our courses. A student enrolling in one of our courses may receive multiple textbooks, art supplies, laboratory supplies (e.g. microscopes and scales) and other reference materials designed to enhance the learning experience. We package these books and materials into course‑specific learning kits. Because each student’s curriculum is customized, the combination of kits for each student must also be customized. 
 Over our 17 years of operation, we believe that we have gained significant experience in the sourcing, assembly and delivery of school supplies and materials. We have developed strong relationships with partners allowing us to source goods at favorable price, quality and service levels. Our fulfillment partner stores our inventory, assembles our learning kits and ships the kits to students. We have invested in systems, including our Order Management System, to automatically translate the curriculum selected by each enrolled student into an order to build the corresponding individualized learning kit. As a result, we believe we have an end‑to‑end warehousing and fulfillment operation that will cost‑effectively scale as the business grows in scope and complexity.
 For many of our virtual and blended public school customers, we attempt to reclaim any materials that could be cost‑effectively re‑utilized in the next school year. These items, once returned to our fulfillment centers, are refurbished and included in future learning kits. This reclamation process allows us to maintain lower materials costs. Our fulfillment activities are highly seasonal, and are centered on the start of school in August or September. Accordingly, approximately 

 
  22

 
77% of our annual materials inventory is received between March and June and approximately 73% of shipments to customers occur between June and September. In order to ensure that students in virtual and blended public schools have access to our OLS, we often provide students with a computer, where applicable or required and all necessary support. We source computers and ship them to students when they enroll and reclaim the computers upon termination of their enrollment or withdrawal from the school in which they are enrolled.
 Technology
 Our online learning systems, along with our back office support systems, are built on our proprietary Service Oriented Architecture (“SOA”) to ensure high availability and redundancy. The flexibility and security enabled by our SOA are the core principles of our systems’ foundation.
 Service Oriented Architecture. All of our systems leverage our SOA that is built on top of proven Enterprise Technologies. The SOA allows us to develop iterative solutions expeditiously to meet both present and future market needs. Our high availability and scalability are also facilitated by this architecture. The SOA also enables integration with third‑party solutions in our platform with ease and efficiency.
 Availability and Redundancy. Our SOA allows for primary and secondary equipment to be utilized at all network and application tiers. Each application layer is load balanced across multiple servers, which, along with our network management capabilities, allows for additional hardware to be inserted into our network providing us with optimal scalability and availability as evidenced by our typically greater than 99% uptime over a growing user base. We regularly backup critical data and store this backup data at an offsite location.
 Cybersecurity. Our cybersecurity measures and policies include dividing application layers into multiple zones controlled by firewall technology. Sensitive communications are encrypted between client and server and our server‑to‑server accessibility is strictly controlled and monitored. We also have engaged an outside firm to assist with traffic that may target our services and systems. We protect sensitive information and meet regulatory and contractual commitments through policy and control governance that is validated on a semi‑annual basis. We maintain a layered security architecture and regularly retain third parties to test our networks, servers and applications for vulnerabilities. We manage a business‑centric information security program that is tailored for our constantly changing IT compliance and information security threat landscape. 
 Physical Infrastructure. We utilize leading vendors to provide a foundation for our SOA. Our systems are housed offsite in data centers that provide a robust, redundant network backbone, power and geographically separated disaster recovery. Our second data center, geographically separated from our primary center, operates as a ready business continuity site with secured, near‑real time data replication from our primary data center. We routinely monitor our physical infrastructure for security, availability and performance.
 Other Information
 Intellectual Property
 We continue to invest in our intellectual property as we develop more courses for new grades and expand into adjacent education markets, both in the United States and overseas. Through acquisitions, we have also acquired curriculum, patents and trademarks that expand our portfolio of educational products and services. We continue to add features and tools to our proprietary learning platform and support systems to assist teachers and students and improve educational outcomes, such as adaptive learning technologies. These intellectual property assets are critical to our success and we avail ourselves of the full protections provided under the patent, copyright, trademark and trade secrets laws. We also routinely utilize confidentiality and licensing agreements with our employees, the virtual and blended public schools, traditional schools, school districts and private schools that we serve, individual consumers, contractors and other businesses and persons with which we have commercial relationships.
 Our patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending applications directed towards various aspects of our educational products and offerings. In particular, the first family of patent applications we filed in the U.S. and in foreign countries was directed towards the first generation of our system and method of virtual schooling and includes two issued patents. Further, two U.S. patents were issued for our systems and methods of online foreign language instruction. We 

 
  23

 
have been issued patents in the United States and in a foreign country for aspects of the second generation of our virtual school application.
 We own and register the copyrights to the lessons contained in the courses that comprise our proprietary curriculum. We also have obtained federal and state registrations for numerous trademarks that are related to our offerings and we have applied to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register certain new trademarks. As a result of the acquisitions we have made, we also own U.S. and foreign trademarks and a portfolio of domain names.
 We grant licenses to individuals to use our software and access our online learning systems. Similarly, schools are granted licenses to utilize our online learning systems and to access TotalView and our other systems. These licenses are intended to protect our ownership and the confidentiality of the embedded information and technology contained in our software and systems. We also own many of the trademarks and service marks that we use as part of the student recruitment and branding services we provide to schools. Those marks are licensed to the schools for use during the term of the products and services agreements.
 Our employees, contractors and other parties with access to our confidential information sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately 4,750 employees, including approximately 2,500 teachers. Substantially all of these employees are located in the United States. In addition, there are approximately 2,200 teachers who are employed by virtual or blended public schools that we manage under turn‑key solution contracts with those schools but are not direct employees of K12. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement; however, certain managed public schools we serve employ unionized teachers. We believe that our employee relations are good. Corporate Information
 Our principal executive office is located at 2300 Corporate Park Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20171 and our telephone number is (703) 483‑7000. Our website address is www.K12.com.

Information contained on our website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. REGULATION
 We and the virtual and blended public schools that we serve are subject to regulation by and laws of each of the states in which we operate. The state laws and regulations that impact our business are primarily those that authorize or restrict our ability to operate these schools, as well as the applicable funding mechanisms for the schools. To the extent these schools receive federal funds, such as through a grant program or financial support dedicated for the education of low‑income families, these schools also become subject to additional federal regulation.
 State Laws Authorizing or Restricting Virtual and Blended Public Schools. The authority to operate a virtual or blended public school is dependent on the laws and regulations of each state. Laws and regulations vary significantly from one state to the next and are constantly evolving. In states that have implemented specific legislation to support virtual and blended public schools, the schools are able to operate under these statutes. Other states provide for virtual and blended public schools under existing public charter school legislation or provide that school districts and/or state education agencies may authorize them. Some states do not currently have legislation that provides for virtual and blended public 

 
  24

 
schools or have requirements that effectively prohibit such schools and, as a result, may require new legislation before virtual and blended public schools can open in the state. 
 Obtaining new legislation in the remaining states where we do not have virtual and blended public schools can be a protracted and uncertain process. When determining whether to pursue expansion into new states in which the laws are ambiguous, we research the relevant legislation and policy climate and then make an assessment of the perceived likelihood of success before deciding to commit resources. Specifically, we take into account numerous factors including, but not limited to, the regulations of the state educational authorities, whether the overall policy environment is amenable to school choice, whether current funding levels for virtual school and blended schools enrollments are adequate and accessible, and the presence of non‑profit and for‑profit competitors in the state.
 State Laws and Regulations Applicable to Virtual and Blended Public Schools. Virtual and blended public schools that purchase our curriculum and management services are often governed and overseen by a non‑profit or a local or state education agency, such as an independent public charter school board, local school district or state education authority. We generally receive funds for products and services rendered to operate virtual public schools or blended schools under detailed service agreements with that governing authority. Virtual and blended public schools are typically funded by state or local governments on a per student basis. A virtual or blended public school that fails to comply with the state laws and regulations applicable to it may be required to repay these funds and could become ineligible for receipt of future state funds.
 To be eligible for state funding, some states require that virtual and blended public schools be organized as not‑for‑profit charters exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The schools must then be organized exclusively for charitable educational purposes, and not for the benefit of private, for‑profit management companies. The board or governing authority of the not‑for‑profit virtual or blended public school must retain ultimate accountability and control for the school’s operations to retain its tax‑exempt status. It may not delegate its responsibility and accountability for the school’s operations. Our service agreements with these virtual and blended public schools are therefore structured to ensure the full independence of the not‑for‑profit board and preserve its arms‑length ability to exercise its fiduciary obligations to operate a virtual or blended public school.
 Laws and regulations affect many aspects of operating a virtual or blended public school. They can dictate the content and sequence of the curriculum, the methods for counting student enrollments for funding purposes, graduation requirements, use of approved textbooks, the length of the school year and the school day, the accessibility of curriculum and technology to students with disabilities, teacher to student ratios, specific credentialing of teachers and administrators, the assessment of student performance and any accountability requirements. In addition, a virtual or blended public school may be obligated to comply with states’ requirements to offer programs for specific populations, such as students at risk of dropping out of school, advanced and talented students, non‑English speaking students, pre‑kindergarten students and students with disabilities. Tutoring services and the use of technology may also be regulated. Other state laws and regulations may affect the school’s compulsory attendance requirements, treatment of absences and make‑up work, and access by parents to student records and teaching and testing materials.
 In addition to federal laws protecting the privacy of student education records, a growing number of states are enacting laws to protect the privacy of student data and to guard against its misuse. As a general matter these laws are designed to prevent third‑party vendors to schools from using student data for non‑educational purposes and ensuring the security of personally identifiable information. In addition, virtual or blended public schools may have to comply with state requirements that school campuses report various types of data as performance indicators of the success of the program.
 States have laws and regulations concerning certification, training, experience and continued professional development of teachers and staff with which a virtual or blended public school may be required to comply. There are also numerous laws pertaining to employee salaries and benefits, statewide teacher retirement systems, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits and matters related to employment agreements and procedures for termination of school employees. A virtual or blended public school must also comply with requirements for performing criminal background checks on school staff, reporting criminal activity by school staff and reporting suspected child abuse.
 As with any public school, virtual and blended public schools must comply with state laws and regulations applicable to governmental entities, such as open meetings or sunshine laws, which may require the board of trustees of a virtual or blended public school to provide advance public notice of and hold its meetings open to the public unless an 

 
  25

 
exception in the law allows an executive session. Failure to comply with these requirements may lead to personal civil and/or criminal penalties for board members or officers or the invalidation of actions taken during meetings that were not properly noticed and open to the public. Virtual and blended public schools must also comply with public information or open records laws, which require them to make school records available for public inspection, review and copying unless a specific exemption in the law applies. Additionally, laws pertaining to records privacy and retention and to standards for maintenance of records apply to virtual and blended public schools.
 Other types of regulation applicable to virtual and blended public schools include restrictions on the use of public funds, the types of investments made with public funds, the collection of and use of student fees, accounting and financial management, and marketing practices.
 There remains uncertainty about the extent to which virtual and blended public schools we serve may be required to comply with state laws and regulations applicable to traditional public schools because the concept of virtual and blended public schools is still evolving, especially as technology advances. Although we receive state funds indirectly, according to the terms of each service agreement with the local public school entity, our receipt of state funds subjects us to extensive state regulation and scrutiny. States routinely conduct audits of these schools, to verify enrollment, attendance, information technology security, fiscal accountability, special education services and other regulatory issues. While we may believe that a virtual public school or blended school we serve is compliant with state law, an agency’s different interpretation of law in a particular state, or the application of facts to such law, could result in findings of non‑compliance, potentially affecting future funding or repayment of past funding.
 Regulations Restricting Virtual and Blended Public School Growth and Funding. As a public schooling alternative, some state and regulatory authorities have elected to proceed cautiously with virtual and blended public schools while providing opportunities for families seeking this alternative. Statutes, regulations or policies that control the growth of virtual and blended public schools range from setting caps on statewide student enrollments, to prescribing the number of schools in a state, to limiting the percentage of time students may receive instruction online. Funding regulations can also have this effect.
 Statutes or regulations that hinder our ability to serve certain jurisdictions include: restrictions on student eligibility, such as mandating attendance at a traditional public school prior to enrolling in a virtual or blended public school; caps on the total number of students in a virtual or blended public school; restrictions on grade levels served; geographic limitations on enrollments; fixing the percentage of per pupil funding that must be paid to teachers; state‑specific curriculum requirements; and limits on the number of charters that can be granted in a state.
 Funding regulations for virtual public schools and blended schools can take a variety of forms. These regulations include: (i) attendance—some state daily attendance rules were designed for traditional classroom procedures, and applying them to track daily attendance and truancy in an online setting can cause disputes to arise over interpretation and funding; (ii) enrollment eligibility—some states place restrictions on the students seeking to enroll in virtual and blended public schools, resulting in lower aggregate funding levels; (iii) teacher contact time—some states have regulations that specify minimum levels of teacher‑student face‑to‑face time; and (iv) completion of course work. These regulations can create logistical challenges for statewide virtual and blended public schools, reduce funding and eliminate some of the economic, academic and technological advantages of virtual learning.
 Federal and State Grants. We have worked with some entities to secure public and grant funding that flows to virtual and blended public schools that we serve. These grants are awarded to the not‑for‑profit entity that holds the charter of the virtual or blended public school on a competitive basis in some instances and on an entitlement basis in other instances. Grants awarded to public schools and programs—whether by a federal or state agency or nongovernmental organization—often include reporting requirements, procedures and obligations.
 Foreign Laws and Regulations. Schools we operate in other countries are subject to local laws and regulations. We oversee and rely on the administrators in each school on a continuous basis and seek the advice of local legal and regulatory experts as‑needed.
 Federal Laws Applicable to Virtual Public Schools and Blended Schools
 Five primary federal laws are directly applicable to the day‑to‑day provision of educational services we provide to virtual and blended public schools:

 
  26

 

 Every Student Succeeds Act (“ESSA”).  The Every Student Succeeds Act, which took effect on August 2, 2016  and is authorized through 2020, represents a major change in federal education law by shifting education policy decision making back to the states and by providing most funding through block grants. Of particular significance to the Company is that the states will now have the discretion to develop and design their own accountability systems. In addition, states have been given the authority to adopt different types of annual accountability frameworks for school performance, including proficiency and growth standards for all students and subgroups. The ESSA makes clear that the U.S. Department of Education has a more limited role to impose federal mandates, direction or control over the authority given to the states. Finally, there are provisions that provide significant grants to support the start-up of new charter schools with priority to states that serve at‑risk students through dropout prevention and recovery and other grants to support language instruction for English language learners and immigrant students.  Notwithstanding these federal limitations, states are still required under ESSA to test students in reading or language arts and math annually in grades 3-8 and once in grades 10-12, and in science once in each of the following grade spans: 3-5, 6-9 and 10-12. States have until September 2017 to submit plans to the U.S. Department of Education to demonstrate compliance with ESSA.
 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”). The IDEA is implemented through regulations governing every aspect of the special education of a child with one or more of the specific disabilities listed in the Act. The IDEA created a responsibility on the part of a school to identify students who may qualify under the IDEA and to perform periodic assessments to determine the students’ needs for services. A student who qualifies for services under the IDEA must have in place an individual education plan, which must be updated at least annually, created by a team consisting of school personnel, the student, and the parent. This plan must be implemented in a setting where the child with a disability is educated with non‑disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. The Act provides the student and parents with numerous due process rights relating to the student’s program and education, including the right to seek mediation of disputes and make complaints to the state education agency. The schools we manage are responsible for ensuring the requirements of this Act are met. The virtual public schools and blended schools are required to comply with certain requirements in the Act concerning teacher certification and training. We, the virtual public school or the blended school could be required to provide additional staff, related services and supplemental aids and services at our own cost to comply with the requirement to provide a free appropriate public education to each child covered under the IDEA. If we fail to meet this requirement, we, the virtual public school or blended school could lose federal funding and could be liable for compensatory educational services, reimbursement to the parent for educational service the parent provided and payment of the parent’s attorney’s fees.
 The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. A virtual public school or blended school receiving federal funds is subject to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 504”) insofar as the regulations implementing the Act govern the education of students with disabilities as well as personnel and parents. Section 504 prohibits discrimination against a person on the basis of disability in any program receiving federal financial assistance if the person is otherwise qualified to participate in or receive benefit from the program. Students with disabilities not specifically listed in the IDEA may be entitled to specialized instruction or related services pursuant to Section 504 if their disability substantially limits a major life activity. Beginning in 2011, the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) of the United States Department of Education interpreted both Section 504 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act to apply to elementary and secondary schools and to require that students with disabilities be afforded substantially equivalent ease of use as students without disabilities. As applied to online public schools, such “web accessibility” requires technical capabilities similar to those applied to procurements of information technology by the federal government under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (“Section 508”) or standards adopted by the world‑wide web consortium. If a school fails to comply with the requirements and the procedural safeguards of Section 504, it may lose federal funds even though these funds flow indirectly to the school through a local board. In the case of bad faith or intentional wrongdoing, some courts have awarded monetary damages to prevailing parties in Section 504 lawsuits. In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting additional public comments on the appropriate standard for determining Web accessibility compliance under Section 508 and Title II of the ADA and allowed two years for covered entities to come into full compliance after issuance of its final rules.
 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Virtual public schools and blended schools are also subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) which protects the privacy of a student’s educational records and generally prohibits a school from disclosing a student’s records to a third party without the parent’s prior consent. The law also gives parents certain procedural rights with respect to their minor children’s education records. A school’s failure to comply with this law may result in termination of its eligibility to receive federal education funds.

 
  27

 

 Communications Decency Act. The Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“CDA”) provides protection for online service providers against legal action being taken against them because of certain actions of others. For example, the CDA states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any data given by another provider of information content. Further, Section 230 of the CDA grants interactive online services of all types, broad immunity from tort liability so long as the information at issue is provided or posted by a third party. As part of our technology services offering, we provide an online school platform on which teachers and students may communicate. We also conduct live classroom sessions using Internet‑based collaboration software and we may offer certain online community platforms for students and parents. While the CDA affords us with some protection from liability associated with the interactive online services we offer, there are exceptions to the CDA that could result in successful actions against us that give rise to financial liability.
 Other Federal Laws. Other federal laws also apply to virtual managed schools, in some cases depending on the demographics associated with a school. For example, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been deemed to apply to ELL Students, as further defined in the joint guidance issued by the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education in January 2015. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 also applies, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in education programs, activities and employment, applies to all schools that receive federal funds. There are also other federal laws and regulations that affect other aspects of our business such as the identify theft rules adopted by the Federal Trade Commission and for which we have adopted policies to ensure compliance. The Children’s Internet Protection Act requires that school districts that receive certain types of federal funding must ensure that they have technology which blocks or filters certain material from being accessed through the Internet. We have developed procedures by which computers that we ship to students meet this requirement. If we fail to comply with these and other federal laws, we could be determined ineligible to receive funds from federal programs or face penalties.
