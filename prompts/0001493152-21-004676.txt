Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. is a global medical technology company focused on the design, development, and commercialization of a comprehensive portfolio of orthobiologics and spinal implant fixation systems to facilitate spinal fusion in complex spine, deformity, and degenerative procedures. Our products are used by orthopedic spine surgeons and neurosurgeons to treat a variety of spinal disorders in the cervical, thoracolumbar, and interbody spine.
 
We promote and sell our products in the United States through independent distributors and stocking agents, supported by direct employees. We have an extensive distribution channel of commissioned independent agents and stocking agents in the United States representing some or all of our products. We also maintain a national accounts program to enable our agents to gain access to independent health delivery network hospitals and through group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”). We have biologics contracts with major GPOs, as well as extensive access to integrated delivery networks (“IDNs”) across the United States for both our biologics and spine hardware products. We promote and sell our products internationally through distribution partners in Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, and certain Pacific region countries.
 
Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused business closures, severe travel restrictions and implementation of social distancing measures. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and other medical facilities cancelled or deferred elective procedures, diverted resources to patients suffering from infections and limited access for non-patients, including our direct and indirect sales representatives. Our response since the onset of COVID-19 has been undertaken with the objective of positioning Xtant for long-term success by:
 

● | Implementing a series of cost-saving actions intended to preserve capital and restructure our operations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Identifying and implementing specific operational procedural changes to return yields on biological products to realign with our mission of, “Honoring the gift of donation by allowing our patients to live as full a life as possible”; 
● | Re-engineering business processes in bioprocessing and inventory management systems to support current and future commercial activities; and 
● | Restructuring our credit facility to dramatically reduce the amount of our indebtedness and cost to service our debt, which should make it easier for us to refinance or replace this debt in the future, as well as facilitate easier access to capital markets for investment in our growth initiatives.

Industry and Market Overview
 
The orthopedic biomaterials market consists of materials that are organic, inorganic or synthetic in nature. These materials are implanted or applied in or near the indicated bone to aid in healing, encourage bone tissue augmentation, compensate in areas where bone tissue is depleted and restore structure to allow for repair. These materials are often used as substitutes to autograft materials, which are taken from a harvest site in the patient to patch or repair the wounded or unhealthy site.
 
Fixation is often instrumental in allowing the body to heal and regenerate tissue. It provides the constructive support necessary for reestablishing stability, by immobilizing the regenerative site, and relieving stress. Fixation can also help hold the biomaterial in place in order to achieve a better outcome. Examples of fixation products can include, but are not limited to, plates, screws, pins, rods, spacers, and staples, and may be made from various metals and polymer materials.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely upon patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others.
 
We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods. As a condition of employment, we generally require employees to execute an agreement relating to the confidential nature of and company ownership of proprietary information and assigning intellectual property rights to us. We generally require confidentiality agreements with vendors, consultants, and others who may have access to proprietary information. We generally limit access to our facilities and review the release of company information in advance of public disclosure. There can be no assurances, however, that confidentiality agreements with employees, vendors, and consultants will not be breached, adequate remedies for any breach would be available, or competitors will not discover or independently develop our trade secrets. Litigation also may be necessary to protect trade secrets or techniques we own.
 
Patents
 
Although we believe that, in the aggregate, our patents are valuable, and patent protection is beneficial to our business and competitive positioning, our patent protection will not necessarily deter or prevent competitors from attempting to develop similar products. There can be no assurances that our patents will provide competitive advantages for our products or that competitors will not challenge or circumvent these rights. In addition, there can be no assurances that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) or foreign patent offices will issue any of our pending patent applications. The USPTO and foreign patent offices may deny or require a significant narrowing of the claims in our pending patent applications and the patents issuing from such applications. Any patents issuing from the pending patent applications may not provide us with significant commercial protection. We could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the USPTO or foreign patent offices, including opposition and other post-grant proceedings. These proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the patentability, priority of our inventions, and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents. Additionally, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as the laws in the United States or at all.
 
While we do not believe that any of our products infringe any valid claims of patents or other proprietary rights held by others, we have an outstanding claim of patent infringement litigation which we are analyzing. In addition, we were recently subject to patent infringement litigation that we settled in February 2020. There can be no assurances that we do not infringe any patents or other proprietary rights. If our products were found to infringe any proprietary right of another party, we could be required to pay significant damages, license fees or royalties to such party and/or cease production, marketing, and distribution of those products. Litigation also may be necessary to defend infringement claims of third parties or to enforce patent rights we hold or to protect trade secrets or techniques we own.
 
Our policy is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries when we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. As of December 31, 2020, our fixation patent portfolio includes 51 issued patents globally, and our biologics patent portfolio includes 19 issued patents globally and 4 patent applications pending. We expect that additional patent applications will be filed and prosecuted as inventions are discovered, technological improvements and processes are developed, and specific applications are identified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain final approval of any patents.
 
Trademarks
 
We have registered, and continue to seek registration, of trademarks and continuously monitor and aggressively pursue users of names and marks that potentially infringe upon our registered trademarks. We currently own the following registered trademarks: OsteoSponge®, OsteoVive®, OsteoWrap®, OsteoLock®, BacFast®, OsteoSelect®, Elutia®, OsteoSTX®, hMatrix®, 3Demin®, BACTERINSE®, and Circle of Life®. Under the X-spine name, we own the following registered trademarks: SILEX®, X-SPINE®, IRIX®, CAPLESS®, CERTEX®, CALIX®, H-GRAFT®, SPIDER, X90®, HYDRAGRAFT®, BUTREX®, FORTEX®, AXLE®, FIXCET®, XTANT®, Capless® and X-spine’s square design logo.

Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Rights
 
To safeguard our proprietary knowledge and technology, we rely upon trade secret protection and non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third-party collaboration partners with access to our confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will adequately protect against the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or that third parties will not be able to independently develop similar technology. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any agreements concerning confidentiality and non-disclosure will not be breached, or if breached, that we will have an adequate remedy to protect us against losses. Although we believe our proprietary technology has value, because of rapid technological changes in the medical industry, we also believe that proprietary protection is of less significance than factors such as the intrinsic knowledge and experience of our management, advisory board, consultants and personnel and their ability to identify unmet market needs and to create, invent, develop and market innovative and differentiated products.
Government Regulation
 
We are registered with the U.S Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) as a manufacturer of human cellular and tissue products (“HCT/Ps”) as well as medical devices, and we are an accredited member in good standing of the American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”). We meet all licensing requirements for the distribution of HCT/Ps in states with licensing requirements, including Florida, California, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Oregon, and New York. Our industry is highly regulated, and we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or our customers.
 
Our fixation products and instrumentation systems are regulated as medical devices and therefore are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, as well as by other domestic and international regulatory bodies. These regulations govern multiple activities that Xtant and our suppliers, licensors and partners perform and will continue to perform. These regulated activities include product design and development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, safety, premarket clearance, advertising and promotion, product marketing, sales and distribution, post-market surveillance and post-market adverse event reporting. All products currently marketed by Xtant are regulated as HCT/Ps and/or have received 510(k) clearances.
 
Human Tissue
 
Human tissue products have been regulated by the FDA since 1993. These regulations are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. Among other things, the regulations require that companies that recover, process, store, label, package or distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. In addition, regulations provide criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the “Donor Eligibility” rule. Regulations also govern the processing and distribution of the tissues and are often referred to as the “Current Good Tissue Practices” (“cGTP”) regulations.
 
An HCT/P is regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and 21 CFR Part 1271 if it meets the following four criteria:
 

1) The HCT/P is minimally manipulated; 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) The HCT/P is intended for homologous use only; 
3) The manufacture of the HCT/P does not involve the combination of the cells or tissues with another article (with limited exceptions); and 
4) The HCT/P does not have a systemic effect and is not dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function; or the HCT/P has a systemic effect or is dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function and: is for autologous use; is for allogeneic use in a first-degree or second-degree blood relative; or is for reproductive use. 


8
-


Several of our products, including OsteoSponge and OsteoWrap, are regulated as HCT/Ps because they meet these four criteria. The FDA’s Tissue Reference Group confirmed this in non-binding recommendations provided to us.
 
Products that are regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA and 21 CFR Part 1271 are subject to the following regulatory requirements:
 

● | Registration and Listing: Establishments that engage in the manufacture of HCT/Ps are required to register annually with the FDA and list their HCT/Ps. New establishments are required to register and list their HCT/Ps within 5 days after beginning operations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Donor Eligibility: HCT/P establishments must screen donors for risk factors for, and clinical evidence of, relevant communicable disease agents and diseases and communicable disease risks associated with xenotransplantation, as well as test donors for relevant communicable disease agents. 
● | Good Tissue Practices: HCT/P establishments must comport with the regulatory requirements for preventing the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable disease. These regulations cover facilities, environmental control, equipment, supplies and reagents, recovery, processing and process controls, labeling controls, storage, receipt, predistribution shipment, and distribution of HCT/Ps. 
● | Adverse Reaction Reporting: Establishments are required to investigate any adverse reaction involving a communicable disease related to an HCT/P that the manufacturer made available for distribution. The regulatory criteria call for reporting such adverse reactions involving a communicable disease if it is fatal, life-threatening, results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or necessitates medical or surgical intervention, including hospitalization. 
● | Inspections: The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. HCT/P manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the cGTP regulations. 
● | Violative Product: Upon an FDA finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an HCT/P is a violative HCT/P because it was manufactured in violation of applicable regulations; the HCT/P is infected or contaminated so as to be a source of dangerous infection to humans; or an establishment is in violation of applicable regulations, the FDA may issue an order that the HCT/Ps be recalled, destroyed or retained, take possession of and/or destroy the violative HCT/Ps, or serve upon the establishment an order to cease manufacturing. 

 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions such as warning or untitled letters, injunctions, or other action.
 
There are many HCT/P products that do not meet the criteria to be classified solely under Section 361 of the PHSA and 21 CFR Part 1271 and therefore must undergo regulatory review and licensure by the FDA. The approval process for a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) includes a rigorous review of the safety and efficacy of the biological product. Successful applications typically require testing and validation through a series of clinical and non-clinical studies taking place over multiple years of product development. We refer to all of our HCT/P products as biologics.
 
Medical Devices
 
A medical device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component part, or accessory which is: (i) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them; (ii) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or (iii) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve any of its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health governs the clearance and approval of conventional medical devices, such as our spinal hardware, as well as some of the HCT/Ps that are also regulated as medical devices, such as our OsteoSelect DBM putty.

In the United States, medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending pre-market approval applications (“PMAs”), issuance of warning letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
 
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the risk associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class III devices must typically be approved by the FDA before they are marketed.
 
Most Class I devices and a minority of Class II devices are completely exempt from premarket review by the FDA. Most Class II devices and a minority of Class I devices require 510(k) clearance. Devices that pose the highest risk, including life sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a “pre-amendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which PMA applications are not required, are placed in Class III requiring PMA approval. A novel device is placed in Class III by default, but it may be eligible to be placed in Class I or Class II via “de novo” classification if it can be shown to pose only low to moderate risk with appropriate regulatory controls.
 
The PMA approval pathway requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. The 510(k) clearance pathway is much less burdensome and time-consuming than the PMA approval pathway. The de novo pathway has an enhanced burden compared to the 510(k) clearance pathway, but is much less burdensome than a PMA approval process.
 
Under the 510(k) clearance pathway, the applicant must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device, Class II de novo device, or a pre-amendment device (unless the FDA has issued a regulation calling for PMA applications for this device type). To be substantially equivalent, the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and be shown to be equally safe and effective and not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device.
 
After the FDA accepts the 510(k) premarket notification, it begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, typically ranging from three to nine months or more, and clearance is never assured. The FDA’s 510(k) review generally compares a proposed device to a predicate device with respect to intended use and technology. The information necessary to show substantial equivalence will depend on the differences between the proposed device and the predicate device, which may include bench, animal, and/or clinical studies. The discussion of what data is needed is sometimes conducted in a voluntary process called the Pre-Submission process whereby companies meet with the FDA to discuss the data needed for clearance.
 
If the FDA finds the applicant’s device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, it will send a letter to the applicant stating that fact. This allows the applicant’s device to be commercially distributed in the United States. Otherwise, the applicant must fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process.
 

10
--


After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require reclassification through the de novo process or a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval. The FDA can also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval is obtained.
 
Another procedure for obtaining marketing authorization for a medical device is the “de novo classification” procedure. Devices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III, regardless of the level of risk they pose. Additionally, in response to a 510(k) premarket notification, if the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 
Generally, a de novo application contains a device description, indications for use statement, proposed labeling, data/performance testing (e.g., bench testing and/or clinical study data), the proposed classification, and a risk/benefit analysis. The risk/benefit analysis is the key element of a de novo petition and typically includes a summary of the benefits of the device, a summary of the known and potential risks, any risk mitigations, and an explanation of whether the benefits outweigh the risks. The applicant must also outline special controls, which can include data and labeling requirements that subsequent applicants under the new device classification regulation must follow to obtain a 510(k) clearance.
 
The timing for review of a de novo application is less certain than a 510(k). As a practical matter, de novo marketing authorization often ranges from a year or more, and marketing authorization is never assured. If the FDA authorizes the de novo petition, the device may be legally marketed and used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions. If the de novo application is denied, the device remains in Class III and a PMA approval may be required before the device may be legally marketed in the United States.
 
The advantage of the de novo classification is that it generally requires less data than a PMA. The disadvantage is that it may require more data than a 510(k) and most often will include human clinical data. A request for de novo classification also has a longer review time. The FDA is increasingly moving devices with slightly different proposed indication statements or different technological features off the 510(k) path and onto the de novo path, resulting in more time and expense for the company.
 
A device not eligible for 510(k) clearance or de novo classification must follow the PMA approval pathway, which requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. The cost of preparing and submitting a PMA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most PMAs is additionally subject to a substantial annually adjusted application user fee. Satisfaction of FDA PMA requirements typically takes years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the device or disease. In the future, Xtant may decide to strategically commercialize products in the United States that would require a PMA, but there are no plans to do so at the present time.
 
A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and also detailed information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. There is sometimes advisory panel review of the clinical data. The FDA typically conducts a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer’s facilities and may also inspect the clinical trial documentation. The FDA will not approve the device unless compliance is shown with Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. During the review period, the FDA may also request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA.
 
By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. If its evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter. An approvable letter usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure a final approval of the PMA application. When and if these conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in this approval letter, if any. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or the relevant manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA application or issue a not approvable letter.

Even after approval of a PMA, new PMA applications or PMA supplements may also be required for modifications to any approved device, including modifications to the manufacturing processes, device labeling and device design, based on the findings of post-approval studies. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 
After a medical device enters commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | The FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of devices for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
● | Advertising and promotion requirements; 
● | Restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; 
● | The potential for new 510(k) clearances for certain modifications to previously 510(k) cleared devices; 
● | Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
● | Medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA their field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA; 
● | Recall requirements, including a mandatory recall, if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 
● | An order of repair, replacement or refund; 
● | Device tracking requirements; and 
● | Post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 

 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions such as: warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our devices; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing; the FDA’s refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearances, de novo classification, or premarket approvals of new devices, new intended uses or modifications to existing devices; the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export devices for sale in other countries; and withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo marketing authorization, or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and criminal prosecution.

International Regulation
 
Many foreign countries have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country or to obtain a CE Certificate of Conformity may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the related requirements may differ. Some third-world countries accept CE Certificates of Conformity or FDA clearance or approval as part of applications of approval for marketing of medical devices in their territory. Other countries, including Brazil, Canada, Australia and Japan, require separate regulatory filings.
 
In light of extensive new legislation in Europe, specifically the new European Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”), we ceased selling products in the European Union (“EU”) during the third quarter of 2020 after concluding that the cost to maintain our regulatory approvals and sell our products in the EU, especially in light of this extensive new legislation, exceeded the benefits of doing business there for Xtant. Our revenues from sales of our products in the EU during 2020 were only $0.2 million.
 
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
 
Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to Xtant’s business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or most other federally-funded healthcare programs. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal health care programs, such as by Medicare or Medicaid. The concerns that the Anti-Kickback Statute addresses are multiple, but primary among them are, first, that the federal government pays/reimburses health care providers for the true acquisition cost of goods and services provided to patients served by government programs. The government does not want, for example, health care providers obtaining manufacturer discounts which are not disclosed to the government on cost report forms submitted for reimbursement to the government. The government wants to be the beneficiary of such discounts. Second, for that reason, the government wants transparency in the billing process which discloses such discounts to the government. Third, the government does not want purchasing, prescription or referral decisions for medical devices biased by economics unrelated to the best choices for a patient.
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. Remunerative relationships with physicians in which manufacturers give health care providers gifts or pay for entertainment, sporting events, trips or other perquisites, may be viewed as an attempt to buy loyalty to the manufacturer’s products. A number of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by government programs as well as any third-party payors, including commercial insurers.
 
Further, federal legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively “PPACA”), among other things, clarified the intent requirements of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. Specifically, a person or entity can be found to have violated the statutes without actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA amended the Social Security Act to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. Recent amendments to the Federal False Claims Act provide that a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is also a violation of the Federal False Claims Act, subjecting healthcare entities to treble damages and mandatory penalties for each false claim or statement.

Additionally, the civil Federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The purpose of the Federal False Claims Act is to prevent manufacturers from causing or inducing inappropriate prescriptions leading to an inappropriate government reimbursement. It often comes into play where a manufacturer suggests or assists a health care provider to bill for an off-label, uncovered use. It also can occur when the reimbursement advice given by a manufacturer results in inappropriate reimbursement claims from “upcoding,” miscoding, “stretched” coding, the use of inappropriate modifiers or inappropriate care settings. These behaviors can result in the government paying for products or procedures that should not be reimbursed by the federal government. The manufacturer must be truthful and not misleading in the reimbursement advice it gives to customers.
 
Actions under the Federal False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the Federal False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the Federal False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare companies throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, as well as federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the Federal False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
 
The Federal False Claims Act amendments in 2009 and 2010 expanded the scope of the liability for health care entities generally to potentially reach violations of regulatory duties, such as good manufacturing practices. There have been large settlements in the life sciences arena related to FDA regulatory violations for promotional activities and good manufacturing practice.
 
Even in instances where a company may have no actual liability, the Federal False Claims Act private citizen provisions (qui tam) allow the filing of Federal False Claims Act actions under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the United States Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material even if the allegations are without merit.
 
Federal False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the health industry because the statute, as adjusted for inflation, provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, health care companies resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may awarded in litigation proceedings. They may be required, however, to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs to companies to ensure compliance.
 
The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians. Effective January 2021, device manufactures are also required to collect information on payments or transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives for reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) in 2022. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.” Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.

If a governmental authority were to conclude that Xtant is not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Xtant and its officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Our United States operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded United States corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in certain foreign jurisdictions.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Xtant’s currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in spinal and orthopedic surgery and if covered by third-party payors, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Accordingly, healthcare providers in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which Xtant products are used. Sales volumes and fees for Xtant products will continue to depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. Third-party payors perform analyses on new technologies to determine if they are medically necessary before providing coverage for them. These third-party payors may still deny reimbursement on covered technologies if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with the payor’s coverage policy. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products.
 
In the United States, a large percentage of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use Xtant products.
 
The overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will likely continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. Government or private third-party payors cannot be guaranteed to cover and reimburse the procedures using Xtant products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for Xtant products or the ability to sell them on a profitable basis.
 
Internationally, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary substantially from country to country and include single-payor, government-managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government managed systems exist side-by-side. Xtant’s ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using company products under the healthcare payment systems in such markets. A number of countries may require Xtant to gather additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for its products.
 
ISO Certification
 
Xtant is an International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certified organization. To obtain ISO 13485:2016 certification, an organization must demonstrate its ability to provide medical devices that consistently meet applicable customer and regulatory requirements. The primary objective of ISO 13485:2016 is to facilitate harmonized medical device regulatory requirements for quality management systems. All requirements of ISO 13485:2016 are specific to organizations providing medical devices, regardless of the type or size of the organization. The certification assures our customers and partners of our commitment to quality, and in the quality of our innovative products and processes. Additionally, we believe that our ISO 13485:2016 certification may offer new markets and business opportunities for our products in the global marketplace.

Corporate Information
 
We began operations in 1998 as a spin out of the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University, or the CBE, and incorporated as “Bacterin, Inc.” in the state of Montana in January 2000. Through a series of transactions and corporate events, we eventually became Bacterin International Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Bacterin”). Bacterin’s common stock traded on the NYSE Amex, now known as the NYSE American, under the ticker symbol “BONE.” On July 31, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of X-spine Systems, Inc. (“X-spine”) for approximately $60 million in cash, repayment of approximately $13 million of X-spine debt, and approximately 4.24 million shares (0.4 million shares post reverse split) of Xtant common stock. As a result of this transaction, X-spine became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bacterin International Holdings, Inc. At the close of business on July 31, 2015, we changed our corporate name to “Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc.” On August 6, 2015, we formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Xtant Medical, Inc., to facilitate the integration of Bacterin and X-spine. On October 15, 2015, our common stock began trading on the NYSE MKT, now known as the NYSE American, under the ticker symbol “XTNT.”
 
As a result of debt restructuring transactions completed during first quarter of 2018 and, more recently, during fourth quarter of 2020, as described in more detail under “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this Form 10-K, OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP (“Royalty Opportunities”), which is the sole holder of our outstanding indebtedness and lender under our credit facility, and ROS Acquisition Offshore LP (“ROS”), which are funds affiliated with OrbiMed Advisors LLC (“OrbiMed”), collectively own approximately 93.9% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020.
 
Our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility are located at 664 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714. Our telephone number is (406) 388-0480.
 
Controlled Company Status
 
We are a “controlled company” as defined in section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide because more than 50% of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by OrbiMed. As such, we are exempt from certain NYSE American rules requiring our Board of Directors to have a majority of independent members, a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors.
Available Information
 
We make available, free of charge and through our Internet website, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to any such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
