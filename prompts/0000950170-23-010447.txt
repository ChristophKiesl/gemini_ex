 Item 1. Business.
 Company Overview
Berkshire Grey is an Intelligent Enterprise Robotics (“IER”) company pioneering and delivering transformative AI-enabled robotic solutions that automate filling ecommerce orders for consumers or businesses, filling orders to resupply retail and grocery stores, and handling packages shipped to fill those orders. Our solutions transform supply chain operations and enable our customers to meet and exceed the demands of today’s connected consumers and businesses.
Our automation solutions are grounded in patented and proprietary technologies for robotic picking (each picking or unit handling), robotic sortation (sorting individual or small groups of items), movement and mobility (movement and storage of orders and goods), and system orchestration (which enables various intelligent subsystems to work together so that the right work is being done at the right time to meet our customer’s needs). We are a technology leader in robotics and AI automation with an intellectual property position buttressed by trade secrets supporting our technologies, and patents issued (198 U.S. and international) and pending (330 U.S. and international) in technologies including robotic picking, mobility, gripping, sensing and perception, general robot control, and differentiated supporting mechanisms. Our proprietary technologies enable us to offer holistic solutions that automate supply chain processes.
 We are not a component technology company nor are we a conventional systems integrator. Instead, we create products from the technologies we pioneer and develop, and then incorporate the products (product modules) into solutions, which are designed by us to meet customer ROI requirements and other performance metrics such as throughput and accuracy rates. Our technology delivers solutions addressing entire processes. Our customers do not need to purchase disparate components and attempt to combine them to achieve a full solution. Rather, we configure our solutions to automate entire process steps, which enables our customers to focus on the core of their business and creates attractive returns for them. We configure, install, commission and service our solutions for our customers. We also offer other professional services including system maintenance, system operation, and cloud-based monitoring and analytics. Since our solutions are modular, our customers can incrementally add to or change solutions, and we can incorporate other complementary technologies with our product

modules if desired. Customer projects can range from small to large installations in both brownfield and greenfield sites. We offer customers a range of purchase options including a robotics-as-a-service (“RaaS”) program that minimizes the up-front capital required when compared to conventional equipment purchase models.
We created these technologies, product modules, and solutions to support our customers at a time that supply chain operations are under increasing competitive pressures driven by changes in consumer expectations related to the growth of ecommerce. According to Statista Market Forecast, global ecommerce sales have grown significantly over the last decade, reaching approximately $3.6 trillion worldwide in 2022 and are expected to grow to approximately $6.6 trillion by 2027. Today’s consumers expect a wide variety of products to choose from, fast fulfillment, “free” shipping, limited or zero substitutes, and rapid delivery of goods. These consumer expectations put significant pressures on conventional supply chain operations, and it is these pressures that Berkshire Grey technologies help customers address.
Just as consumer expectations have changed, so too must the underlying supply chain technologies. Retailers, eCommerce companies, and logistics companies are being asked for increased performance at the same time that competitive pressures and labor availability issues are pronounced. The top three industry challenges, per a recent MHI study, are labor availability, increasing consumer demands, and increasing competitive intensity. With our AI-enabled technologies, product modules, and solutions, customers can better meet increasing consumer demands and maximize the functions of human workers and can do so competitively.
We believe that our addressable opportunity is large. Based on labor consuming approximately 65% of warehousing spend (F. Curtis Barry & Company) and total annual global warehouse spend of $350 billion (McKinsey), global annual spending on warehouse labor is approximately $230 billion, which represents manual labor associated with processes that can be automated with our technology. Further, according to Mordor Intelligence, $56 billion is spent annually on automated material handling equipment globally, representing additional market opportunity for our technology. These two factors together yield an addressable market for our technology, product modules, and solutions of approximately $280 billion annually.
 To date, most of our deployments have been with large, Fortune 50 companies, where our technology and solutions in production have achieved ROI targets and other performance metrics including throughput, accuracy, equipment effectiveness, and others. Our significant customers include Walmart, Target, FedEx, and TJX. Since inception, our customers have ordered approximately $265 million of systems from us, and as of December 31, 2022 we had orders of approximately $101 million in backlog that we expect to deliver and install during 2023 and early 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, Target Corporation, TJX, and FedEx, collectively comprised approximately 58% and 73% of our revenue, respectively.
Industry Background
According to Statista, there are approximately 25,500 warehouse facilities in North America, and it is these facilities that represent a critical link in the commerce supply chain. The flow of goods throughout a warehouse or logistics facility typically starts with receiving products in bulk and ends with items exiting the facility by shipping them either in different bulk bundles or as single units depending on the use case. When items arrive at the warehouse they are generally unpacked, counted, and stored. When an ecommerce or store order arrives, goods are picked to meet that order, which is typically in batches of several orders at a time. The batches of picked goods are then sorted into their respective orders, packed into boxes, and shipped to stores or individual consumers. The process is generally similar for ecommerce and retail replenishment purposes and there are similar processes in package sortation facilities used by logistics companies. Today, most facilities utilize human labor to perform these functions, which creates challenges for businesses when labor is scarce or when labor requirements fluctuate widely during peak seasons. The figure below illustrates the prototypical flow of goods within a warehouse



Over the last several years, there has been a significant evolution of the retail industry, driven by changing demographics and a shift from shopping in conventional brick-and-mortar stores to online to omnichannel commerce fulfillment. Fundamental changes in consumer buying behavior have substantially increased the complexities of supply chains, order fulfillment processes and logistics. Consumers are demanding greater product choice and availability, shorter delivery times, free delivery, and simpler return processes. Just as consumer behaviors have changed, the underlying supply chain operations and supporting technologies must change too. Ecommerce is a driving factor in these changes —even brick-and-mortar operations have had to adapt to online ordering of goods that are then picked up at the store.
Ecommerce is expected to continue to grow rapidly. The COVID-19 pandemic provided added energy to that growth and transition. Such growth requires businesses to innovate their supply chains. Large companies such as Amazon have accelerated this phenomenon. Amazon has grown into the largest ecommerce business in the United States and according to Statista, Amazon captured more than 37% of the ecommerce market in the United States in 2022. Amazon’s investment in automation has enabled this growth. By investing in automation, Amazon has been able to offer its customers a large selection of items with fast fulfillment at competitive cost levels. Disruption due to Amazon pertains not just to the consumer behaviors and expectations but to the underlying supply chain operations as well. Other retailers, ecommerce companies, grocers, and logistics companies that participate in the same markets must compete. At Berkshire Grey we offer these companies our technology, product modules, and solutions to support these needs.
Intelligent Enterprise Robotics (IER)
Berkshire Grey has the full portfolio of the capabilities that we believe are necessary to automate supply-chain and logistics enterprises today and enables a fully automated potential future. We call this set of capabilities Intelligent Enterprise Robotics, or IER, which we offer to our customers:
•Intelligence Software — software platforms which provide AI-enabled capabilities for individual modules, such as picking and mobility, and also provide system-level intelligence and orchestration of such robots to achieve overall system-wide performance. 
 •Automated Picking Platform — a platform capable of picking and packing individual items (“eaches”) or units of varying shapes, sizes, density, and material types, combined with thoughtful placement and the ability to meet specific requirements such as container density. 
 •Intelligent Mobile Robotic Platform — mobile robots which enable goods, bins, totes, cases, orders, boxes, etc., to be efficiently routed and moved utilizing multi-channel workflow sortation and aisle-friendly sequencing. 
 •Amplification Robotics & Automation — amplification and support robots which enact physical work and multiply the benefits of more complex subsystems such as picking and autonomous mobility. 
 •Cloud Analytics Platform — global data aggregation with multi-modal access providing analytics and reporting on a range of attributes including system performance and goods processed. 
 •Cloud AI — the AI that operates the various systems and subsystems must be cloud enabled so that they can operate from locations ranging from customer’s server rooms to remote hosted platforms. 
 •Holistic Sensing and Perception — systems must be capable of understanding the task world, in real time, and responding intelligently to items, situation, and context. This includes being able to understand thousands of SKUs and items of different types, understand boxes, bins, and totes, and even difficult to process items such as polybags, and to determine the state of the broader warehouse and supply chain around them. 
 •Enterprise APIs — systems must be able to integrate and communicate with a variety of warehouse management systems (WMS, WES, WCS). 
 •Wrapping & Incorporation of Third-Party and Other Legacy Systems — to enable enterprise transformation, systems and product modules must be designed to accommodate third-party systems, including robots, and legacy systems, e.g., existing AS/RS systems, where possible, and software must be able to interface with legacy systems as well. 
 •Brownfield and Greenfield Installation — systems and products must be amenable to both brownfield and greenfield installation. 


•Modularity, Flexibility, and Scalability — systems and products must be incrementally scalable and changeable to meet ever changing needs of the customers by adding new modules and robots with little disruption 
 •Dynamically Adjustable Performance — solutions must have the ability to change performance characteristics of individual modules or the overall system via software to accommodate changes as the enterprise grows and evolves. 
 •Mobile Data Access for Customers — systems must support mobile monitoring data and analytics so that customers can see and understand operations in real time even if offsite and be able to access this information via mobile devices. 
 In addition, we believe to best utilize IER capabilities, a company must offer customers a full spectrum of services. Our portfolio of services includes:
•Full Analysis & Design — we start with an analysis of the customer’s processes, product flows, goods handled, and even the physical layout of their existing systems, and use proprietary analysis methodologies and simulation to create solutions using our product modules and technological capabilities for our customers. 
 •Installation & Commissioning — we manufacture, install, and commission our systems. 
 •Professional Services — we offer a full suite of professional services from software updates, to maintenance, to remote monitoring, and even system operation. 
 Technology
While robots are physical and do physical work, algorithms and software produce much of the differentiated performance. Our intelligent algorithms and software differentiate Berkshire Grey systems from conventional robotic automation systems and enable us to automate tasks within warehouse and fulfillment center operations that have until recently not been automatable. For example, in manufacturing settings, conventional robotic tasks may include a robot painting a car. Here, the robots are generally executing plans by rote – plans that are simply programmed in advance by a human engineer. The car shape is known, the position of the car is known, and where the paint needs to be applied is known. In these cases, the capabilities are not about the robot being intelligent but are instead about the robot being a device which repeats these predefined steps on a predefined shape by rote and does so with high precision. In contrast, our robotic systems must self-determine movements and operations in real-time as they operate since many of the product attributes being presented are not known in advance. In addition, items that our robots need to process are typically not perfectly and consistently modeled or known, e.g., a small change in a label will make an item look slightly different. Where items must be placed in an outgoing box, for instance, is also situationally dependent e.g., considering what other items were ordered and what is already in the box are questions the robot must determine on its own as it works.
To produce the returns that our systems generate for our customers, we employ a wide variety of proprietary AI techniques to enable the robots to scan a bin or tote, identify its contents, decide where and how to pick up an item, plan motions to pick it up, plan motions to the outgoing receptacle, determine where in the outgoing receptacle to place the item, and then deposit the item in the determined location. To do this, our systems employ multiple AI subsystems for several key tasks, including perception and sensor interpretation, motion planning for where and how to pick up an item, and for tracking the system’s execution, and other critical aspects of the system’s operation. Our AI technologies also employ machine learning to improve performance over time. However, it is important to note that our systems are designed to meet the customers’ performance requirements out of the box, and improvements achieved though machine learning benefit the

customer over the long-term. We do not require months, years, or even minutes of teleoperation (also known as remote control of the robot by manual means) in advance to be effective.


To create product modules and solutions that perform useful work in an intelligent fashion, our AI algorithms and software are combined with differentiated hardware (which include our robotic pick cells, SpectrumGrippers, Hyperscanners, vision systems, mobile robots, among others) to form product modules as referenced in the figure below. Differentiated hardware is important to enable the AI and results in high-performance execution of the physical task. Patented grippers equipped with sensing and compliance in key areas, for instance, inform the AI and unlock its ability to perform the task well. Patented sensors enable the systems to see and process certain items, e.g., polybags which are notoriously difficult to handle and process. Our differentiated hardware is protected in part by 198 patents issued and 330 patents pending. The AI algorithms and software are trade secrets. These AI algorithms and software are combined with the differentiated hardware, along with other off-the-shelf components to create product modules. These product modules are generally manufactured by contract manufacturers, to our standards, which enables us to scale quickly. Solutions for our customers are then generated by analyzing customer goods, their processes and infrastructure, available physical space, etc., to determine which product modules are needed.



Product Modules
Our defined IER product module portfolio includes several offerings which are combined to create solutions for our customers. To create product modules and solutions that perform useful work in an intelligent fashion, our AI algorithms and software are combined with differentiated hardware to form product modules. Our product modules include:
Benefits Of Our Solutions
We believe our technology, product modules, and solutions provide material benefits including:
•Versatility — Our proprietary hardware and AI driven software enables our solutions to handle a broad range of SKUs, parcels and packaging of many types, shapes, colors, and patterns, including polybags, tubes, envelopes, mailers, odd-shaped boxes, containers, apparel, electronics, housewares, packaged food, childcare products, pet care items, health and beauty items, and other general merchandise. Our vision systems, AI and machine learning algorithms combined with haptics and gripping technology enable our solutions to handle wide ranges of products without the need for pre-programming or other manual processes to “teach” our robots. Further, our technology and product modules are industry agnostic — they can be applied broadly to businesses that fill orders or perform logistics. 
 •Speed and Accuracy — The need to process items faster and more accurately has become increasingly more important for retailers and logistics businesses. Our solutions help in both regards. For example, some of our solutions automate work equal to that performed by many people — amplifying what human staff can process. As our solutions increase in size, the amount of support provided by the automation increases generally with the potential to automate the work of substantially more workers, reducing reliance on labor, which is particularly valuable when labor is scarce. Our proprietary hardware and AI driven software also delivers highly accurate performance in the range of over 99%. 
 •Reliability — Our technology, product modules, and solutions are designed to be robust and to minimize downtime and require little human intervention when operating in production environments. Our solutions are designed to minimize single points of failure, and our system uptime often ranges over 99%. 
 •Flexibility and Scalability — Our product modules and solutions are designed to be modular both technically and physically. This means they can fit easily into different layouts within our customers’ facilities. Software combined with this modularity also means our product modules are incrementally changeable, scalable, and adaptable. As customers’ needs increase, additional modules or robots can be added as appropriate. 
 •Efficiency and Economic Benefits — Our solutions are used by Fortune 50 companies and other customers to improve their overall efficiency, reduce costs, increase processing accuracy and increase flexibility. Our 


customers have experienced improvements in operating efficiencies, labor costs, and throughput, resulting in meeting or exceeding ROI targets.
These benefits enable tangible competitive advantages for our customers, which we see as creating a flywheel of economic transformation for our customers. Generally, investment in our AI-enabled robotics and automation solutions provides customers with increased operational capabilities which allows them to offer more (choices, performance, etc.) to their customers, while doing so at a lower overall cost. Growing the topline through better customer satisfaction at a lower cost profile creates economic competitive advantage, and the cycle continues.


Our Market Opportunity
Historically, conventional automation was implemented primarily to reduce operating costs. In the last several years, the rapid growth of ecommerce has accelerated the need for distribution centers, logistics facilities and warehouses to adopt robotics and AI automation technologies to not only reduce operating costs, but to keep up with changes in consumer buying behavior and to remain competitive. We believe our technology, product modules, and solutions can be used in many businesses with order fulfillment, distribution and logistics facilities in a variety of industries, and our technology plays a key role in improving operational efficiencies, reducing labor dependencies, improving flexibility and increasing speed. We sell into a variety of market verticals, including ecommerce, retail, grocery, package handling, and third-party logistics. We market globally, and our deployments to date have been in the United States, Japan and Canada.
We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the large and expected rapid growth of the robotics and AI automation market and that only a limited amount of automation penetration has occurred to date. Based on labor consuming approximately 65% of warehousing spend (F. Curtis Barry & Company) and total annual global warehouse spend of $350 billion (McKinsey), global annual spending on warehouse labor is approximately $230 billion, which represents manual labor associated with processes that can be automated with our technology. Further, according to Mordor Intelligence, $56 billion is spent annually on automated material handling equipment globally, representing additional market opportunity for our technology. Therefore, our technology could provide solutions for an addressable market of over $280 billion annually.
Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our strategy for growth include the following:
Expand existing relationships with large strategic customers
To date, most of our deployments have been with large, Fortune 50 companies, where our technology and solutions in production have achieved targeted metrics including ROI. Our customers include Walmart, Target, FedEx, and TJX with solutions in operation or being installed. These customers have thousands of stores and hundreds of fulfillment and logistics centers in which our solutions can be implemented. Our goal is to continue our collaborative relationship with our large customers and to continue to help them add new levels of technology and automation throughout their network of operations.

The underlying modular and flexible product modules that we combine to create solutions, which can be deployed in both brownfield and greenfield situations, help to support this model.
Invest in sales and marketing to build a diverse, global customer base and expand geographically
We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts to rapidly expand our customer base. We currently focus on five market verticals with our technology: retail, ecommerce, grocery, package handling and 3PL. We believe that these market verticals provide the largest immediate opportunity for us due to the growth and challenges businesses face with the fundamental changes in consumer buying behavior, and we have developed our solutions to address these challenges. We believe nearly every ecommerce company, retailer, grocer, and logistics business is a potential customer.
Our deployments to date have been in the United States, Japan, and Canada. We expect to expand our installations with customers in other regions internationally, and we will continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts globally.
Continue to invest in technology
We intend to expand our engineering efforts to create increasingly more powerful artificial intelligence software platforms and differentiated hardware. This will continually increase product module and solution productivity and expand our market opportunity and enable our customers to enjoy the benefits of AI-enabled robotics and automation solutions at scale. We also intend to expand our product module and solution offerings to other applications throughout the customer value chain. By providing robust, holistic solutions for a variety of market verticals and applications, we believe we will be able to penetrate our target markets further.
Expand Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) and other recurring and re-occurring revenue streams
To date, our revenues are primarily generated from the sale of our solutions. Customers have the option to buy our solutions outright or under a subscription-based model, RaaS. We believe the RaaS model will be financially attractive to many customers and will contribute to our growth. Additionally, we offer certain post-installation services which can renewed annually. We believe there is growth potential for recurring and re-occurring revenue streams, and we intend to accelerate offering additional value-add services, aftermarket component replacement programs, and expanding our software capabilities and services to maximize revenue from our installed base.
Pursue strategic partnerships
We intend to pursue strategic partnerships with systems integrators, companies with complimentary technologies, software application providers, distributors, and consulting firms to expand the channels in which our solutions are marketed. We believe working with these partners will allow us to accelerate our brand awareness within a variety of industries, provide complementary capabilities, and differentiation that will attract new customers, while helping us to expand our customer base.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that we offer a unique solution in the marketplace that automates the most difficult manual processes within warehouse operations. Our technology is the core of our competitive strength, providing us with the following competitive advantages:
Proven technology — our solutions are in use today by large customers
To date, most of our deployments have been with large, Fortune 50 companies, where our technology and solutions in production have achieved targeted ROI and other metrics including throughput, accuracy, equipment effectiveness, and others. Many of our customers have placed follow-on orders and are deploying our technology throughout their networks.
Asset-light business model
Our core hardware product modules are manufactured via third-party contract manufacturers. This is a deliberate strategy and we believe our investment in our processes will enable us to scale production rapidly. We therefore do not have plans to build factories to produce our product modules. We intend to continue to utilize a network of contract manufacturers to leverage their expertise in scaling production systems, sourcing key raw materials and implementing world-class quality

control processes. This approach reduces scaling risk and allows us to focus our resources on designing solutions, continuously improving our artificial intelligence platforms and ensuring customer satisfaction.
Creative pricing models
We offer the option for our customers to purchase our solutions outright or under a subscription-based RaaS pricing model. RaaS pricing models enable some customers easier access to our technology and to automate today and support their plans for tomorrow. RaaS makes it possible to address labor availability challenges, avoid costly new warehouse buildouts, and secure the operational and financial benefits of complete AI-enabled robotics and automation solutions without requiring significant upfront capital requirements.
Experienced management team and deep technological engineering capabilities
Our management team has operational experience bringing emerging technologies to market across the hardware and software sectors. Members of our management and engineering teams have significant experience at various companies and institutions focusing on robotics, artificial intelligence, and other automation technologies. Our ability to innovate and develop AI-enabled robotics and automation solutions is essential to our success. Of our approximately 280 employees as of December 31, 2022, approximately 75% have technical degrees and approximately 160 have advanced degrees.
Competition
Today, we primarily compete against conventional, manual systems supported by human labor despite fundamental issues impacting businesses including labor availability, increasing consumer expectations, and increasing competitive pressures. This is partly due to the current low penetration of automation technology and partly due to the familiarity with existing manual systems and processes. When it comes to conventional equipment providers in this space, some provide equipment to support these manual processes such as conveyor belts and static manual shelving units that we, at Berkshire Grey, do not manufacture or sell as a primary solution. Some traditional material handling companies also offer AS/RS solutions which store and move goods in support of manual processes. In addition to traditional equipment providers, there are also development stage companies endeavoring to produce new technology for some of our targeted verticals and segments where many are focusing on component technologies, e.g., novel grippers, or even a mobile robot that, for example, performs only the specific task of carrying a batch picked-bin. There are also mature companies that provide component technologies such as vision or camera systems. Component technologies, however, do not provide a whole solution. At Berkshire Grey, we both pioneer new AI-enabled technologies and approach the customers from an enterprise perspective with our IER portfolio of capabilities, where solutions can include our technologies for picking, sortation, movement and mobility, and whole system orchestration — and where our services include full analysis and design, installation, and even system operation at the customers’ option. In addition to the discussion above, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of material risks to us relating to our competitive position.
Customers
Our customers include some of the largest retailers and logistics companies in the world and include Walmart, Target, TJX and FedEx. We have also secured additional medium sized customers within our five market verticals: retail, ecommerce, grocery, package handling and 3PL. Since inception, our customers have ordered approximately $265 million of solutions from us, and as of December 31, 2022, we had orders of approximately $101 million in backlog that we expect to deliver and install during 2023 and early 2024.
Research and Development
We believe our research and development capability provides us with a key competitive advantage. Our team of engineers has well over 1,000 years of combined advanced robotics experience and have backgrounds at many of the world-leading robotics, artificial intelligence and research organizations. We conduct research and development in our Innovation and R&D centers in in Bedford and Lexington Massachusetts, as well as at our R&D center located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Our research and development activities currently include programs in the following areas:
•Expanding the capabilities of and making improvements to our technology — We intend to continually improve our technologies, differentiated hardware, and software platforms based on the learning from our 


installed base and areas that we identify can provide more benefit to our customers. We also intend to expand our efforts to continuously reduce system cost.
•Expand the capabilities of our artificial intelligence software platforms — Our product modules and solutions are powered by our artificial intelligence software platforms which we expect will constantly evolve to become more robust, offer more value-add capability, improve system performance and expand solutions offerings. 
 •Expand our product module and solution offerings — The robotics and AI automation industry is constantly evolving and needs to be flexible based on the changing buying behaviors of consumers and the introduction of new technologies. We intend to expand our product module and solution offerings to provide additional solutions for customers in application areas for which we currently do not have a solution. Additionally, we intend to develop solutions in adjacent applications, which could help expand our customer base or expand the penetration within existing and prospective customers. 
 Sales and Marketing
Our go-to market strategy consists of expanding our relationships with our strategic customers, securing new customers through direct sales and establishing strategic partnerships. We have general managers leading each of our five market verticals who have teams in place to build our pipelines and expand our customer base. We also have dedicated resources for certain key customers due to their size and potential opportunity. We intend to continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts to build our customer base and expand geographically.
We intend to pursue strategic partnerships with systems integrators, companies with complimentary technologies, software providers, distributors, and consulting firms to expand the channels in which our solutions are marketed. We believe working with these partners will allow us to accelerate our brand awareness within a variety of industries, provide complementary capabilities, and differentiation that will attract new customers, while helping us to expand our customer base.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our hardware product modules are manufactured via third-party contract manufacturers with international quality certifications. We develop and design product modules and processes and often build engineering prototypes. Our engineers and supply chain teams work collaboratively with our third-party contract manufacturers to develop processes to enable commercialization at scale. Our third-party contract manufacturers provide a variety of services including sourcing off-the-shelf components, manufacturing custom components, final assembly and integration, end of line testing and quality assurance per our specifications.
We initially manage the supply chain for key components, and then set up supply agreements to ensure stable supply and redundancy where applicable. Depending on the criticality of the component, our internal supply chain group may continue to manage the supplier relationship throughout the life of the solution. Commodity consumables are qualified and purchased directly from known industry leaders and provided to the customer to properly support equipment operation. In some circumstances, key consumables used in our solutions are developed and produced with partners to ensure protection of intellectual property and production that meets our specifications and quality requirements.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to drive innovation in the robotics and AI automation market depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our contractors and employees and through non-disclosure agreements with our customers, vendors and business partners. Unpatented research, development, know-how and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, but we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.
Our differentiated hardware is protected in part by 198 patents issued and 330 patents pending. The AI algorithms and software are trade secrets. Our patents and patent applications are directed to, among other things, intelligent robotics for the enterprise and span areas of focus including overall systems and processes, sensing and perception, gripping, and other mechanisms. In addition, we own more than 28 U.S. trademarks registrations and applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 280 full-time employees based primarily in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area, as well as an office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We also engage consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce on an as needed basis. A majority of our employees are engaged in engineering, research and development, and related functions. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We aim to cultivate a high-performing, diverse and engaged workforce through our benefits offerings and internal corporate culture. The principal purposes of our incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees and consultants through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance awards.
Government Regulations
Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, laws, regulations and permitting requirements of federal, state and local authorities, including related to environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and export controls. In addition to the discussion below, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including, but not limited to, emissions into the air and water and the use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. A certain risk of environmental liability is inherent in our production activities, operation of our solutions and the disposal of our solutions. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the generation, use, storage, registration, handling and disposal of chemicals and waste materials, the presence of specified substances in electrical products, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals and other waste materials and the health and safety of our employees.
The export of our solutions internationally from our facilities subjects us to environmental laws and regulations concerning the import and export of electronics and other equipment. These laws and regulations require the testing and registration of some materials that form a part of our solutions.
Export and Trade Matters
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. We are also subject to various trade restrictions, including trade and economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations. For example, in accordance with trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and export controls administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving certain persons and certain designated countries or territories, including Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea and the Crimea Region of Ukraine. In addition, our solutions may be subject to export regulations that can involve significant compliance time and may add additional overhead cost to our solutions. In recent years the United States government has a renewed focus on export matters. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and regulatory guidance thereunder have imposed additional controls and may result in the imposition of further additional controls, on the export of certain “emerging and foundational technologies.” Our current and future solutions may be subject to these heightened regulations, which could increase our compliance costs.

See “Risk Factors — Our existing and planned global operations subject us to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our business is subject to risks associated with selling our solutions in locations outside the United States” beginning on page 17 of this annual report on form 10-K for additional information about the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that apply to our business.

Such reports are also available by accessing the EDGAR database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
 Our website is also a key source of important information about us. We post to the Investor Relations section of our website important information about our business, our operating results and our financial condition and prospects. The website also has a Corporate Governance page that includes, among other things, copies of our charter, our bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our Insider Trading Policy and the charters for each standing committee of our Board of Directors: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Copies of our charter, our bylaws, our other corporate governance documents and our SEC reports are also available in print to stockholders upon request addressed to Investor Relations, Berkshire Grey, Inc., 140 South Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730 or by bgry@investorrelations.com.
