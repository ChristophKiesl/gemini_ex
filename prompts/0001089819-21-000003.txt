Certain Factors Affecting Cleco Power
As an electric utility, Cleco Power is affected by a number of factors influencing the electric utility industry in general. For more information on these factors, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 — Cleco Power — Significant Factors Affecting Cleco Power.”
Power Generation
As of December 31, 2020, Cleco Power’s aggregate net electric generating capacity was 3,186 MW. This amount reflects the maximum production capacity these units can sustain over a specified period of time. On March 1, 2019, Cleco Power began to operate the Dolet Hills Power Station on a seasonal dispatch from June through September; however, the Dolet Hills Power Station will continue to be available to operate in other months, if needed. In June 2020, after thorough evaluation, management decided to retire the Dolet Hills Power Station. For more information regarding the Dolet Hills Power Station anticipated closure, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 6 — Regulatory Assets and Liabilities — Dolet Hills Closure Costs.” Cleco Power anticipates filing an application with the LPSC in March 2021 giving notice that the Dolet Hills Power Station will be retired at the end of 2021 and requesting approval of the regulatory treatment and recovery of the stranded costs and decommissioning costs over 20 years.
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to Cleco Power’s generating facilities as of December 31, 2020:

The following table sets forth the amounts of power generated by Cleco Power for the years indicated:

YEAR | THOUSANDMWh | PERCENT OFTOTAL ENERGYREQUIREMENTS
2020 | 11,801 | | 101.5 | %
2019 | 12,552 | | 103.0 | %
2018 | 11,848 | | 94.6 | %
2017 | 10,864 | | 91.1 | %
2016 | 12,759 | | 103.6 | %


Cleco Power’s generation dispatch and transmission operations are integrated with MISO. The amount of power generated by Cleco Power is dictated by the availability of Cleco Power’s generating fleet and the manner in which MISO dispatches each generating unit. Depending on how generating units are dispatched by MISO, the amount of power generated may be greater than or less than total energy requirements. Generating units are dispatched by referencing each unit’s economic efficiency as it relates to the overall MISO market. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, 

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates.”
Fuel and Purchased Power 
Changes in fuel expenses reflect fluctuations in the amount, type, and pricing of fuel used for electric generation; fuel transportation and delivery costs; and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers through Cleco Power’s FAC in subsequent months. Changes in purchased power expenses are a result of the quantity and price of economic power purchased from the MISO market. These quantity changes can be affected by Cleco plant outages and plant performance. For a discussion of certain risks associated with changes in fuel costs and their impact on utility customers, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Operational Risks — Transmission Constraints” and “— Regulatory Risks — LPSC Audits.”
The following table sets forth the percentages of power generated from various fuels at Cleco Power’s electric generating plants, the cost of fuel used per MWh attributable to each such fuel, and the weighted average fuel cost per MWh:

Power Purchases
Cleco Power is a participant in the MISO market. MISO makes economic and routine dispatch decisions regarding Cleco Power’s generating units. Power purchases are made at prevailing market prices, also referred to as LMP, which are highly correlated to natural gas prices. LMP includes a component directly related to congestion on the transmission system. Pricing zones with greater transmission congestion may have higher LMPs. Physical transmission constraints present in the MISO market could increase energy costs within Cleco Power’s pricing zones. For information on Cleco Power’s ability to pass on to its customers substantially all of its fuel and purchased power expenses, see “— Regulatory Matters, Industry Developments, and Franchises — Rates.” For information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates.”
Coal, Petroleum Coke, and Lignite Supply
Cleco Power uses coal for generation at Rodemacher Unit 2. During 2020, Cleco Power contracted with Arch Coal, LLC to provide Cleco Power’s coal needs at Rodemacher Unit 2, utilizing short-term coal agreements. The coal supply agreements were fixed-price contracts. For 2021, Cleco Power intends to meet its coal needs through short-term coal agreements which are expected to be fixed-price contracts. For the transportation of coal, Cleco Power renewed its agreement on January 1, 2020, with Union Pacific Railroad Company to transport coal from Wyoming’s Powder River Basin to Rodemacher Unit 2. The agreement is for three years, expiring December 31, 2022. Cleco Power leases 113 railcars 

to transport its coal under one lease which expires on March 31, 2021. Currently, Cleco Power is exploring multiple railcar lease options, including the renewal of its current lease, to continue its coal transportation once this current lease expires.
The continuous supply of coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. At December 31, 2020, Cleco Power’s coal inventory at Rodemacher Unit 2 was approximately 142,000 tons (approximately a 59-day supply).
Cleco Power uses a combination of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal for generation at Madison Unit 3. Petroleum coke is a by-product of the oil refinery process and is not considered a fuel specifically produced for a market; however, ample petroleum coke supplies are produced from refineries each year throughout the world, particularly in the Gulf Coast region. During 2020, Cleco received its petroleum coke supply from multiple refineries located along the upper and lower Mississippi River. Cleco purchased slightly more than 825,000 tons of petroleum coke during 2020, all of which were either an evergreen extension of a previous agreement or a negotiated agreement for one year ending December 31, 2020. For 2021, Cleco has contracted for 850,000 tons of petroleum coke from multiple refineries located along the upper and lower Mississippi River through one-year agreements ending December 31, 2021. The agreements are priced according to the Advisian Worley Group (formerly Jacobs Consultancy) Pace Petroleum Coke Quarterly Monthly Price Index or the “PACE” Monthly Index.  
During 2020, Cleco purchased approximately 394,000 tons of Illinois Basin coal. Cleco Power uses Louisiana waterways, such as the Mississippi River and the Red River, to 



CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2020 FORM 10-K

deliver both petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal to the Madison Unit 3 plant site. The continuous supply of petroleum coke and Illinois Basin coal may be subject to interruption due to adverse weather conditions or other factors that may disrupt transportation to the plant site. Savage Inland Marine is Cleco Power’s primary transportation coordinator and provider. Cleco Power has a logistics agreement with Savage Inland Marine that is set to expire in March 2028. At December 31, 2020, Cleco Power’s petroleum coke inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 173,000 tons and Cleco Power’s Illinois Basin coal inventory at Madison Unit 3 was approximately 221,000 tons. The total fuel inventory was 394,000 tons (approximately a 59-day supply).
Cleco Power uses lignite for generation at the Dolet Hills Power Station. Cleco Power and SWEPCO each own an undivided 50% interest in the other’s leased and owned lignite reserves within the Dolet Hills mine in northwestern Louisiana. Additionally, through Oxbow, which is owned 50% by Cleco Power and 50% by SWEPCO, Cleco Power and SWEPCO control lignite reserves also located in northwestern Louisiana. Cleco Power and SWEPCO have entered into a long-term agreement with DHLC for the mining and delivery of lignite reserves at both mines, which are operated by SWEPCO. The Amended Lignite Mining Agreement requires Cleco Power and SWEPCO to purchase the lignite mined and delivered by DHLC at cost plus a specified management fee. 
In April 2020, Cleco Power and SWEPCO mutually agreed to not develop additional mining areas for future lignite extraction and subsequently provided notice to the LPSC of their intent to cease mining by June 2020. By September 30, 2020, all lignite reserves intended to be extracted from the Oxbow mine had been extracted. On October 6, 2020, Cleco Power and SWEPCO made a joint filing with the LPSC seeking authorization to close the Oxbow mine. Cleco Power expects to have sufficient lignite fuel available to continue seasonal operations of the Dolet Hills Power Station through 2021. The cost of lignite per MWh increased during 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the mine continuing to incur fixed costs, despite fewer tons of lignite mined compared to prior years. At December 31, 2020, Cleco Power’s lignite inventory at Dolet Hills was approximately 154,000 tons (approximately a 25-day supply).
For more information regarding the various mines and the anticipated closure of the Dolet Hills Power Station, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 6 — Regulatory Assets and Liabilities — Dolet Hills Closure Costs” and Note 15 — “Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Guarantees,” and for more information on Oxbow, see Note 14 — “Variable Interest Entities.”

Cleco Power owns natural gas pipelines and interconnections at all of its generating facilities that allow it to access various natural gas supply markets and maintain a reliable, economical fuel supply for Cleco Power’s customers.
Natural gas was available without interruption throughout 2020. Cleco Power expects to continue to meet its natural gas requirements with purchases on the spot market through daily, monthly, and seasonal contracts with various natural gas suppliers. However, future supplies to Cleco Power remain vulnerable to disruptions due to weather events and transportation issues. Large industrial users of natural gas, including electric utilities, generally have low priority among gas users in the event pipeline suppliers are forced to curtail deliveries due to inadequate supplies. As a result, prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply interruptions. During 2020, in order to partially address potential natural gas fuel curtailments and interruptions, Cleco contracted for natural gas firm transportation with several interstate pipelines for a period of one year ending in late 2021.
Cleco also uses underground salt dome gas storage to help mitigate supply disruptions to Cleco Power’s generating facilities and to operationally balance gas supply to its units. The storage volume is contracted by paying a capacity reservation charge at a fixed rate. There are also variable charges incurred to withdraw and inject gas from storage. At December 31, 2020, Cleco Power had 1.6 million MMBtu of gas in storage. Currently, Cleco Power anticipates that its diverse supply options and gas storage, combined with its solid-fuel generation resources, are adequate to meet its generation needs during any temporary interruption of natural gas supplies.
Sales
Cleco Power’s 2020 and 2019 system peak demands, which occurred on July 13, 2020, and September 6, 2019, were 2,536 MW and 2,492 MW, respectively. Sales and system peak demand are affected by weather and are typically highest during the summer air-conditioning season; however, peaks may occur during the winter season as well. For information on the effects of future energy sales on Cleco Power’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Operational Risks — Future Electricity Sales” and “— Weather Sensitivity.”

Reserve margin is the net capacity resources (either owned or purchased) less native load demand, divided by native load demand. Members of MISO submit their forecasted native load demand to MISO each year. During 2020, Cleco Power’s reserve margin was 30.5%, which was above MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 8.9%. During 2019, Cleco Power’s reserve margin was 31.7%, which was also above MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 7.9%. Cleco Power expects to meet or exceed MISO’s unforced planning reserve margin benchmark of 9.4% in 2021. For more information on MISO, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Transmission Rates.” 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the LPSC issued an executive order prohibiting the disconnection of utilities for nonpayment from March 13, 2020 through July 16, 2020. As a result of this executive order, Cleco Power suspended the assessment of late fees, disconnections, and the utilization of collection agencies, which resulted in no additional charge-offs during the second and third quarters of 2020. Cleco resumed disconnections and late fees beginning October 1, 2020. On July 16, 2020, Cleco Power began setting up payment plan arrangements for customers with past due balances to be repaid over a period of up to 18 months. For more information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sales, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — COVID-19.”
In August and October 2020, Cleco Power's distribution and transmission systems sustained substantial damage from three separate hurricanes, resulting in significant outages for its customers. On August 27, 2020, Hurricane Laura made landfall hitting the southwest coast of Louisiana causing power outages for approximately 140,000 of Cleco Power’s electric customers. On October 9, 2020, Hurricane Delta made landfall in southwest Louisiana resulting in power outages for approximately 132,000 of Cleco Power’s electric customers. On October 28, 2020, Hurricane Zeta made landfall in southeast Louisiana resulting in power outages for approximately 73,000 of Cleco Power’s electric customers. For more information on Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Cleco Power — Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Zeta.”

Cleco Cajun
Power Generation
On February 4, 2019, Cleco Cajun acquired from NRG Energy all of the outstanding membership interests in NRG South Central. As a result, Cleco Cajun became a reportable segment. For more information about the Cleco Cajun Transaction, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 3 — Business Combinations.”
In December 2020, Cleco Cajun retired the 176-MW Sterlington generating facility located in Sterlington, Louisiana. As the facility had reached the end of its useful life, Cleco Cajun determined that it would be more cost effective to retire the Sterlington generating facility than it would be to make the necessary improvements to continue its operation.
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to Cleco Cajun’s generating facilities:

Fuel and Purchased Power 
Cleco Cajun uses coal and natural gas for its power generation resources. Cleco Cajun procures these fuels under contracts from a variety of suppliers and transporters. Cleco Cajun maintains an inventory of coal supply on-site at its coal generating facilities. Cleco Cajun has a lease for 135 railcars for coal transportation, which commenced in February 2019 with an initial term of 12 months. On January 27, 2020, this lease was renewed and is set to expire on March 31, 2021. However, at the end of the current term, this lease will renew for additional one-month terms unless Cleco Cajun chooses to terminate. 
Sales
Cleco Cajun sells wholesale electric supply in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. It furnishes supply to its wholesale customers primarily through all-requirements power supply and service agreements, which require Cleco Cajun to provide the electric capacity, energy, and other services necessary to serve most of its customers’ load requirements. Cleco Cajun procures the entirety of the power required to fulfill these obligations through its participation in the MISO market.
Cleco Cajun’s business experiences seasonality, as it bills its customers based on actual electric energy consumed. This usage tends to be greater during periods of high and low temperatures as compared to periods of moderate temperatures. 
Competition
Competition for Cleco Cajun’s customers is limited through 2025, when the majority of the wholesale electric supply contracts terminate. Cleco Cajun is currently participating in co-operative requests for proposals for load after 2025. Failure to recontract current cooperative load or enter into new contracts to replace the existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on Cleco Cajun's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. Within MISO, competitors typically comprise of investor-owned utilities, independent power producers, power marketers, and power plant developers. These entities typically compete on the basis of price, reliability, and residual risk to the purchasing customer and its end users. 
Customers
Cleco Cajun did not have a significant customer that accounted for 10% or more of Cleco’s consolidated revenue in 2020 or 2019. For more information regarding Cleco Cajun’s sales and revenue, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations.”

REGULATORY MATTERS, INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS, AND FRANCHISES

Rates
Cleco Power’s electric operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the LPSC with respect to retail rates, standards of service, accounting, and other matters. Cleco Power is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC with respect to transmission tariffs, accounting, interconnections with other utilities, reliability, and the transmission of power. Periodically, Cleco Power has sought and received from both the LPSC and FERC increases in retail rates and transmission tariffs, respectively, to cover increases in operating costs and costs associated with additions to generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. 
Cleco Cajun is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC with respect to transmission tariffs, interconnections with other utilities, reliability, and the transmission of power. The rates Cleco, through Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun, charges its wholesale customers are subject to FERC’s triennial market power analysis. The most recent triennial power analysis was filed on December 23, 2020.
Cleco Power’s annual retail earnings are subject to an FRP that was approved by the LPSC in June 2014. Under the terms of Cleco Power’s current FRP, Cleco Power is allowed to earn a target ROE of 10.0%, while providing the opportunity to earn up to 10.9%. Additionally, 60% of retail earnings between 10.9% and 11.75% and all retail earnings over 11.75% are required to be refunded to customers. The amount of credits due to customers, if any, is determined by Cleco Power and the LPSC annually. Credits are typically included on customers’ bills the following summer, but the amount and timing of the refunds are ultimately subject to LPSC approval. 
Cleco Power’s FRP had a four-year term, and was set to expire in June 2018. As a result of the 2016 Merger, the FRP was extended an additional two years with an expiration of June 2020, and Cleco Power was required to file a new base rate case with the LPSC in June 2019 with any change in rates to be implemented in July 2020. On June 28, 2019, Cleco Power filed an application with the LPSC for a new FRP. However, there has been a delay in the current base rate case. Cleco Power has responded to multiple sets of data requests relating to the new FRP. Unless the 2014 FRP were to be extended by order of the LPSC, the FRP rates established in July 2019 will remain in effect. An FRP monitoring report for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020, was not required. Cleco Power anticipates new rates to be effective in the first half of 2021. However, management is unable to determine the outcome of the base rate case relating to the new FRP.
Generally, Cleco Power’s cost of fuel used for electric generation and the cost of purchased power are recovered through the LPSC-established FAC that enables Cleco Power to pass on to its customers substantially all such charges. Recovery of FAC costs is subject to periodic fuel audits by the LPSC. For more information on the FAC and the most recent fuel audit, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 15 — Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Litigation — LPSC Audits — Fuel Audit.”
In 2009, the LPSC issued Docket No. U-29380 Subdocket A, which provides Cleco Power an EAC to recover from its customers certain costs of environmental compliance. These expenses are eligible for recovery through Cleco Power’s EAC

For more information on Cleco Power’s retail rates, including Cleco Power’s FRP, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Regulatory Risks — Cleco Power’s Rates,” “— Retail Electric Service,” and “— LPSC Audits” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Retail Rates of Cleco Power.” For more information on Cleco’s wholesale rates, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Regulatory Risks — Wholesale Electric Service” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters — Wholesale Rates.”
Franchises
Cleco Power operates under nonexclusive franchise rights granted by governmental units, such as municipalities and parishes (counties), and enforced by state law. These franchises are for fixed terms, which vary from 10 years to more than 50 years. Historically, Cleco Power has been substantially successful in the timely renewal of franchises as each neared the end of its term. Cleco Power’s next municipal franchise expires in April 2022.

Legislative and Regulatory Changes and Matters
Various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of the electric utility industry. Such issues include, among others:
•the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs,
•the impact of the TCJA on regulated public utilities,
•the role of electric utilities, independent power producers, and competitive bidding in the purchase, construction, and operation of new generating capacity,
•the role of electric utilities and independent transmission providers in competitive bidding in the construction of new transmission facilities,
•the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility’s transmission system, or the cost of transmission services provided by an RTO/ISO,
•FERC’s assessment of market power and a utility’s ability to buy generation assets,
•mandatory transmission reliability standards,
•NERC’s imposition of additional reliability and cybersecurity standards,
•the authority of FERC to grant utilities the power of eminent domain,
•increasing requirements for renewable energy sources,
•demand response and energy efficiency standards,
•comprehensive multi-emissions environmental regulation in the areas of air, water, and waste,
•regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,
•regulation of the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants, and
•FERC’s increased ability to impose financial penalties. 
At this time, management is unable to predict the outcome of such issues or the effects thereof on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
For information on certain regulatory matters and regulatory accounting affecting Cleco, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Regulatory and Other Matters.”

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Environmental Quality
Cleco is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties. Cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations, and management believes Cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits, as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental requirements affecting electric power facilities are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time as a result of new legislation, administrative actions, and judicial interpretations. Therefore, the capital costs and other expenditures necessary to comply with existing and new environmental requirements are difficult to determine. Cleco Power may request recovery of the costs to comply with certain environmental laws and regulations from its retail customers. If revenue relief were to be approved by the LPSC, then Cleco Power’s retail rates could increase. If the LPSC were to deny Cleco Power’s request to recover all or part of its 



CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2020 FORM 10-K

environmental compliance costs, then Cleco Power would bear those costs directly. Such a decision could negatively impact the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. For Cleco Power’s expected capital expenditures related to environmental compliance in 2021, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Condition — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Cash Generation and Cash Requirements — Capital Expenditures.” 
Air Quality
Air emissions from each of Cleco’s generating units are strictly regulated by the EPA and the LDEQ. The LDEQ has authority over and implements certain air quality programs established by the EPA under the federal CAA, as well as its own air quality regulations. The LDEQ establishes standards of performance and requires permits for EGUs in Louisiana. All of Cleco’s generating units are subject to these requirements.
The EPA has proposed and adopted rules under the authority of the CAA relevant to the emissions of SO2 and NOx from Cleco’s generating units. 
Regional Haze State Implementation Plan (SIP)
The CAA contains a regional haze program with the goal of returning Class I Federal areas of the nation to natural visibility by 2064. States are required to develop a regional haze SIP and revise it every ten years. A SIP must include requirements for the installation of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) for applicable EGUs in Louisiana. The EPA issued a final approval of the Louisiana SIP for the first planning phase in December 2017. Although the approval was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association, the court denied all the challenges to the EPA’s approval of the Louisiana Regional Haze SIP. Because the Louisiana SIP mandates use of existing controls and participation in the Cross State Air Pollution rule as BART, Cleco does not believe the Louisiana SIP will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. The second planning period for the regional haze program covers the period from 2018 through 2028 and requires states to adopt SIPs that make reasonable further progress toward achieving natural visibility conditions in Class I Federal areas. The SIP for the second planning phase is due to be submitted to the EPA by July 31, 2021. Until the LDEQ determines what the reasonable progress requirements are for Cleco units and completes its update of the SIP and the EPA approves the SIP, Cleco is unable to predict if the second phase SIP will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Acid Rain Program
The CAA also established the Acid Rain Program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on acid rain-causing SO2 emissions from certain generating units. The CAA requires these EGUs to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of SO2 emitted beginning in the year 2000. The EPA allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions. Cleco had sufficient allowances for operations in 2020 and expects to have sufficient allowances for 2021 operations under the Acid Rain Program.
The Acid Rain Program also established emission rate limits on NOx emissions for certain generating units. 

Compliance with the acid rain permit limits for NOx has been achieved at all affected facilities. 
CSAPR
In October 2016, the EPA published the finalized CSAPR update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS in the Federal Register. As a result, the EPA proposed Federal Implementation Plans (FIP) that update the EGU CSAPR NOx ozone-season emission budgets and implemented the budgets through the existing CSAPR NOx ozone-season allowance trading program. The FIP required implementation beginning with the 2017 ozone season. These rules did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
On September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially remanded the CSAPR update rule to the EPA because the rule did not set a deadline by which upwind states must eliminate their significant contribution to downwind states’ NAAQS nonattainment. In response to the remand of the rule, on October 30, 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register, Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update for the 2008 ozone NAAQS. However, until the EPA and LDEQ have published and implemented the plan, Cleco is unable to predict if this will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
In October 2015, the EPA promulgated a revision to the 2015 ozone NAAQS, lowering the level of both the primary and secondary standards to 70 ppb. Under the CAA, each state is required to submit a SIP that provides for the implementation, maintenance and enforcement of each primary and secondary NAAQS. In particular, each SIP must contain adequate provisions prohibiting emissions activity within the state which will contribute significantly to non-attainment or interfere with maintenance by any other state with respect to any such primary or secondary ambient air quality standard. This “good neighbor” SIP is to be submitted to the EPA by the state within three years of promulgation of a new or revised NAAQS. The EPA determined that the SIP submittal by Louisiana meets the SIP completeness criteria. However, on February 28, 2020, the EPA issued a proposed rule that indicated it would take separate actions on sub elements of the SIP that are to prohibit emissions to other states which will (1) significantly contribute to nonattainment of the NAAQS and (2) interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS. Cleco is unable to predict the future impact of any requirements imposed under the “good neighbor” SIP for the 2015 ozone NAAQS.
MATS
For more information on the legal proceedings of the MATS ruling, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 15 — Litigation, Other Commitments and Contingencies, and Disclosures about Guarantees — Litigation — LPSC Audits — Environmental Audit.”
On February 7, 2019, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule in which it proposed to find, after considering the cost of compliance relative to the hazardous air pollutant (HAP) benefits, that regulation of HAP emissions under section 112 of the CAA is not appropriate and necessary, which would reverse the EPA’s prior conclusions. However, the EPA further proposed that this new determination would not remove the Coal-and Oil-Fired source category from the CAA list of sources that must be regulated and would not 


16



CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2020 FORM 10-K

affect the existing HAP emissions standards. In addition, the proposal presented the results of the required residual risk and technology review which indicate that residual risks due to HAP emissions from this source category are acceptable and that the current standards provide an ample margin to protect human health. The proposed rule was finalized and published in the Federal Register on May 22, 2020. The final regulation mirrors the elements of the proposed rule. Cleco is in compliance with the rule. This rule did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants. Several petitions for review of the rule’s findings were filed between May and July 2020 in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On January 20, 2021, the new Presidential administration issued an executive order which directs federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The order specifically directs the EPA to consider issuing a proposed rule by August 2021 to suspend, revise, or rescind the rule.
On April 12, 2019, the EPA published in the Federal Register proposed amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Stationary Combustion Turbines to address the results of the required periodic residual risk and technology review of the regulations. The EPA proposed to find that risks from this source category due to air toxics emissions are acceptable and that the existing rule provides an adequate margin of safety to protect public health. The EPA also identified no new cost-effective controls under the technology review that would achieve further emissions reductions from the source category. In addition, the EPA proposed to remove the stay of effectiveness of the emission standards for new lean premix and diffusion flame gas-fired turbines that had been promulgated in 2004. If the stay were lifted as proposed, emission limits could be applied to new or reconstructed lean premix and diffusion flame turbines. In the final rule, which was published in the Federal Register on March 9, 2020, the EPA did not take final action to lift the stay of effectiveness. However, on August 13, 2020, the EPA granted a petition for reconsideration of certain aspects of the EPA’s residual risk and technology review. The EPA indicated it will undertake a rulemaking to address issues in the petition, but also noted that a petition to delist the entire source category remains pending and their decision on that petition could impact this planned rulemaking. Until the EPA has responded to the petitions, Cleco cannot determine if the rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrant. 
CPP/ACE and NSPS
In August 2015, the EPA released the final guidelines referred to as the CPP. These guidelines provided each state with standards for CO2 emissions from the existing units of the state’s utility industry. The EPA derived the limits for each state through a strategy involving a combination of unit efficiency improvements, dispatching away from boilers to combined cycle units, and applying renewable energy. The CPP required significant reductions of CO2 emissions and set interim and final CO2 emission goals for each state. The interim emission goals were scheduled to begin in 2022, with final emission goals required by 2030. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the CPP to remain in place until the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the merits and any ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.

In August 2015, the EPA released the NSPS rules for CO2 emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed units. The rules set requirements and conditions with respect to CO2 emission standards for new units and those that are modified or reconstructed. Cleco does not anticipate a modification or reconstruction of its existing sources that would trigger the application of the CO2 emission limits.
In March 2017, the executive order of Energy Independence was issued. Among other measures, the order directed the EPA to review the CPP, the proposed FIP for the CPP, and the GHG new source performance standards (NSPS). On July 8, 2019, the EPA published in the Federal Register a final rule repealing the CPP and issuing a replacement to the CPP, informally known as the ACE rule. The ACE rule requires state agencies to set standards of performance for each affected generating unit and submit the implementation plan to the EPA for approval by July 8, 2022, with compliance expected within 24 months thereafter. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the EPA’s repeal of the CPP and its 2019 promulgation of ACE were unlawful. The Court therefore issued an order to vacate and remand ACE to the EPA. The Court’s mandate has not yet been issued to allow parties to request reconsideration of the ruling. On January 20, 2021, the new Presidential administration issued an executive order which directs federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The administration also released a non-exhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the ACE rule. Until the Court’s opinion has been determined to be final and the EPA has responded to the Court’s opinion and executive order, management cannot determine the future regulatory requirements for GHGs for the utility industry and the potential impact on Cleco’s existing affected units. However, any new rules that require significant reductions in CO2 emissions for existing EGUs could require significant capital expenditures or curtailment of operations of certain EGUs to achieve compliance.
In December 2018, the EPA published proposed rules to replace the August 2015 NSPS rules for CO2 emissions from new, modified, or reconstructed units. As with the current NSPS rules, the proposed rules set requirements and conditions with respect to CO2 emission standards for new, modified, or reconstructed units. Cleco does not anticipate a future modification or future reconstruction of its existing units, as defined in the proposal, that would trigger the application of the proposed CO2 emission limits. Until the EPA finalizes the rule, management cannot state what the final standards will entail or if the new rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)
The enactment of federal or state RPS mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal energy could result in certain changes in Cleco’s business or its competitive position. These changes could include additional costs for renewable energy credits, alternate compliance payments, or capital expenditures for renewable generation resources. RPS legislation has been enacted in many states, and Congress is considering various bills that would create a national RPS. Cleco continues to evaluate the impacts of potential RPS 


17



CLECO | 
CLECO POWER | 2020 FORM 10-K

legislation on its business based on the RPS programs in other states.
NAAQS
A primary NAAQS for NO2 promulgated by the EPA became effective in April 2010. The EPA established a new one-hour standard at a level of 100 ppb to supplement the existing annual standard. In 2012, the EPA determined that no area in the country was violating the standard. In April 2018, the EPA published, following the required review of the NAAQS, a final action that retains the ambient air standards for NO2. The EPA may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states. Due to the fact that fossil fuel-fired EGUs are a significant source of NO2 emissions in the country, a non-attainment designation could result in utilities such as Cleco being required to substantially reduce their NO2 emissions. However, because the EPA has not yet completed any new designations, Cleco cannot predict the likelihood or potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time.
The EPA revised the NAAQS for SO2 in June 2010. The new standard is now a one-hour health standard of 75 ppb, designed to reduce short-term exposures to SO2 ranging from five minutes to 24 hours. An important aspect of the new SO2 standard is a revised emission monitoring network combined with a new ambient air modeling approach to determine compliance with the new standard. The EPA expects to use monitoring or modeling data developed in the future to confirm the status of areas that currently have no monitoring data. Classification of those areas without adequate data will be deferred until adequate data has been developed. In January 2018, the EPA published a final rule designating all areas containing Cleco generation facilities as either attainment/unclassifiable or unclassifiable. Therefore, there is no adverse impact to Cleco’s generating units.
On March 18, 2019, the EPA published, following the required review of the NAAQS, a final action that retains the ambient air standards for SO2. The EPA may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states. Due to the fact that fossil fuel-fired EGUs are a significant source of SO2 emissions in the country, a non-attainment designation could result in utilities such as Cleco being required to substantially reduce their SO2 emissions. However, because the EPA has not yet completed any new designations, Cleco cannot predict the likelihood or potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time.
Other
On May 2, 2019, Louisiana Generating notified the EPA and the LDEQ that it has elected not to Retrofit (as such term is defined in the Consent Decree) Big Cajun II, Unit 1.
Water Quality
Cleco’s facilities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding wastewater discharges. Cleco has received, from the EPA and the LDEQ, permits required under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) for wastewater discharges from its generating stations. Wastewater discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration, and Cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods.
In March 2011, the EPA proposed regulations which would establish standards for cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to Section 316(b) of the CWA. The EPA published its final rule in August 2014. The standards are intended to protect fish and other 

aquatic wildlife by minimizing capture, both in screens attached to intake structures (impingement mortality) and in the actual intake structures themselves (entrainment mortality). The proposed standards would (1) set a performance standard, dealing with fish impingement mortality or reduce the flow velocity at cooling water intakes to less than 0.5 feet per second and (2) require entrainment standards to be determined on a case-by-case basis by state-delegated permitting authorities. Facilities subject to the proposed standards are required to complete a number of studies within a 45-month period and then comply with the rule as soon as possible after the next discharge permit renewal, by a date determined by the permitting authorities. Portions of the final rule could apply to a number of Cleco’s fossil fuel steam electric generating stations. Until the required studies are conducted, including technical and economic evaluations of the control options available, and regulatory agency officials have reviewed the studies and made determinations, Cleco remains uncertain as to which technology options or retrofits will be required to be installed on its affected facilities. The costs of required technology options and retrofits may be significant, particularly if closed cycle cooling is required.
The CWA requires the EPA to periodically review and, if appropriate, revise technology-based effluent limitations guidelines for categories of industrial facilities, including power generating facilities. In November 2015, the EPA released the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category rule (ELG rule). The rule is focused on reducing the discharge of metals in wastewater from generating facilities to surface waters. 
In April 2017, the EPA Administrator indicated that it is appropriate and in the public interest to reconsider the rule. In September 2017, the EPA published a rule postponing for a two year period the earliest compliance dates for some of the wastewater streams that fall under the ELG rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA published final revisions to the rule that would revise the technology-based effluent limitation guidelines and standards applicable to flue gas desulfurization and bottom ash transport waste waters. The rule may require costly technological upgrades at Cleco’s facilities, particularly if additional wastewater treatment systems are required to be installed or if waste streams must be eliminated. Until Cleco and the agencies have come to agreement on how compliance with the rule will be achieved, management cannot predict what the final standards will entail, what controls the EPA and the state of Louisiana may require of Cleco, or if the new rule will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Solid Waste Disposal
In the course of operations, Cleco’s facilities generate solid and hazardous waste materials requiring eventual disposal. The Solid Waste Division of the LDEQ has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations. Cleco has received all required permits from the LDEQ for the on-site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations.
In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register for regulating the disposal and management of CCRs from coal-fired power plants (CCR Rule). The federal regulation classifies CCRs as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and allows beneficial use of CCRs with some restrictions. The rule establishes extensive requirements for existing and new

CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and Internet posting requirements. In August 2018, the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated several requirements in the CCR regulation which included eliminating the previous acceptability of compacted clay material as a liner for impoundments. As a result, on December 2, 2019, the EPA published a proposed rule that would set deadlines for costly modifications including retrofitting of clay-lined impoundments with compliant liners or closure of the impoundments. The rule was finalized and published in the Federal Register on August 28, 2020. In November 2020, Cleco submitted demonstrations to the EPA specifying its intended course of action for Rodemacher Unit 2, Dolet Hills Power Station, and Big Cajun II in order to comply with the final rule. The demonstrations are subject to EPA approval. 
On November 12, 2020, the EPA published in the Federal Register a final regulation containing impoundment procedures that allow sources to demonstrate liners and underlying soils perform as well as the CCR rule liner criteria and to request approval to continue operating the impoundments. On December 14, 2020, Cleco submitted to the EPA an application and notice of intent to submit an alternate liner demonstration for Rodemacher Unit 2. The application is subject to EPA approval.
On January 20, 2021, the new Presidential administration issued an executive order which directs federal agency heads to review regulations and other actions over the past four years to determine if they are inconsistent with the policies announced in the executive order. The administration also released a nonexhaustive list of agency actions to be reviewed, which includes the CCR rules promulgated in July 2018 and August 2020.
Cleco Power continues to be subject to state regulations pertaining to the disposal of coal ash. Cleco Cajun is also subject to state regulations pertaining to the disposal of coal ash. As a result, Cleco Power and Cleco Cajun have an ARO for the retirement of certain ash disposal facilities. All costs of the CCR rule for Cleco Power are expected to be recovered from its customers in future rates. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation due to the uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. In October 2020, Cleco Power recorded an increase in its ARO of $0.3 million as a result of the CCR rule. In October 2020, Cleco Cajun recorded an increase in its ARO of $1.1 million as a result of the CCR rule. Cleco will continue to gather additional data in future periods and will make decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities. As additional information becomes available and management makes decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities, Cleco will update the ARO balances to reflect these changes in estimates. For more information on Cleco Power’s current AROs, see Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Notes to the Financial Statements — Note 6 — Regulatory Assets and Liabilities — AROs.”
In December 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act), including the WIIN Act’s provisions regarding CCRs was signed into law. The WIIN Act’s CCR provisions require the EPA to establish a 

CCR permitting program. It also allows for implementation of the federal CCR rule through a state-based permit program. On February 20, 2020, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule establishing the federal permit program. Permits will be required for all CCR units in states that do not have state permit programs. Until the state of Louisiana has evaluated the WIIN Act and made a decision on implementing a state-based option, Cleco cannot determine if there will be a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.
Cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its electric generating stations and at other locations. Cleco does not treat, store long-term, or dispose of these wastes on-site; therefore, no permits are required. Hazardous wastes produced by Cleco are properly disposed of at permitted hazardous waste disposal sites.
Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
The TSCA directs the EPA to regulate the marketing, disposing, manufacturing, processing, distributing in commerce, and usage of various toxic substances, including PCBs. Cleco operates and may continue to operate equipment containing PCBs under the TSCA. Once the equipment reaches the end of its useful life, the EPA regulates handling and disposing of the equipment and fluids containing PCBs. Within these regulations, handling and disposing is allowed only through facilities approved and permitted by the EPA. Cleco properly disposes of its PCB waste material at TSCA-permitted disposal facilities.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)
The CERCLA imposes liability on parties responsible for, in whole or in part, the presence of hazardous substances at a site. In 2007, Cleco received a Special Notice for Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) from the EPA for a facility known as the Devil’s Swamp Lake site located just northwest of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The notice requested that Cleco and Cleco Power, along with many other listed potentially responsible parties (PRP), enter into negotiations with the EPA for the performance of an RI/FS at the Devil’s Swamp Lake site. In 2008 the EPA identified Cleco as one of many companies that sent PCB wastes for disposal to the site. The EPA proposed to add the Devil’s Swamp Lake site to the National Priorities List, based on the release of PCBs to fisheries and wetlands located on the site, but no final listing decision has been made. The EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to two PRPs, Clean Harbors, Inc. and Baton Rouge Disposal, to conduct an RI/FS in 2009. The Tier 1 part of the study was completed in June 2012. The tier 2 remedial investigation report, that fish and crawfish from the area should not be eaten, was made public in December 2015. On September 9, 2019, the EPA publicly announced a proposed cleanup strategy for the Superfund Site. Until a final plan is presented by the EPA, management is unable to determine how significant Cleco’s share of the costs associated with a possible response action at the site, if any, may be and whether this will have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows of the Registrants.

Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)
Section 313 of the EPCRA requires certain facilities that manufacture, process, or otherwise use minimum quantities of listed toxic chemicals to file an annual report with the EPA called a Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) report. The TRI report requires industrial facilities to report on approximately 650 substances that the facilities release into the air, water, and land. The TRI report ranks companies based on the amount of a particular substance they release on a state and parish (county) level. Annual reports are due to the EPA on July 1 following the reporting year-end. Cleco has submitted required TRI reports on its activities, and the TRI rankings are available 
to the public. The rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties. 

Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs)
The possibility that exposure to EMFs emanating from electric power lines, household appliances, and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects and damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention. Lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and/or property values have arisen in several states. Neither Cleco nor Cleco Power are parties in any lawsuits related to EMFs.
