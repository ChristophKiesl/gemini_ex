Item 1.    BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

EchoStar Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as “EchoStar,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and/or “our”) is a holding company that was organized in October 2007 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are a global provider of satellite service operations, video delivery solutions, digital set-top boxes, broadband satellite technologies and broadband services for home and small office customers. We deliver innovative network technologies, managed services, and various communications solutions for enterprise and government customers. Our Class A common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SATS.” 
We currently operate in the following three business segments:


• | Hughes — which provides broadband satellite technologies and broadband services to home and small office customers and network technologies, managed services and communication solutions to domestic and international consumers and enterprise and government customers. The Hughes segment also provides managed services, hardware, and satellite services to large enterprises and government customers, and designs, provides and installs gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems. In addition, our Hughes segment provides satellite ground segment systems and terminals to mobile system operators. 


• | EchoStar Technologies — which designs, develops and distributes secure end-to-end video technology solutions including digital set-top boxes and related products and technology, primarily for satellite TV service providers and telecommunication companies. Our EchoStar Technologies segment also provides digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission services, signal processing, conditional access management, and other services, primarily to DISH Network Corporation and its subsidiaries (“DISH Network”) and Dish Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Dish Mexico”), a joint venture we entered into in 2008. In addition, we provide our TV Anywhere technology through Slingbox® units directly to consumers via retail outlets and online, as well as to the pay-TV operator market. Beginning in 2015, this segment also includes our over-the-top (“OTT”), Streaming Video on Demand (“SVOD”) platform business, which primarily provides support services to DISH Network’s Sling TVTM service (“Sling TV”). 


• | EchoStar Satellite Services (“ESS”) — which uses certain of our owned and leased in-orbit satellites and related licenses to provide satellite service operations and video delivery solutions on a full-time and occasional-use basis primarily to DISH Network, Dish Mexico, United States (“U.S.”) government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers, and private enterprise customers. We also manage satellite operations for several satellites owned by third parties. 


Following consummation of the Share Exchange described below under “Pending Share Exchange,” we will no longer operate the EchoStar Technologies business segment.
Our operations also include real estate and other activities that have not been assigned to our operating segments, including costs incurred in certain satellite development programs and other business development activities, expenses of various corporate departments, and our centralized treasury operations, including income from our investment portfolio and interest expense on our debt. 

In 2008, DISH Network completed its distribution to us of its digital set-top box business, certain infrastructure, and other assets and related liabilities, including certain of its satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, and real estate (the “Spin-off”). Since the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly-traded companies. However, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, described in Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report, DISH Network owns preferred tracking stock in EchoStar Corporation and one of our subsidiaries representing an aggregate 80.0% economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of our Hughes segment. The tracking stock is an equity security and the rights of DISH Network, as the holder of the tracking stock, in our assets are subject to the claims of our creditors. In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of EchoStar and DISH Network is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. 
PENDING SHARE EXCHANGE
On January 31, 2017, EchoStar and certain subsidiaries of EchoStar entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) among DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”), DISH Network L.L.C., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of DISH (“DNLLC”), DISH Operating L.L.C., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of DNLLC (“DOLLC” and, collectively with DISH and DNLLC, the “DISH Parties”), EchoStar, EchoStar Broadcasting Holding Parent L.L.C., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of EchoStar’s subsidiary Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation (“EB LLC”), EchoStar Broadcasting Holding Corporation, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of EB LLC (“EB Corp”), EchoStar Technologies Holding Corporation, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of EchoStar (“ET Corp”), and EchoStar Technologies L.L.C., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of EchoStar.
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, among other things: (i) EchoStar will receive all of the shares of EchoStar Tracking Stock (as defined below) owned by DNLLC in exchange for 100% of the equity interests of ET Corp, which will hold that portion of the EchoStar Technologies business segment of EchoStar that (a) designs, develops and distributes secure end-to-end video technology solutions including digital set-top boxes and related products and technology, primarily for satellite TV service providers and telecommunication companies, (b) provides TV Anywhere technology through Slingbox® units directly to consumers via retail outlets and online, as well as to the pay-TV operator market, and (c) includes our over-the-top, Streaming Video on Demand platform business, which includes assets acquired from Sling TV Holding L.L.C. (formerly DISH Digital Holding L.L.C.) and primarily provides support services to DISH’s Sling TV™ operations, and (ii) EB LLC will receive all of the shares of HSS Tracking Stock (as defined below) owned by DOLLC in exchange for 100% of the equity interests of EB Corp, which will hold EchoStar’s business of providing online video delivery and satellite video delivery for broadcasters and pay-TV operators, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission services, signal processing, conditional access management and other services ((i) and (ii) collectively, the “Share Exchange”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, EchoStar will also transfer certain assets, investments in joint ventures, spectrum licenses and real estate properties and the DISH Parties will assume certain liabilities relating to the transferring assets and businesses. In connection with the Share Exchange, EchoStar and DISH Network and certain of their subsidiaries will enter into certain customary agreements covering, among other things, matters relating to taxes, employees, intellectual property and the provision of transitional services. The Share Exchange has been structured in a manner to be a tax-free exchange for each of EchoStar and DISH.
In March 2014, EchoStar and its subsidiary Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation (“HSS”) each issued shares of preferred stock (the “EchoStar Tracking Stock” and “HSS Tracking Stock,” respectively, and together, the “Tracking Stock”) to DNLLC and DOLLC, respectively. The Tracking Stock tracks the economic performance of the residential retail satellite broadband business of our Hughes segment, including certain operations, assets and liabilities attributed to such business (collectively, the “Hughes Retail Group” or “HRG”), and represents in the aggregate an 80.0% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group (the EchoStar Tracking Stock representing a 51.89% and the HSS Tracking Stock representing a 28.11% economic interest in the Hughes Retail Group, respectively). Following the closing of the Share Exchange, the Tracking Stock will be retired and all agreements, arrangements and policy statements with respect to, and terms of, the Tracking Stock will terminate and be of no further effect. For more information regarding the Tracking Stock, see Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report. 
 The Share Exchange is expected to be consummated three business days after the satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions to the transaction (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions at such time), but no earlier than February 28, 2017. The Share Exchange Agreement provides for customary termination rights of EchoStar and DISH, including the right of either party to terminate the Share Exchange Agreement if the Share Exchange has not closed by March 31, 2017. The closing conditions to the transaction involving third parties or governmental approvals have been satisfied (other than those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing).  While we currently expect the Share Exchange to be consummated on or about February 28, 2017, no assurance can be given that the Share Exchange will be consummated on the terms or within the time frame disclosed, or at all.
See “Risks Related to the Pending Share Exchange” in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information regarding the Share Exchange, see Note 20 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 31, 2017.
BUSINESS STRATEGIES

Capitalize on demand for broadband services.  We intend to capitalize on the global demand for satellite-delivered broadband services and enterprise solutions by utilizing, among other things, our industry expertise, technology leadership, increased satellite capacity, access to spectrum resources, and high-quality, reliable service to drive growth in consumer subscribers and enterprise customers.

Expand satellite capacity and related infrastructure.  With the launch in December 2016 of the EchoStar XIX satellite and the expected start of service on the satellite late in the first quarter of 2017, we expect to significantly increase our satellite capacity in North America, Mexico and certain Latin American countries and to add capability for aeronautical, enterprise and international broadband services. We expect that our expertise in the identification, acquisition and development of satellite spectrum and orbital rights and satellite operations, together with our increased satellite capacity and existing, acquired or developed infrastructure, will provide opportunities to enter new international markets.  We also believe market opportunities exist that will facilitate the acquisition or leasing of additional satellite capacity which will enable us to provide services to a broader customer base, including providers of pay-TV services, satellite-delivered broadband, corporate communications, and government services.

Continue development of S-band and other hybrid spectrum resources. We believe we remain in a unique position to deploy a European wide mobile satellite service (“MSS”)/complementary ground component (“CGC”) network and maximize the long-term value of our S-band spectrum, in Europe and other regions within the scope of our licenses.  We will also continue to explore development of S-band similar spectrum assets in additional international markets.

Exploit our video delivery expertise.  With our extensive experience in designing, developing, and operating video delivery systems for satellite direct-to-home (“DTH”) and internet streaming, we believe we can leverage the broader adoption of advanced technologies such as placeshifting functionality, hybrid internet offerings and other in-home solutions to create opportunities for us.  Therefore, if the Share Exchange is not consummated, we will continue to explore opportunities, including partnerships, joint ventures and strategic acquisitions, to expand our existing markets or enter new markets.  In addition, if the Share Exchange is not consummated, we intend to seek opportunities to license our technology to other original equipment manufacturers and pay-TV providers.

Develop improved and new technologies.  Our engineering capabilities provide us with the opportunity to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies, license our technologies to others, and maintain a leading technological position in the industries in which we are active.  
BUSINESS SEGMENTS

HUGHES SEGMENT

Our Products and Services

Our Hughes segment is a global provider of broadband satellite technologies and broadband services for home and small office customers. We deliver network technologies, managed services, equipment, and communications solutions for domestic and international consumers and enterprise and government customers. In addition, our Hughes segment provides and installs gateway and terminal equipment and provides satellite ground segment systems and terminals for other satellite systems, including mobile system operators. 

Our Hughes segment provides satellite broadband internet access and satellite technologies to North American home and office costumers, which we refer to as the consumer market, and broadband network technologies, managed services, equipment and communications solutions to domestic and international enterprise and government customers.  Our Hughes segment also provides managed services, equipment and communications solutions to large enterprise customers for mobile satellite systems.  We incorporate advances in technology to reduce costs and to increase the functionality and reliability of our products and services.  Through the usage of advanced spectrally efficient modulation and coding methodologies, proprietary software web acceleration and compression techniques, we continue to improve the efficiency of our networks.  We invest in technologies to enhance our system and network management capabilities, specifically our managed services for enterprises.  We also continue to invest in next generation technologies that can be applied to our future products and services.  Our consumer revenue growth depends on our success in adding new subscribers and driving higher average revenue per subscriber across our wholesale and retail channels. The growth of our enterprise and equipment businesses relies heavily on global economic conditions and the competitive landscape for pricing relative to competitors and alternative technologies. 
With the launch in December 2016 and expected start of service of the EchoStar XIX satellite late in the first quarter of 2017, we expect to increase our subscribers and grow our consumer, enterprise and government revenue.  The addition of new subscribers and the performance of our consumer service offering, primarily drive the revenue growth in our consumer business.  Service costs related to ongoing support of our direct and indirect customers and partners are typically impacted most significantly by our growth.  Long-term trends continue to be influenced primarily by the subscriber growth in our consumer business.

Our Hughes segment currently uses its two owned satellites, the SPACEWAY 3 satellite and the EchoStar XVII satellite, and additional satellite capacity acquired from multiple third-party providers, to provide satellite broadband internet access and communications services to our customers. We currently provide HughesNet Gen4 satellite broadband internet services to our consumer market customers in North America on the EchoStar XVII satellite. In December 2016, we launched our EchoStar XIX satellite, a next-generation, high throughput geostationary satellite, which will provide significant capacity for continued subscriber growth. The EchoStar XIX satellite employs a multi-spot beam, bent pipe Ka-band architecture and will provide additional capacity for the Hughes broadband services to our customers in North America and added capacity in Mexico and certain Latin American countries and is expected to add capability for aeronautical, enterprise and international broadband services. EchoStar contributed the EchoStar XIX satellite to its Hughes segment in February 2017. 

We continue our efforts to grow our consumer satellite services business outside of the U.S. In April 2014, we entered into a satellite services agreement pursuant to which Eutelsat do Brasil provides us Ka-band capacity into Brazil on the EUTELSAT 65 West A satellite for a 15-year term.  That satellite was launched in March 2016 and we began delivering high-speed consumer satellite broadband services in Brazil in July 2016. In September 2015, we entered into satellite services agreements pursuant to which affiliates of Telesat Canada (“Telesat”) will provide to us the Ka-band capacity on a satellite to be located at the 63 degree west longitude orbital location for a 15-year term. We expect the satellite to be launched in the second quarter of 2018 and plan to provide service in additional markets across South America once that capacity is available for commercial use. 

Our Customers

Our Hughes segment delivers broadband satellite technologies and broadband internet services to North American home and small office customers.  It also delivers network technologies, managed services, hardware, equipment and satellite communications solutions for domestic and international consumers and enterprise and government customers worldwide.  In addition, our Hughes segment provides and installs gateway and terminal equipment and provides satellite ground segment systems and terminals for other satellite systems, including mobile system operators. Examples of our enterprise and government customers include lottery agencies, gas station operators and companies with multi-branch networks that rely on satellite or terrestrial networks for critical communication across wide geographies. Most of our enterprise customers have contracts with us for the services they purchase. Developments toward the launch of next-generation satellite systems including low-earth orbit (“LEO”) and geostationary systems could provide additional opportunities to drive the demand for our network equipment and services. 

In October 2012, we entered into a distribution agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with dishNET Satellite Broadband L.L.C. (“dishNET”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network, pursuant to which dishNET has the right, but not the obligation, to market, sell and distribute the Hughes satellite internet service (the “Hughes service”) under the dishNET brand.  DISH Network accounted for 7.7%, 7.8% and 8.5% of our total Hughes segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  See Note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our related party transactions with DISH Network.

As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our Hughes segment had approximately 1,036,000, 1,035,000 and 977,000 broadband subscribers, respectively.  These broadband subscribers include customers that subscribe to our HughesNet broadband services through retail, wholesale and small/medium enterprise service channels.  

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Hughes segment had approximately $1.52 billion and $1.44 billion, respectively, of contracted revenue backlog.  We define Hughes contracted revenue backlog as our expected future revenue under customer contracts that are non-cancelable, excluding agreements with customers in our consumer market. Of the total contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2016, we expect to recognize approximately $436.5 million of revenue in 2017.

Our Competition

The network communications industry is highly competitive.  As a global provider of data network products and services, our Hughes segment competes with a large number of telecommunications service providers.  This increasingly competitive 
environment has put pressure on prices and margins.  To compete effectively, we emphasize our network quality, our customization capability, our offering of networks as a turnkey managed service, our position as a single point of contact for products and services and our competitive prices.

In our consumer market, we compete against traditional telecommunications and wireless carriers, other satellite internet providers, as well as digital subscriber line (“DSL”) and cable internet service providers offering competitive services in many communities we seek to serve.  Cost, speed and accessibility are key determining factors in the selection of a service provider by the consumer.  Our primary satellite competitor in our North American consumer market is ViaSat Communications, Inc. (“ViaSat Communications”), which is owned by ViaSat, Inc. (“ViaSat”).  We seek to differentiate ourselves based on the ubiquitous availability of our service, quality, proprietary technology, and distribution channels.

In our enterprise and government markets, our principal competitors for the supply of very-small-aperture terminal (“VSAT”) satellite networks are Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd, ViaSat, SageNet LLC, Newtec and iDirect Technologies (“iDirect”).  To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, we emphasize particular technological features of our products and services, our ability to customize networks and perform desired development work and the quality of our customer service. We also face competition from resellers and numerous local companies who purchase equipment and sell services to local customers, including domestic and international telecommunications operators, cable companies and other major carriers.

Manufacturing

Certain products in our Hughes segment are assembled at our facilities in Maryland and we outsource a significant portion of the manufacturing of our products to third parties.  We believe that the manufacturing facilities used by our Hughes segment have sufficient capacity to handle current demand.  We adjust our capacity based on our production requirements.  We also work with third-party vendors for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products.  We develop dual sourcing capabilities for critical parts when practical and we evaluate outsourced subcontract vendors on a periodic basis.  Our operations group, together with our engineering group, works with our vendors and subcontractors to reduce development costs, to increase production efficiency, and to obtain components at lower prices.
ECHOSTAR TECHNOLOGIES SEGMENT 

Our Products and Services

Our EchoStar Technologies business segment provides secure end-to-end video and broadcast technology products and services to businesses and directly to consumers. Following consummation of the Share Exchange, we will no longer operate the EchoStar Technologies segment.
Video Delivery Products and Related Technologies.  Our EchoStar Technologies segment designs, develops and distributes a wide range of video delivery products and related technologies that allow consumers to watch and control their subscription and over-the-air (“OTA”) TV programming from inside their homes.  Our current video delivery products and related technologies include:

• | Set-top boxes. Provides consumers with the ability to access the enhanced picture quality and sound of 4K, high-definition (“HD”) and/or standard definition (“SD”) content, interactive applications, broadband connectivity and Bluetooth audio streaming, depending on the type of set-top box purchased. 


• | DVR and Whole-Home HD DVR solutions. Provides customers with the ability to record, replay and store content and multi-room HD content sharing functionality to create a whole-home entertainment experience, including commercial skipping and sideloading technologies. 


• | TV Anywhere “Placeshifting” Functionality. Provides customers with the ability to watch and control digital television content on a desktop or mobile device via a broadband internet connection. Customers have these abilities when using our set-top boxes as well as our standalone Slingbox units, which are sold directly to consumers via retail outlets and online, as well as to the pay-TV operator market. 


In addition to digital set-top boxes, we design and develop related products such as satellite dishes and remote controls.

Video Broadcast Services.  Our EchoStar Technologies segment also provides online video delivery and satellite video delivery for broadcasters and pay-TV operators, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission services, signal processing, 
conditional access management, and other services, primarily to DISH Network and Dish Mexico.  We operate a number of digital broadcast centers in the U.S.  Our principal digital broadcast centers are located in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona.  We also have multiple regional and micro digital broadcast centers that allow us to maximize the use of the spot beam capabilities of our satellites and our customers’ satellites.  Programming and other data are received at these centers by fiber optic cable or satellite.  The data is processed, compressed, encrypted and then uplinked to our satellites and our customers’ satellites for transmission to end-users.

Over-the-Top (“OTT”) Services.  We have developed and launched a comprehensive OTT Streaming Video on Demand and live linear service platform solution currently utilized by DISH Network’s Sling TV service, which launched in 2015.  We have continued to develop and enhance the platform for Sling TV to improve the customer experience.  We also have continued to explore new ways to leverage this technology for other business opportunities.

Our Customers

The primary customer of our EchoStar Technologies segment is DISH Network.  DISH Network accounted for 90.5%, 87.9% and 88.7% of the EchoStar Technologies segment’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  See Note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our related party transactions with DISH Network.  We also currently sell our digital set-top boxes to other international DTH satellite and cable providers, including Bell TV, a DTH satellite services provider in Canada, and Dish Mexico, to whom we also provide video broadcast services. 

The number of potential new customers for our set-top box business in our EchoStar Technologies segment is small and may be limited as prospective customers that have been competitors of DISH Network may continue to view us as a competitor due to our common ownership with DISH Network.  Our customers face emerging competition from other providers of digital media and potential government action preventing them from using security systems in connection with set-top boxes. In particular, programming offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved. 
Our Competition

The video delivery and broadcast and OTT industries are highly competitive. Market leadership changes frequently as a result of new products, designs and pricing, and we face substantial competition.  Many of our primary competitors, such as Arris Group, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Technicolor S.A., have established longstanding relationships with their customers.  In addition, a number of rapidly growing companies have recently entered the market with offerings similar to our existing and contemplated products.  The entry of these new competitors may result in increased pricing pressure in the market.  In the video delivery industry, we may also face competition from international developers of digital set-top box systems that may be able to develop and manufacture products and services at costs that are substantially lower than our costs.  Furthermore, we depend heavily on our ability to successfully bring advanced technologies to the market, including internet delivery of video content and our Slingbox unit’s placeshifting functionality.

We believe our use of proprietary technology, together with our in-house engineering expertise, enables us to innovate and bring new features and enhancements quickly to our customers.  In addition, our end-to-end video solutions may allow us to provide a more cost-effective solution for a pay-TV operator who may have to negotiate hardware, middleware and a conditional access system separately.  We have a long-standing relationship with DISH Network and provide them with technologically advanced set-top boxes, including advanced hybrid satellite and internet protocol over-the-top delivery solutions, Slingbox unit’s placeshifting functionality, and whole-home DVR features.

Our Manufacturers

Although we design, engineer and distribute digital set-top boxes and other products, we are not directly engaged in the manufacturing process.  Rather, we outsource the manufacturing of our products to third parties who manufacture our products according to specifications supplied by us.  We depend on a few manufacturers, and in some cases a single manufacturer, for the production of digital set-top boxes and related products.  Although there can be no assurance, we do not believe that the loss of any single manufacturer would materially impact our business.  Sanmina-SCI Corporation, Shanghai DD&TT Electronic Enterprise Co., LTD and Jabil Circuit, Inc. currently manufacture the majority of our digital set-top boxes and accessories.
ECHOSTAR SATELLITE SERVICES SEGMENT

Our Services

Our ESS segment is a global provider of satellite service operations and video delivery solutions. We operate our business using our owned and leased in-orbit satellites.  We provide satellite services on a full-time and occasional-use basis primarily to DISH Network (our largest customer), Dish Mexico, U.S. government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers and private enterprise customers. We also manage satellite operations for several satellites owned by third parties.  Our satellite capacity is currently used by our customers for a variety of applications:

• | DTH Services. We provide satellite capacity to satellite TV providers, broadcasters and programmers who use our satellites to deliver programming. Our satellites are also used for the transmission of live sporting events, internet access, disaster recovery, and satellite news gathering services. 


• | Government Services. We provide satellite services and technical services to U.S. government service providers. We believe the U.S. government may increase its use of commercial satellites for homeland security, emergency response, continuing education, distance learning, and training. 


• | Network Services. We provide satellite capacity and terrestrial network services to companies. These networks are dedicated private networks that allow delivery of video and data services for corporate communications. Our satellites can be used for point-to-point or point to multi-point communications. 

Our Customers

We provide satellite capacity on our satellite fleet primarily to DISH Network, Dish Mexico, U.S. government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers and private enterprise customers.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, DISH Network accounted for approximately 85.7%, 86.3% and 84.1% of our total ESS segment revenue.  We have entered into certain commercial agreements with DISH Network pursuant to which we are obligated to provide DISH Network with satellite services at fixed prices for varying lengths of time depending on the satellite.  See Note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our related party transactions with DISH Network.  DISH Network’s capacity requirements have been driven by the addition of new channels and migration of programming to high-definition TV and video on demand services. The services that we provide to DISH Network are critical to its nationwide delivery of content to its customers across the U.S. While we expect to continue to provide satellite services to DISH Network, its satellite capacity requirements may change for a variety of reasons, including its ability to construct and launch its own satellites.  Any termination or reduction in the services we provide to DISH Network may cause us to have unused capacity on our satellites and require that we aggressively pursue alternative sources of revenue for this business.  
We currently have available satellite capacity.  Our other satellite service sales generally are characterized by shorter-term contracts or spot market sales. Revenue growth in our ESS segment depends largely on our ability to continuously make additional satellite capacity available for sale. We continue to pursue expanding our business offerings by providing value added services such as telemetry, tracking and control services to third parties, which leverages the ground monitoring networks and personnel currently within our ESS segment.

The agreements with DISH Network for the EchoStar I and EchoStar VIII satellites expired pursuant to their terms effective November 2015.  In addition, our agreement with SES Americom Colorado, Inc. (“SES”) for satellite services on the AMC-16 satellite terminated according to its terms in February 2016.  The loss of capacity and/or service provided on these three satellites has, and is expected to continue to, adversely impact our revenue, results of operations and cash flow.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our ESS segment had contracted revenue backlog attributable to satellites currently in orbit of approximately $1.16 billion and $1.41 billion, respectively.  Of the total contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2016, we expect to recognize approximately $365.1 million of revenue in 2017.

Our Competition

In the fixed satellite services market, our ESS segment competes against larger, well-established satellite service companies, such as Intelsat S.A. (“Intelsat”), SES S.A., Telesat, and Eutelsat Communications S.A. (“Eutelsat”), in an industry that is characterized by long-term contracts and high costs for customers to change service providers.  Therefore, it is difficult to displace customers from their current relationships with our competitors.  Intelsat, SES S.A. and other competitors maintain key North American and other international orbital slots that may further limit competition and competitive pricing.

While we believe that there may be opportunities to capture new business as a result of market trends such as the increased communications demands of homeland security initiatives, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete against our competitors due to their significant resources and operating history.

OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

Our industry is evolving with the increase in worldwide demand for broadband internet access for information, entertainment and commerce. In addition to fiber and wireless systems, other technologies such as geostationary high throughput satellites, low-earth orbit (“LEO”) networks, balloons, and High Altitude Platform Systems have begun to play significant roles in enabling global broadband access, networks and services. We intend to use our expertise, technologies, capital, investments, global presence, relationships and other capabilities to continue to provide broadband internet systems, equipment, networks and services for information, entertainment and commerce in North America and internationally for consumers, enterprises and governments. 
We continue to selectively explore opportunities to pursue partnerships, joint ventures and strategic acquisitions, domestically and internationally, that we believe may allow us to increase our existing market share, expand into new markets and new customers, broaden our portfolio of services, products and intellectual property, and strengthen our relationships with our customers. We may allocate significant resources for long-term initiatives that may not have a short or medium-term or any positive impact on our revenue, results of operations, or cash flow. 

In 2012, we acquired the right to use various frequencies at the 45 degree west longitude orbital location (“Brazilian Authorization”) from ANATEL, the Brazilian communications regulatory agency.  The Brazilian Authorization provides us the rights to utilize Ku-band spectrum, Ka-band spectrum and S-band spectrum.  We are exploring options for the Ka-band and S-band spectrums. In April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Space Systems Loral, LLC (“SS/L”) for the construction of the EchoStar XXIII satellite, a high powered broadcast satellite service (“BSS”) satellite.  The EchoStar XXIII satellite will be deployed at the 45 degree west longitude orbital location. Due to anomalies experienced by our launch provider, the expected launch date of our EchoStar XXIII satellite was delayed and we currently expect to launch the EchoStar XXIII satellite in the first quarter of 2017. We have regulatory obligations to meet certain in-service milestones by the second quarter of 2017 for our Brazilian license at 45 west longitude for the Ka-, Ku- and S-band frequency bands. We currently expect to meet our regulatory milestone for the Ku-band.  We have sought an extension of the S- and Ka-band milestones, which may or may not be granted, and, if granted, may be subject to penalties, additional conditions or other requirements.
In December 2013, we acquired 100% of Solaris Mobile, which is based in Dublin, Ireland and licensed by the European Union and its member states (“EU”) to provide MSS and CGC services covering the entire EU using S-band spectrum.  Solaris Mobile changed its name to EchoStar Mobile Limited (“EchoStar Mobile”) in the first quarter of 2015.  We are in the process of developing commercial services utilizing the operable payload we own on the EUTELSAT 10A satellite, along with our EchoStar XXI S-band satellite.  The EchoStar XXI satellite will provide space segment capacity to EchoStar Mobile.  We believe we are in a unique position to deploy a European wide MSS/CGC network and maximize the long-term value of our S-band spectrum in Europe and other regions within the scope of our licenses. Due to anomalies experienced by our launch provider, the expected launch of our EchoStar XXI satellite was delayed and we currently expect to launch the EchoStar XXI satellite in the second or third quarter of 2017. We had regulatory obligations to meet certain milestones by the fourth quarter of 2016 regarding the operations of the EchoStar XXI satellite across the EU. We have notified the regulators in the EU of our delay and we intend to seek extensions of certain of these requirements to the extent we determine necessary. Although we anticipate being able to receive them, any such necessary extensions may be subject to additional conditions, penalties or other requirements. 

We are tracking closely the developments in next-generation satellite businesses, and we are seeking to utilize our services, technologies and expertise to find new commercial opportunities for our business. In June 2015, we made an equity investment in WorldVu Satellites Limited (“OneWeb”), a global LEO satellite service company. In addition, our Hughes segment entered into an agreement with OneWeb to provide certain equipment and services in connection with the ground systems for OneWeb’s LEO satellites.

Recent Developments

EchoStar XIX. The EchoStar XIX satellite was launched in December 2016 and we expect the satellite to be placed into service late in the first quarter of 2017. We expect the EchoStar XIX satellite to provide additional capacity for the Hughes broadband services to our customers in North America and added capacity in Mexico and certain Latin American countries and to add capability for aeronautical, enterprise and international broadband services. EchoStar contributed the EchoStar XIX satellite to its Hughes segment in February 2017.
Eutelsat 65 West A. The Eutelsat 65 West A satellite was launched in March 2016 and our Hughes segment began to offer consumer broadband services in Brazil using our leased Ka-band payload on the satellite in July 2016. 

EchoStar XXI and EchoStar XXIII. Due to anomalies experienced by our launch providers, the launch dates of our EchoStar XXI and EchoStar XXIII satellites were delayed with expected launch dates in the second or third quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2017, respectively. We are in the process of evaluating the implications of these delays, including, without limitation, potential increased costs, regulatory and contractual milestone compliance and other satellite resource allocations. We had regulatory obligations to meet certain milestones by the fourth quarter of 2016 regarding the operations of the EchoStar XXI satellite across the European Union. We have notified the regulators in the EU of our delay and we intend to seek extensions of certain of these requirements to the extent we determine necessary. Although we anticipate being able to receive them, any such necessary extensions may be subject to additional conditions, penalties or other requirements. We also have regulatory obligations to meet certain in-service milestones by the second quarter of 2017 for our Brazilian license at 45 degree west longitude for the Ka-, Ku- and S-band frequency bands.  We currently expect to meet our regulatory milestone for the Ku-band.  We have sought an extension of the S- and Ka-band milestones, which may or may not be granted, and, if granted, may be subject to penalties, additional conditions or other requirements. 

EchoStar 105/SES-11. Due to anomalies experienced by our launch provider, the expected launch date of our EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite has been delayed until the second quarter of 2017. Our Ku-band payload on the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite will replace our current capacity on the AMC-15 satellite. 
AMC-15 and AMC-16. In August 2014, in connection with the execution of agreements related to the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite, we entered into amendments that extend the terms of our existing agreements with SES Americom Colorado, Inc. (“SES”) for satellite services on the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites. As amended, the term of our agreement for satellite services on certain transponders on the AMC-15 satellite was extended from December 2014 through a certain period following the in-service date of the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite and is being accounted for as an operating lease. The amended agreement for the AMC-16 satellite services extended the term for the satellite’s entire communications capacity, subject to available power, for one year following expiration of the initial term in February 2015 and the agreement terminated according to its terms in February 2016.

Satellite Anomalies and Impairments

Our satellites may experience anomalies from time to time, some of which may have a significant adverse impact on their remaining useful lives, the commercial operation of the satellites or our operating results. We are not aware of any anomalies with respect to our owned or leased satellites that have had any such material adverse effect during the year ended December 31, 2016.  There can be no assurance, however, that anomalies will not have any such adverse impacts in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites were to fail.

We historically have not carried in-orbit insurance on our satellites because we assessed that the cost of insurance was uneconomical relative to the risk of failures. Therefore, we generally bear the risk of any in-orbit failures. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing certain portions of our indebtedness, we are required, subject to certain limitations on coverage, to maintain in-orbit insurance for our SPACEWAY 3, EchoStar XVI, and EchoStar XVII satellites. Based on economic analysis of the current insurance market we have elected to obtain, subject to certain limitations on coverage, launch and in-orbit insurance for our EchoStar XIX, EchoStar XXI and EchoStar XXIII satellites and our interest in the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite. All other satellites, either in orbit or under construction, are not covered by launch or in-orbit insurance. We will continue to assess circumstances going forward and make insurance decisions on a case by case basis. 
We evaluate our satellites for impairment and test for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Certain of the anomalies previously disclosed, may be considered to represent a significant adverse change in the physical condition of a particular satellite. However, based on the redundancy designed 
within each satellite, certain of these anomalies are not necessarily considered to be significant events that would require a test of recoverability.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FCC for our domestic, as well as some international, satellite and telecommunications operations and equipment businesses.  We are also regulated by other U.S. federal agencies, state and local authorities, the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), and certain foreign governments, including the EU.  In addition, we are also subject to the export control laws and regulations and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries with respect to the export of telecommunications equipment and services.  Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with applicable legislation or regulations could result in suspension or revocation of our licenses or authorizations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties.

The following summary of regulations and legislation is not intended to describe all present and proposed government regulation and legislation affecting our business.  Government regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or administrative proceedings, draft legislation or administrative proposals could impact us and our industries to varying degrees.  The FCC and other regulators from time to time initiate proceedings that could adversely impact our satellite operations, including spectrum usage.  We cannot predict either the outcome of these proceedings or proposals or any potential impact they might have on the industry or on our operations. Under its Spectrum Frontiers proceeding, the FCC enabled the use of one of the frequency bands we utilize, the Ka-band, on a shared basis with 5G services, which could limit our flexibility to change the way we use the Ka-band in the future.  The FCC has also opened a proceeding on non-geostationary satellites, which may adversely impact our ability to use certain spectrum for user terminals.

FCC Regulations Applicable to Our Operations

FCC Jurisdiction over Satellite and Terrestrial Operations.  Non-governmental, including commercial entities, that use radio frequencies to provide communications services to, from or within the U.S. are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”).  The Communications Act gives the FCC regulatory jurisdiction over many areas relating to communications operations, including:

• | the assignment of satellite radio frequencies and orbital locations to specific services and companies, the licensing of satellites and earth stations, and the granting of related authorizations;


• | approval for the relocation of satellites to different orbital locations, the replacement of a satellite with another new or existing satellite, and the authorization of specific earth stations to communicate with such newly relocated satellites;


• | ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of assignments, licenses, authorizations, and approvals;


• | avoiding harmful interference with other radio frequency emitters; and


• | ensuring compliance with other applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations.

All satellite licenses issued by the FCC are subject to expiration unless extended by the FCC.  The term of each of our U.S. direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) licenses is 10 years, and our U.S. fixed satellite services (“FSS”) licenses generally have 15 year terms.  We hold licenses and authorizations for satellite and earth stations as well as other services, including terrestrial wireless services.  To obtain and operate under such FCC licenses and authorizations, we must satisfy legal, technical qualification requirements and other conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of certain technical and ongoing due diligence obligations, implementation bonds, annual regulatory fees and various reporting requirements. A license must be obtained prior to launching or operating a satellite.
FCC Jurisdiction over Set-Top Box Operations.  Our digital set-top boxes and similar devices must also comply with FCC technical standards and requirements, including accessibility and other requirements.  The FCC has specific Part 15 regulations for television broadcast receivers and television interface devices. We anticipate that we will no longer be subject to these regulations following the consummation of the Share Exchange.

Telecommunications Regulation.   Many of the services we provide are also subject to FCC regulation as telecommunications services.  For certain services in the U.S., we are required to contribute fees, computed as a percentage of our revenue from telecommunications services to the Universal Service Fund (“USF”) to support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries, and rural health care providers.  Current FCC rules permit us to pass this USF contribution through to our customers.  The FCC also requires broadband internet access and internet telephony service providers to comply with the requirements of the Federal Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”).  CA
LEA generally requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services.  In addition, as a provider of interconnected voice over internet protocol services (“VOIP”), we are required to abide by a number of rules related to telephony service, including rules dealing with the protection of customer information and the processing of emergency calls.

State and Local Regulation

We are also regulated by state and local authorities.  While the FCC has preempted many state and local regulations that would impair the installation and use of VSATs and other consumer satellite dishes, our businesses nonetheless are subject to state and local regulation, including, among others, obtaining regulatory authorizations and zoning regulations that affect the ability to install these consumer satellite earth station antennas.
International Regulation

Foreign Administrations’ Jurisdiction Over Satellite and Terrestrial Operations.  Some of our satellites and earth stations are licensed in foreign jurisdictions. We also have terrestrial authorizations in foreign jurisdictions.  In order to provide service to a foreign location from a U.S. satellite, we are required to obtain approvals from the FCC and foreign administrative agencies.  The laws and regulations addressing access to satellite and terrestrial systems vary from country to country.  In most countries, a license is required to provide our services and to operate satellite earth stations.  Such licenses may impose certain conditions, including implementation and operation of the satellite system in a manner consistent with certain milestones (such as for contracting, satellite design, construction, launch, and implementation of service), that the satellite or its launch be procured through a national entity, that the satellite control center be located in national territory, that a license be obtained prior to launching or operating the satellite, or that a license be obtained before interconnecting with the local switched telephone network.  Some countries may have restrictions on the services we provide and how we provide them.  In addition, certain countries may limit the rates that can be charged for the services we provide or impose other service terms or restrictions.

The ITU Frequency and Orbital Location Registration.  The orbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the frequency registration and coordination process of the ITU.  The ITU Radio Regulations define the international rules, regulations, and rights for a satellite and associated earth stations to use specific radio frequencies at a specific orbital location.  These rules, which include deadlines for the bringing of satellite networks into use, differ depending on the type of service to be provided and the frequencies to be used by the satellite.  On our behalf, various countries have made, and may in the future make, additional filings for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that are used or to be used by our current satellite networks and potential future satellite networks we may build or acquire.  In the event the international coordination process that is triggered by ITU filings under applicable rules is not successfully completed, or that the requests for modification of the BSS plan regarding the allocation of orbital locations and frequencies are not granted by the ITU, we will have to operate the applicable satellite(s) on a non-interference basis, which could have an adverse impact on our business operations.  If we cannot do so, we may have to cease operating such satellite(s) at the affected orbital locations.  We cannot be sure of the successful outcome of these ITU coordination processes.  We make commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the filing nation in the preparation of ITU filings, coordination of our operations in accordance with the relevant ITU Radio Regulations, and responses to relevant ITU inquiries.
Registration in the UN Registry of Space Objects.  The U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we license satellites are generally parties to the United Nations (“UN”) Convention on the Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (“UN Convention”).  The UN Convention requires a satellite’s launching state to register the satellite as a space object.  The act of registration carries liability for the registering country in the event that the satellite causes third party damage.  Administrations may place certain requirements on satellite licensees in order to procure the necessary launch or operational authorizations that accompany registration of the satellite.  In some jurisdictions, these authorizations are separate and distinct, with unique requirements, from the authorization to use a set of frequencies to provide satellite services.

Telecommunications Regulation.  Many of the services we provide are also are subject the regulation of other countries as telecommunications services.  For certain services, we may be required to contribute fees to a universal service or other fund to support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to designated groups.  Many countries also impose requirements on telecommunications carriers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services.  In addition, we are subject to a number of other rules, including rules related to telephony service such as the protection of customer information and processing of emergency calls.

Export Control Regulation

In the operation of our business, we must comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries.  Applicable U.S. laws and regulations include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”).

The export of certain hardware, technical data, and services relating to satellites and the supply of certain ground control equipment, technical data and services to non-U.S. persons or to destinations outside the U.S. is regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) under the EAR.  In addition, BIS regulates our export of satellite communications network equipment to non-U.S. persons or to destinations outside of the U.S.  The export of other items is regulated by the U.S. Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (“DDTC”) under the ITAR and are subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements.  In addition, we cannot provide certain equipment or services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC.  We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar foreign regulations, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or giving or promising to give anything of value to foreign government officials and other individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining a competitive advantage.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations.  These include laws regulating air emissions, waste-water discharge and waste management, most significantly the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (“EPCRA”).  Under the RCRA, our Hughes segment is considered a small quantity generator.

As required by the EPCRA, we file annual reports with regulatory agencies covering four areas: Emergency Planning, Emergency Release, Hazardous Chemical Storage, and Toxic Chemical Release Inventory.  We maintain small quantities of hazardous materials on our premises and, therefore, have relatively modest reporting requirements under the EPCRA.  We are also subject to the requirements of other environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations.  Additionally, we review SARA Title III regulatory requirements and annually report quantities of onsite material storage using Tier II, state DEQ (Department of Environmental Quality) reporting systems.

Our environmental compliance costs to date have not been material, and we currently have no reason to believe that such costs will become material in the foreseeable future.  We do not expect capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be material in 2017.  However, environmental requirements are complex, change frequently, and have become more stringent over time.  Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We currently rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, together with licenses, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and technical measures, to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products.  We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and services.  The duration of each of our U.S. patents is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date to which the patent has priority.  We have granted licenses to use our trademarks and service-marks to affiliates and resellers worldwide, and we typically retain the right to monitor the use of those marks and impose significant restrictions on their use in efforts to ensure a consistent brand identity.  We protect our proprietary rights in our software through software licenses that, among other things, require that the software source code be maintained as confidential information and that prohibit any reverse-engineering of that code.

We believe that our patents are important to our business.  We also believe that, in some areas, the improvement of existing products and the development of new products, as well as reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how, are important in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage.  We believe, to a certain extent, that the value of our products and services are dependent upon our proprietary software, hardware, and other technology remaining trade secrets and/or subject to copyright protection.  Generally, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees, subcontractors, and certain customers and other business partners.  Please see Item 3. — Legal Proceedings of this report for more information.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING 

We have a skilled and multi-disciplined engineering organization that develops our products and services.  Our in-house technological capability includes a wide range of skills required to develop systems, hardware, software, and firmware used in our products and services.  In addition, we have pioneered numerous advances in the area of wireless communication systems, techniques and methodologies, television broadcasting, video placeshifting, video copy protection, and digital video recording. 

With respect to hardware development, we have skill sets that include complex digital designs, radio frequency and intermediate frequency analog designs, advanced application-specific integrated circuit designs, and sophisticated consumer and system level packaging designs.  We also have extensive experience in developing products for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing for the consumer industry, including satellite TV set-top receivers and dual mode satellite and wireless handsets. 

As a complement to our hardware development, we have extensive experience in designing reliable, real time, embedded software systems as part of our communication systems and services offerings.  For example, our broadband product line for the enterprise market supports an extensive range of protocols for data communications.  Our engineers have also developed many large turnkey systems for our customers by designing the overall solution, implementing the various subsystems, deploying the entire network and user terminals, integrating and verifying the operational system, and ultimately training the customers’ technicians and operators.

Costs incurred in research and development activities generally are expensed as incurred. A significant portion of our research and development costs are incurred in connection with the specific requirements of a customer’s order. In such instances, the amounts for these customer funded development efforts are included in cost of sales. Cost of sales includes research and development costs incurred in connection with customer’s orders of approximately $67.8 million, $59.2 million and $68.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  In addition, we incurred other research and development expenses of approximately $76.0 million, $78.3 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA AND TRANSACTIONS WITH MAJOR CUSTOMERS

For principal geographic area data and transactions with major customers for 2016, 2015 and 2014, see Note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report.  See Item 1A. — Risk Factors for information regarding risks related to our foreign operations.
EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,000 employees and generally consider relations with them to be good.  Other than approximately 170 of our employees located in Italy and Brazil, none are represented by a union.  Approximately 1,800 of our employees are expected to transfer to DISH Network upon consummation of the Share Exchange.
