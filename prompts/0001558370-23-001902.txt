ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our company 
We are a new type of pharmaceutical company committed to developing and expanding access to innovative medicines for some of the most prevalent disease areas, including cancer and immune-inflammatory conditions. Launched in January 2020, we are leveraging cutting-edge science, technology and strategic partnerships with stakeholders from across the healthcare system toward the goal of increasing access for patients around the world.
The EQRx business opportunity 
Thanks to the powerful tools and technologies of the 21st century, including genome sequencing, proteomics, and genomics, to name a few, society has made tremendous progress in elucidating the drivers of many diseases at the molecular mechanism level. It is now possible to engineer novel molecules around well-known targets, as evidenced by the increase in innovative but overlapping drug candidates with their own intellectual property. With the proliferation of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning and technology-enabled experimental drug discovery engineering platforms, this trend is expected to further accelerate, leading to more rapid engineering of molecules against disease targets, reducing expensive failure rates and lowering costs of early development. 
For example, in oncology these tools and technologies have improved the ability to identify specific genetic mutations that “drive” cancer cells. These insights have generated more interest in and a higher utilization of combination therapies to address the varied and evolving drivers of the disease. To enable this paradigm shift, the component therapies within combination regimens will likely need to have low toxicity and drug-drug interaction profiles, so patients can tolerate treatment and have the opportunity to benefit from the potential to improve clinical outcomes.
This creates opportunity for EQRx. By coupling known mechanisms of action with the latest drug engineering technologies, we believe we can develop and deliver differentiated, patent-protected, fast follower programs that are potent towards known mechanisms of action and have the safety and combinability profile to be used alongside other agents. An important criterion for inclusion in our portfolio is an understanding of the mechanism of action and the underlying biology of the disease, which we believe may result in a higher probability of technical success versus the historical industry success rate.
Today, we have more than 10 programs in our pipeline, including clinical, preclinical and drug engineering targets for the treatment of oncology and immune-inflammatory conditions. We will continue to evaluate our pipeline and opportunities to add to it by in-licensing additional programs, leveraging our drug engineering collaborations and exploring combination partnerships. There is no guarantee that we will identify suitable assets to grow our pipeline, and, even if we do, we may not be able to acquire rights to these assets or develop them successfully to achieve our targets. Further, our preclinical and early-stage discovery programs may not ever result in clinical development candidates.

Select late-stage clinical programs include:

● | Aumolertinib (EQ143) is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in-licensed from Hansoh (Shanghai) Healthtech Co., LTD and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company LTD (collectively, Hansoh) in 2020. Aumolertinib has demonstrated clinical activity in late-stage clinical trials in initial treatment of patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including positive Phase 3 results, and in treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have developed resistance after treatment with a first-generation EGFR inhibitor. As of December 31, 2022, clinical trials of aumolertinib sponsored by Hansoh have treated over 1,200 patients in China. Aumolertinib obtained marketing approval in China in 2020 for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, who have progressed on or after prior EGFR TKI therapy, and in 2021 for the first-line (1L) treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR sensitizing mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations). In addition, aumolertinib is currently being investigated in multiple Phase 3 clinical trials in China. In August 2022, we initiated a U.S.-led, randomized, three-arm, open-label, Phase 3b clinical trial (TREBLE) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aumolertinib with chemotherapy, versus osimertinib, versus aumolertinib for the 1L treatment of EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC.

● | Sugemalimab (EQ165, also known as CS1001) is an anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody, in-licensed from CStone Pharmaceuticals (CStone) in 2020. Sugemalimab has demonstrated clinical activity and positive Phase 3 results in broadly defined Stage III and Stage IV NSCLC patient populations and most recently in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (GC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). As of December 31, 2022, clinical trials sponsored by CStone have treated over 1,700 patients with sugemalimab either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies, and sugemalimab has obtained marketing approval in China for the 1L treatment of patients with Stage IV NSCLC and as consolidation therapy for patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC. In addition, sugemalimab is currently being investigated in a variety of solid tumors and lymphomas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities in several geographies. Our marketing authorization applications for aumolertinib for the 1L treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations and those with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC were accepted for review by the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for a Great Britain license in June 2022 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for a European Union-wide license in December 2022. Our marketing authorization applications for sugemalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the 1L treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC were accepted for review by the MHRA for a Great Britain license in December 2022 and by the EMA for a European Union-wide license in February 2023. Based on discussions with the FDA, in November 2022 and February 2023, we determined not to seek regulatory approval for sugemalimab for the treatment of Stage IV NSCLC or ENKTL, respectively, in the United States.



Other programs in our pipeline include clinical, preclinical and discovery stage assets in both oncology and immune-inflammatory conditions: 

● | Nofazinlimab (EQ176, also known as CS1003) is an anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody and is being evaluated in an ongoing global Phase 3 trial for the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer Additionally, nofazinlimab has received orphan drug designation (ODD) from the FDA for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | EQ121 is a novel, highly selective Janus kinase-1 (JAK-1) inhibitor that has currently completed Phase 1 where an extended-release formulation, suitable for once-daily dosing, was identified for future trials. Additionally, EQ121 is being evaluated in multiple Phase 1b and 2 trials in China for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional disclosed and undisclosed preclinical and drug engineering programs targeting large oncology and immune-inflammatory indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our current clinical-stage assets were each in-licensed from biopharma companies around the world, Additionally, we have entered into multiple drug engineering collaborations with leading technology-enabled experimental platforms, machine-learning computational platforms and physics-based computational platforms, to efficiently engineer molecules against well-specified targets for important chronic and life-threatening conditions. We have existing collaborations with Aurigene, Exscientia and Relay Therapeutics, for the engineering of small molecule therapeutics; AbCellera for the engineering of antibody-based therapeutics; Absci for the engineering of protein-based therapeutics; and Evotec for the engineering of multi-modality therapeutics. 
Our commercialization strategy
We are tailoring our commercialization approach for different markets to deliver our programs, if approved, to patients in those markets. For each region and program, we will evaluate and determine our optimal mix of direct efforts and strategic partnerships, as well as our pricing strategy. These decisions will be made based on the strength of our data for the applicable program, the competitive dynamics of the specific therapeutic class, the region-specific market characteristics and our internal capabilities.
Within the United States, we have announced that we will adopt a market-based pricing strategy for aumolertinib and lerociclib, if approved. We intend to work closely with stakeholders across the value chain, including multiple categories of payers and health systems, including integrated delivery networks, regional and national payers and PBMs, in order to create access to our programs, if approved. Currently, we are working with our existing partners to leverage their data, capabilities and services to support our clinical development activities, and we are exploring opportunities to further expand collaboration in the future.
In Europe, we continue to work through the regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) processes and explore ways to commercialize efficiently and effectively. As an example, we have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for a population health partnership with the National Health Service in England, with the intention to enter into a long-term, strategic partnership to secure patient access to our pipeline of innovative oncology medicines, contingent on regulatory approval by the MHRA and a positive health technology assessment recommendation by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). In addition, two of our oncology programs, aumolertinib and sugemalimab, have been granted Innovation Passport designation through the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) from the ILAP partner organizations including the MHRA, NICE, Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) and The All Wales Therapeutics and Toxicology Centre (AWTTC), which provides the potential for an accelerated marketing authorization application assessment as well as rolling review and a continuous benefit-risk assessment.
Outside of the United States and Europe, we are exploring ways to bring access to our medicines, if approved, either directly or through partnerships. As an example, we have a distribution agreement with Abdul Latif Jameel 



Health, part of the internationally diversified family business Abdul Latif Jameel. Through this agreement, Abdul Latif Jameel Health is our regulatory and commercial partner, subject to approval, for aumolertinib and sugemalimab in selected markets throughout the Middle East region, as well as in Turkey and all of Africa.

Our late-stage clinical programs
Aumolertinib (EQ143) for treatment of 1L and adjuvant EGFR-mutated NSCLC
We are developing aumolertinib, a novel, irreversible, third generation EGFR TKI for the treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In July 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights to aumolertinib globally, excluding Greater China, from Hansoh. Hansoh retains rights to aumolertinib in Greater China, where it is approved by the National Medical Products Association (NMPA) of China for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, who have progressed on or after prior EGFR TKI therapy, and for the 1L treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR sensitive mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations). Based on the clinical data generated to date with aumolertinib, recent pivotal trial results, and commercial approval in China, we believe that aumolertinib has the potential to expand treatment options for patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC. 
As of December 31, 2022, aumolertinib clinical trials, sponsored by Hansoh and conducted in China, have treated over 1,200 patients including: 

● | The pivotal, Phase 3 randomized trial (AENEAS) in the initial treatment of Chinese patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations (n=429). The trial compared aumolertinib 110 mg once daily (n=214) to gefitinib 250 mg once daily (n=215). The trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). These data supported the approval by the NMPA of China for the 1L treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR sensitive mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The pivotal, Phase 2 open-label, single-arm trial (APOLLO) in Chinese patients with metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had developed resistance to a first-generation EGFR inhibitor (EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC) (n=244). The trial met its primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR), and aumolertinib was well-tolerated. These data supported the approval by the NMPA of China for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or after prior EGFR TKI therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 1 trials consisting of two components: a Phase 1a dose escalation phase (n=26) and a Phase 1b dose-expansion phase (n=94), with patients in China and the United States. The results demonstrated predictable pharmacokinetics (PK) and established the basis for the clinical activity and tolerability profile subsequently confirmed in pivotal trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In February 2021, Hansoh disclosed topline results of its Phase 3 AENEAS trial which demonstrated that aumolertinib met its primary endpoint of improvement of PFS in 1L treatment of patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), ORR, duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR) and depth in response (DepOR). Results from the trial, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021 Annual Meeting and subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in May 2022, demonstrated that aumolertinib has the potential to provide significant benefits as initial treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Highlights from the trial include: 





● | The median PFS, as evaluated by investigators, was estimated at 19.3 months for aumolertinib versus 9.9 months for gefitinib with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (Log-rank p-value < 0.0001). The effect of aumolertinib on OS will be available at a future timepoint when these data are mature.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At a one-year landmark, 69% of patients treated with aumolertinib were free of disease progression or death compared to 46% of patients treated with gefitinib.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvement in PFS in patients who received aumolertinib over gefitinib was observed across relevant subgroups of patients, including those with brain metastases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aumolertinib was generally well-tolerated, and adverse events (AEs) resulting in patients temporarily stopping or discontinuing treatment were less common with aumolertinib than with gefitinib.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drug-related AEs were reported in 197 (92%) and 206 (96%) patients treated with aumolertinib or gefitinib, respectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drug-related serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 9 (4%) and 24 (11%) patients treated with aumolertinib or gefitinib, respectively. Drug-related SAEs observed in ≥2 patients in either group were less commonly observed with aumolertinib versus gefitinib treatment: hepatic function abnormal (2 patients or 0.9% versus 9 patients or 4.2%), alanine aminotransferase increased (0 patients versus 4 patients or 1.9%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (0 patient versus 4 patients or 1.9%) and drug-induced liver injury (0 patient versus 2 patients or 0.9%).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The table below describes the commonly reported AEs (≥20% of patients, all causality). In terms of AEs related to the inhibition of wild-type EGFR, both rash (50 patients or 23% versus 89 patients or 41%) and diarrhea (35 patients or 16% versus 77 patients or 36%) were less commonly observed with aumolertinib versus gefitinib. Conversely, elevations in creatine phosphokinase were more common with aumolertinib (76 patients or 35% versus 20 patients or 9.3%) but did not lead to rhabdomyolysis in any patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​An additional analysis from the Phase 3 AENEAS trial in EGFR-mutated NSCLC was presented at the ASCO 2022 Annual Meeting demonstrating that aumolertinib reduced the risk of central nervous system (CNS) progression as a 1L treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had baseline CNS metastases by 68% as compared to gefitinib (29.0 vs. 8.3 months; HR=0.319; 95% CI, 0.176-




0.580; P<0.0001). In patients who had baseline CNS target lesions, the median PFS was 29.0 months for aumolertinib vs. 8.3 months for gefitinib (HR=0.268; 95% CI, 0.119-0.605; P=0.0007). The safety profile for aumolertinib in this patient population was consistent with that reported previously for aumolertinib in the overall patient population.
In August 2021, we initiated an open-label clinical trial to evaluate the comparative PK of aumolertinib following oral single dose administration in adult healthy volunteers of different racial and ethnic populations, for the purpose of establishing whether aumolertinib PK are sensitive to ethnicity. We enrolled 45 participants to this trial in the United States and New Zealand and completed the trial in December 2021. This trial demonstrated comparable PK in non-Chinese healthy volunteers with a diverse background. 
Currently, aumolertinib is being investigated in multiple ongoing clinical trials. In addition to the aforementioned Phase 3 AENEAS trial in NSCLC, these trials include: 

● | A Phase 3b trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib with chemotherapy, versus osimertinib, versus aumolertinib for the 1L treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=500). This U.S.-led, randomized, three-arm, open-label trial was initiated in August 2022 and is sponsored by EQRx. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by a blinded independent review committee. The secondary endpoints include OS, PFS as assessed by investigators, ORR, DCR, DepOR, and DoR.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in patients with surgically resected Stage II-IIIB EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=192), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS) as assessed by an independent review committee. The secondary endpoints include DFS assessed by investigators and OS.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib as a maintenance therapy in patients with Stage III unresectable NSCLC (n=150), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigators, CNS PFS, OS, ORR, DoR, DCR, and time to death/distant metastasis (TTDM).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy in non-canonical EGFR mutations (n=220), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigators, ORR, DoR, DCR, DepOR and OS.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib in combination with platinum-containing dual-agent agents vs. aumolertinib as 1L for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations (n=624), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The secondary endpoints are ORR, DoR, DCR, DepOR, PFS and OS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 1 trial evaluating the PK and safety of aumolertinib in participants with severe hepatic impairment and in matched healthy adults (n=12), being conducted in the United States and sponsored by EQRx.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are in ongoing discussions with multiple regulatory authorities and expect these trials to support the expansion of access to aumolertinib globally for the initial treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Our marketing authorization applications for aumolertinib for the 1L treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations and those with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC were accepted for review by the MHRA for a Great Britain license in June 2022 and by the EMA for a European Union-wide license in December 2022. 



Lerociclib (EQ132) for HR±/HER2- breast cancer 
We are developing lerociclib, a novel, oral, potent, and selective small molecule cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor for use in combination with other targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with hormone receptor positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC). In July 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights for lerociclib globally, excluding the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan), from G1 Therapeutics (G1), a U.S.-based biotechnology company. Genor Biopharma (Genor) holds the development and commercialization rights to lerociclib within the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan). Based on the clinical data generated to date, we believe that lerociclib has the potential to expand treatment options for patients with hormone-driven cancers, including breast cancer and endometrial cancer.
Currently, lerociclib is being evaluated in the following clinical trials:

● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with fulvestrant in subjects with HR+/HER2- locally advanced breast cancer or mBC who have progressed on prior endocrine therapy (planned n=270), being conducted in China and sponsored by Genor. The primary endpoint is PFS, and key secondary endpoints are OS, ORR, DoR, DCR, CBR.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with letrozole in subjects with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or mBC who have not received prior systemic antitumor therapy (planned n=280-286), being conducted in China and sponsored by Genor.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 2 trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with standard endocrine therapy for the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (planned n=100), being conducting in the United States, Europe and Mexico and sponsored by EQRx. The study will consist of patients who were previously untreated for metastatic disease (1L) or have progressed on prior endocrine therapy (2L). The primary endpoints are incidence of AEs and SAEs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 1b trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with letrozole in previously untreated patients with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (planned n=10), being conducted in China and sponsored by Genor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase ½ trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with fulvestrant in HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (n=110), being conducted in the United Kingdom, Georgia, Moldova, and Bulgaria, and sponsored by G1.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preliminary results from a Phase ½ trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with osimertinib in EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=36), conducted in the United States, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, and sponsored by G1, were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2019. The trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity and identify the dose and schedule for future trials of lerociclib. These results demonstrated a tolerable safety profile for lerociclib when used in combination with osimertinib. No lerociclib-related SAEs were reported, and the most common lerociclib-related treatment emergent adverse event (TEAEs) were neutropenia and diarrhea. 
Preliminary Phase 1b results were presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and further dose escalation and expansion results were originally presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). The final analysis of such results was presented at ESMO Congress 2020. Highlights from the trial included:

● | Continuously dosed, twice-daily lerociclib, in combination with fulvestrant, was well tolerated with relatively low rates of gastrointestinal AEs, including no grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal AEs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lerociclib could be dosed continuously without need for interruption for management of neutropenia.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Coadministration of fulvestrant had minimal impact on the PK of lerociclib.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The clinical activity data were consistent with those from other approved CDK4/6 inhibitors when used in combination with fulvestrant.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taken together, these results demonstrate the potentially differentiated clinical profile of lerociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus currently marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors for the treatment of HR+ cancers, including breast cancer, and suggest that lerociclib can be administered without need for dose interruption due to neutropenia, one of the main toxicities associated with CDK4/6 inhibition. Some CDK4/6 therapies require frequent blood testing for neutropenia, and lerociclib has the potential to offer fewer office visits and blood draws, improving the experience for patients and reducing the burden on physician offices and costs to the healthcare system.
We expect data from these trials to support regulatory filings for lerociclib for the treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Additionally, we are exploring opportunities in additional indications within and beyond hormone-driven cancers, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. For example, we plan to initiate a multiregional Phase 3 clinical trial for lerociclib in combination with letrozole for the first-line treatment of advanced endometrial cancer in the first half of 2023. 
Sugemalimab (EQ165) for NSCLC and other cancers 
We are developing sugemalimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, for the treatment of NSCLC, with Phase 3 clinical trials in both metastatic (Stage IV) and locally advanced/unresectable (Stage III) disease, as well as additional solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In October 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights to sugemalimab globally, excluding Greater China, from CStone. Pfizer, Inc. holds the exclusive development and commercialization rights to sugemalimab within Greater China, where it is approved by the NMPA of China for 1L treatment of patients with Stage IV NSCLC and as consolidation therapy for patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC. Sugemalimab has demonstrated an overall survival benefit in patients with Stage IV (metastatic NSCLC) and progression-free survival benefit in broadly defined Stage III NSCLC after concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy. Based on clinical data generated to date and recent positive pivotal trial results in gastric and esophageal cancer, we believe that sugemalimab has the potential to expand treatment options for patients with Stage IV NSCLC and other solid tumors. 
As of December 31, 2022, sugemalimab clinical trials sponsored by CStone in China, including but not limited to those summarized below, have treated over 1,700 patients including: 

● | The Phase 3 double-blind, randomized GEMSTONE-302 trial evaluating the addition of sugemalimab to platinum-based chemotherapy as an initial treatment for Stage IV squamous or non-squamous NSCLC. The GEMSTONE-302 trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS for sugemalimab plus chemotherapy (n=320) as compared to chemotherapy alone (n=159). The benefit of adding sugemalimab to chemotherapy was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level or pathologic subtype of NSCLC (squamous versus non-squamous), and the tolerability profile was acceptable. In a planned interim analysis, data showed that the GEMSTONE-302 study met its pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall survival.

● | The Phase 3 double-blind, randomized GEMSTONE-303 trial evaluating the addition of sugemalimab to platinum-based chemotherapy as 1L therapy for patients with unresectable/locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥5% and HER2-negative (n=479). The study met one of its primary endpoints of improvement in PFS for sugemalimab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy and placebo. Overall survival results are still pending. The safety profile was consistent with previous findings across different diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Phase 3 double-blind, randomized GEMSTONE-304 trial evaluating the addition of sugemalimab to platinum-based chemotherapy as 1L therapy for patients with unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (n=540). The study met both primary endpoints and demonstrated a significant benefit in PFS and OS for sugemalimab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy and placebo. The safety profile was consistent with previous findings across different diseases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Phase 2 single-arm GEMSTONE-201 trial, conducted in the United States and China, evaluating the activity and tolerability of sugemalimab in the treatment of adult patients with R/R ENKTL (n=80). The GEMSTONE-201 trial met its primary endpoint of ORR. In that trial, sugemalimab demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile, with no new safety signals observed.

In August 2020, our partner, CStone, first announced that its Phase 3 GEMSTONE-302 trial met its primary endpoint in Stage IV NSCLC. The most recent data, as of November 2021, including statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival results, were presented at the 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting. The final PFS analysis was published in January 2022 in The Lancet Oncology. Highlights from the GEMSTONE-302 trial include: 

● | Sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy met the primary endpoint of improvement in PFS, as evaluated by investigators as compared with chemotherapy and placebo at the time of the pre-specified event-driven analysis. In a planned interim analysis, sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy met its key secondary endpoint of prolongation of OS and the benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level or pathologic subtype of NSCLC.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other key secondary endpoints included PFS as assessed by an independent review committee, PFS as assessed by investigators in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, ORR, DoR, and safety.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The findings showed that sugemalimab plus chemotherapy in Stage IV NSCLC patients resulted in statistically significant improvement in PFS. The median PFS was 9.0 months for the sugemalimab and chemotherapy combination group versus 4.9 months for the chemotherapy and placebo group with a hazard ratio of 0.48 (Log-rank p-value < 0.0001).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related AEs were reported in nearly all patients in both groups with 317 (99%) and 153 (96%) patients in the sugemalimab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Treatment-related severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs were reported in 182 (57%) and 91 (57%) of patients in the sugemalimab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy groups, respectively.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 73 (23%) and 31 (20%) patients in the sugemalimab/chemotherapy and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Commonly reported (≥2% of patients in either group) treatment-related SAEs included the following (sugemalimab/chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, respectively): anemia (3.4% versus 3.1%), pneumonia (3.1% versus 4.4%), platelet count decreased (3.1% versus 2.5%), and neutrophil count decreased (1.9% versus 2.5%).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In May 2021, our partner, CStone, first announced that its Phase 3 GEMSTONE-301 trial met its primary endpoint in Stage III NSCLC. This initial data was presented at the ESMO Congress 2021 and was published in January 2022 in The Lancet Oncology. The final PFS analysis, with data cut-off of March 2022, was presented at the 2022 World Conference on Lung Cancer. Highlights from the GEMSTONE-301 trial include: 

● | Sugemalimab met the primary endpoint of improvement of PFS, as assessed by an independent review committee compared to placebo at the time of the pre-specified interim analysis. Key secondary endpoints included OS, PFS as assessed by investigators, ORR, DoR, and time to death/distant metastasis (TTDM).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The findings showed that sugemalimab as a consolidation therapy in Stage III NSCLC patients without disease progression after chemoradiotherapy resulted in statistically significant improvement in PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The median PFS was estimated at 10.5 months for the sugemalimab group versus 6.2 months for the placebo group with a hazard ratio of 0.65 (Log-rank p-value = 0.0012).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The clinical benefit of sugemalimab as a consolidation therapy in Stage III NSCLC patients without disease progression after chemoradiotherapy was observed regardless of whether patients received concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy prior to sugemalimab.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sugemalimab was generally well-tolerated, and no new safety signals were identified.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related AEs were reported in 200 (78.4%) and 81 (64.3%) patients in the sugemalimab and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-related severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs were reported in 29 (11.4%) and 7 (5.6%) patients in the sugemalimab and placebo groups, respectively. Commonly reported (≥ 2% of patients in either group) treatment-related severe AEs included the following (sugemalimab versus placebo, respectively): immune-mediated pneumonitis (2.4% versus 0) and pneumonia (2.4% versus 0.8%).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 44 (17.3%) and 11(8.7%) patients in the sugemalimab and placebo groups, respectively.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe the current results of the GEMSTONE-302 trial will advance the clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors and improve the availability of treatment for patients with Stage IV NSCLC. Our marketing authorization applications for sugemalimab in combination with chemotherapy for the 1L treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC were accepted for review by the MHRA for a Great Britain license in December 2022 and by the EMA for a European Union-wide license in February 2023. Based on discussions with the FDA, in November 2022 and February 2023, we determined not to seek regulatory approval for sugemalimab for the treatment of Stage IV NSCLC or ENKTL, respectively, in the United States. Additional data from the GEMSTONE-301, -303, and -304 trials may expand treatment options beyond Stage IV NSCLC in the future.



Additional clinical-stage assets
Nofazinlimab (EQ176) for advanced solid tumors 
We are developing nofazinlimab, a novel, anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. In July 2020, the FDA granted nofazinlimab ODD for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in October 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights to nofazinlimab globally, excluding Greater China, from CStone. CStone retains rights to nofazinlimab (CS1003) in Greater China. 
Our partner, CStone, reported that its Phase 1 trial in China (n=19) demonstrated that nofazinlimab monotherapy was well-tolerated at 60mg and 200mg Q3W with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) observed and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) not reached. CStone’s Phase 1b trial (n=20) evaluated nofazinlimab in combination with lenvatinib for the treatment of HCC and demonstrated an ORR of 45% and median PFS of 10.4 months. Currently, a global, randomized, Phase 3 trial is evaluating nofazinlimab in combination with lenvatinib in initial treatment of patients with advanced unresectable HCC (n=525) and completed enrollment in March 2022. The trial is being conducted in multiple countries, including China, European countries, and the United States, and is sponsored by CStone. The co-primary endpoints are PFS, as assessed by an independent review committee, and OS. The key secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigators, ORR, DCR, DoR, and time to progression (TTP). 
EQ121 for immune-inflammatory conditions 
We are developing EQ121, a highly selective, novel, JAK-1 inhibitor for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In April 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights to EQ121 globally, excluding Greater China, from Lynk Pharmaceutical (Hangzhou) Co., Ltd. (Lynk Pharmaceuticals). Lynk Pharmaceuticals retains rights to EQ121 (LNK-207) in Greater China. 
We have completed multiple Phase 1 trials in Australia and New Zealand, which included three substudies. In the first substudy, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EQ121 following oral single and multiple ascending dose administration of the immediate-release formulation in adult healthy volunteers; the key secondary endpoint was to characterize the PK of EQ121 following single and multiple ascending dose administration. In the second substudy, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple doses of EQ121 in adults with rheumatoid arthritis who were on a stable oral methotrexate (MTX) regimen; the key secondary endpoints included evaluation of the effect of MTX on the PK of EQ121 and the effect of EQ121 on the PK of MTX. The second substudy has since been terminated due to our deprioritization of the rheumatoid arthritis indication. The third substudy was designed to compare the relative bioavailability of the immediate-release capsule of EQ121 with multiple extended-release formulations and to evaluate the food effect of the extended relation (ER) formulation selected for further development in healthy volunteers. An extended-release formulation, suitable for once-daily dosing, has been identified and characterized, this formulation will be utilized in Phase 2. Lynk Pharmaceuticals has also conducted a Phase 1 trial in China in healthy subjects, and is evaluating EQ121 in two Phase 1b trials in rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis patients, respectively. Multiple Phase 2 trials in China for the treatment ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis are also ongoing.
​



Preclinical programs and drug engineering collaborations 
In addition to our five clinical-stage programs, our early-stage pipeline includes several disclosed and undisclosed preclinical and drug engineering programs. These programs are focused on oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases that are expected to have large market opportunities. 
We have entered into multiple drug engineering collaborations with cutting-edge technology platform companies including those with technology enabled experimental platforms, machine-learning computational platforms and physics-based computational platforms. Select drug engineering collaborations include Exscientia, AbCellera, Relay Therapeutics, Absci, Evotec and Aurigene. These are multi-year, potentially multi-target collaborations intended to accelerate the engineering of therapeutic drug candidates against selective targets across a range of therapeutic areas, thereby further expanding the breadth of our pipeline of novel therapies when combined with our internal drug development efforts.
We will carefully evaluate additional opportunities to collaborate on additional drug discovery efforts to cost-effectively create new molecules. We believe these drug engineering collaborations have the potential to accelerate the growth of our catalog of medicines. We do not currently have, and may never have, any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and so we may never become profitable. We also note that the drug development process is inherently uncertain and cannot be fully de-risked, and there is no guarantee that the clinical trials we may conduct in the future will provide us with positive or actionable data that will facilitate efficient clinical development. For more details regarding these and other risks that are material to our business, operations and future share price, please see Item 1A “Risk Factors”.
​
Licenses and collaborations
Material license agreements
A key component of our strategy is to build our pipeline. We plan to do this using multiple strategies, including entering into agreements to in-license assets. We believe that our license and collaboration agreements for aumolertinib (EQ143), lerociclib (EQ132) and sugemalimab (EQ165) are material agreements in light of our current near-term business plans and development strategy. Our agreement with CStone also gives us rights to nofazinlimab (EQ176, also known as CS1003), an anti-PD-1 antibody that is in an ongoing Phase 3 trial for the treatment of liver cancer patients, and our agreement with Lynk Pharmaceuticals for EQ121 further support our near-term business plans and development strategy.

Competition
The biopharma industry is highly competitive and dynamic, driven by rapidly advancing technologies and resulting in a proliferation of assets within drug classes. Our pipeline faces competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, drug engineering platforms, academic institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future. 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with larger and more established companies. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and in patient accrual to clinical trials, and acquiring programs complementary to our pipeline, among others. 
Our commercial potential could be negatively impacted if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or are more convenient. Additionally, due to historical lack of transparency of branded drug prices, we may not be aware of the financial or other incentives that our competitors are offering their customers or how their customer value proposition compares to ours. 
Intellectual property
We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by our or our partners’ pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our (and our partners’, as applicable) ability to obtain, maintain, enforce, and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions, and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our (and our partners’ as applicable) success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims, if granted. However, our (and our partners’, as applicable) pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we (and our partners, as applicable) may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products.

Trade secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect our trade secrets and know-how by entering into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and partners. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us be kept confidential during and for some period of time after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties. 
​



Government regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations (CROs), clinical investigators, and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), will be required to comply with the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals of drugs and biologics and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and biologics under the FD&C Act and the Public Health Service Act (the PHSA), as amended, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval, or any other requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution. 
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. For drug product candidates regulated under the FD&C Act, the FDA must approve a New Drug Application (NDA) and for biologic product candidates regulated under the FD&C Act and PHSA, the FDA must approve a Biologics License Application (BLA) before a product may be legally marketed in the United States. The process for NDAs and BLAs is similar and generally involves the following: 

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval or pre-license inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA, unless a waiver applies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical studies and clinical trials for drugs and biologics
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, a product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. 
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies related to the product. The IND also includes the results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within such 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. The FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the hold, and the sponsor must resolve any identified deficiencies before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A clinical hold can also be imposed once a trial has already begun, thereby halting the trial until the deficiencies articulated by the FDA are corrected. 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in the relevant clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring the product candidate’s safety and evaluating its effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (DSMB), which provides authorization for whether a study may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of the product candidate’s efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including results for clinical trials other than Phase 1 investigations, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. 
A sponsor that wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA will generally not consider the results of the trial in support of an NDA or BLA unless (i) the trial was well-designed and well-conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, including requirements for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of the clinical trial in a way that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and 




well-being of trial subjects are protected, and (ii) the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection if deemed necessary. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data unless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through other appropriate means. 
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap. 

• | Phase 1 — Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 — Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve the administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 — Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve the administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.

In March 2022, the FDA released final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts is included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce development costs and time. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA or BLA approval. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected AEs, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate, and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 




Expanded access
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application. 
There is no requirement for a company to provide expanded access to its investigational products. However, if a company decides to make its investigational product available for expanded access, the FDA reviews each request for expanded access and determines if treatment may proceed. Expanded access may be appropriate when all of the following criteria apply: the patient has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment, and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated; and providing the investigational product for the requested use will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the expanded access use. 
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. While there is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients under the Right to Try Act, the 21st Century Cures Act requires the manufacturer to develop a policy for evaluating and responding to patient requests for expanded access. This policy must be made public and readily available and include company contact information and expected response times. 
U.S. marketing approval for drugs and biologics
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications. A BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety, purity, and potency for the requested indications. The marketing application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. The FDA must approve an NDA or BLA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA or BLA. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facilities in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held and meets standards, including cGMP requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s continued identity, strength, quality, and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA 




or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or BLA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. 
Further, under the PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) if it believes that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS can include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies like medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, special monitoring, or other risk-minimization tools. 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, but the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue a complete response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing a complete response letter, the FDA may require additional clinical or preclinical testing or recommend other actions, such as requests for additional information or clarification, that the applicant might take in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product in the United States with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant ODD to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in 




the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, although companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees. 
If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product candidate is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Rare pediatric disease designation and priority review vouchers
Under the FD&C Act, the FDA incentivizes the development of products that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease”, defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher (PRV). A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA or BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA or BLA. Moreover, a sponsor that chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of its marketing application if it requests such a voucher in its original marketing application and meets all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026. 
Expedited development and review programs for drugs and biologics
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, BTD, priority review and accelerated approval. The purpose of these programs is to expedite the development or review of important new drugs and biologics to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit. 
A new drug or biologic is eligible for fast track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application. 




In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for BTD if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. BTD provides all the features of fast track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient product development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and the FDA’s organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with fast track or BTD, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including priority review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review once an NDA or BLA is submitted, if the product that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. 
Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug or biologic intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that generally provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over available treatments and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, adequate and well-controlled additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that post-approval confirmatory trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after accelerated approval is granted and the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a product or an indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial is not conducted with due diligence or fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. FDORA also requires sponsors to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of its confirmatory trials, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication. 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review, or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, BTD, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, although they may expedite the development or review process. 
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain NDA and BLA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor that is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric 




studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted, except that PREA will apply to an original NDA or BLA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug or biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. 
A product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs and biologics
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of AEs with the product, complying with promotional and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved label (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but it does impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by company employees but also by agents of the company or those speaking on the company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Promotional materials for approved drugs and biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication, and may be required to be reviewed in advance in certain circumstances such as for products that receive accelerated approval. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement, which may be denied or may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on sponsors and their CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that a sponsor may use. Additionally, manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug and biologic products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program user fee for any marketed product. 




The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among others: 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Health Care Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United States patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of a drug or biologic, some United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date, and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. An NDA or BLA applicant may apply for restoration of the patent term for its currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond a patent’s current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FD&C Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is considered a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FD&C Act also provides for three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the 




preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
​
United States biosimilars and exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biologic product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars in the United States. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biologic product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product be biosimilar to the reference product and that product demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference product. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of its product. In addition, the first biologic submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product is eligible for a period of exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the same reference product for any condition of use. The FDA may approve multiple “first” interchangeable products so long as they are all approved on the same first day of marketing. This exclusivity period, which may be shared amongst multiple first interchangeable products, lasts for the shortest of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, and (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. Products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA may be readily substituted by pharmacies, and such substitution is governed by state pharmacy law. 
Other regulatory matters
Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion, and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also potentially subject to federal, state, and local consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which we may be subject. Additionally, the activities associated with the commercialization of product candidates is subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and government agencies. 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage, and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements may subject companies to legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including 




government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defended against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales, or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
Changes in statutes, regulations, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional recordkeeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
Other healthcare laws
Coverage and reimbursement
Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations (HMOs), determine which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on these governments or payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payers is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. 
Because there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage, reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS determines whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payers tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Further, due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, millions of individuals have lost employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products in the United States. 
Payers determining reimbursement level consider multiple factors, including whether the product is: 

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | safe, effective, and medically necessary;
--+------------------------------------------


• | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


• | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that pharmaceutical manufacturers provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the U.S. government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs and by any future relaxation of laws that currently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the 




completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union have different price structures than in the United States, and generally prices in the European Union tend to be significantly lower than those in the United States. 
​
Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are or may become subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. Our clinical research, sales, marketing, scientific/educational grant programs, collaboration agreements, and partnerships with third-party payers, providers, PBMs, and other entities may be subject to the following laws, each as amended, as applicable: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil monetary penalties. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and providers, prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. The HHS and OIG heavily scrutinize relationships between pharmaceutical companies and persons in a position to generate referrals for or the purchasing of their products such as healthcare providers and PBMs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by, Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;

• | the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-

HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;

• | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which require applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations were extended to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. This information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Failure to disclose required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission;

• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign analogs of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payer. Many U.S. states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-government payers, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals . Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the GDPR (as defined below), which became effective in 2018, also govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements, and, if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. 
Healthcare reform
​
Payers, whether domestic or foreign, or government or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, and those methods are not always specifically adapted for new technologies. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), was enacted in the United States. Among other things, the ACA subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are 




calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. 
​
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, an Executive Order initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. That Executive Order also instructed certain government agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business. 
​
A 2017 Executive Order terminated the cost-sharing subsidies that reimbursed insurers under the ACA concluding that cost-sharing reduction payments (CSRs) to insurance companies required under the ACA had not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it would discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations were made. Several state Attorneys General then filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California. In 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid CSRs for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payers that argued the payments were owed to them. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding that the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula. It is unclear what impact these rulings will have on our business. 
In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility as of 2020 in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. 
In 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865) repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in March  2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional action is taken by Congress. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction began on April 1, 2022 and lasted through June 30, 2022. The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. Additionally, in 




May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Medicare Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. Step therapy is a type of prior authorization for drugs that begins medication for a medical condition with the most preferred drug therapy and progresses to other therapies only if necessary.
​
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices, including the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which among other things, allows for CMS to negotiate prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D, beginning with ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. Medicare Part B provides coverage for certain drugs that are administered by a physician. Medicare Part D generally covers drugs dispensed by a pharmacy. The legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also caps Medicare beneficiaries’ annual out-of-pocket drug expenses at $2,000. The effect of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
​
There have also been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At a federal level, a July 2021 Executive Order affirmed the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the prices that the federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. The FDA released such implementing regulations in September 2020, which went into effect in November  2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. In September 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Because these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates.
​
Further, in November 2020, CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation (MFN) Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologics based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in countries that are members of Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period (2021-2027). The MFN is currently subject to ongoing litigation. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the MFN Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates in Canada and other OECD countries. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional regulation to become effective, the executive branch may seek to reverse or otherwise change these measures. We anticipate the current executive administration and Congress to continue to develop legislative and regulatory measures to control drug costs.
Additionally, in December 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee 




arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed, and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. This deadline was pushed back to January 1, 2027 by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. The Inflation Reduction Act further delayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
Other U.S. environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. 
​
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties, or other sanctions. 
​
Personal data processing 
The collection, use, transfer, disclosure, retention, security, and other processing of personal data (including, without limitation, clinical trial data and other personal health data) (collectively, Process or Processing) may be subject to independent and overlapping data security and privacy regulatory frameworks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These frameworks are evolving and may impose potentially conflicting obligations. For example, in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective May 25, 2018, governs the processing of personal data (EU GDPR), and in the United Kingdom, as of January 1, 2021, the EU GDPR as incorporated into UK law along with the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (UK GDPR, and together with EU GDPR, the GDPR), governs the Processing of personal data. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA or United Kingdom and to companies established outside the EEA or United Kingdom that Process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or United Kingdom or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA or United Kingdom. 
The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers (such as clinical trial sponsors) of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” Processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and United Kingdom to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data (the Third Countries), including the United States. Such transfers of personal data outside of the EEA and United Kingdom are prohibited unless a valid transfer mechanism, as recognized by GDPR (for example, the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)) has been put in place. In the past, companies in the United States were able to rely upon the EU-U.S., UK-U.S., and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks to legitimize data transfers from the EEA, United 




Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Case C-311/18 (Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems or Schrems II) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on the grounds that the Privacy Shield failed to offer adequate protections to EU personal data transferred to the United States. In the same decision, the CJEU deemed that the SCCs are a valid mechanism; however, the CJEU stated that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs (and other similar appropriate transfer safeguards) need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure an “essentially equivalent” level of protection to that guaranteed in the EEA in the destination country where the data importer is based (the Transfer Equivalence Test). If the standard is not met, companies are required to adopt “supplementary measures”. Subsequently, the European Data Protection Board provided guidance on how to achieve these supplementary measures and stated that businesses should avoid or cease transfers of personal data if, in the absence of supplementary measures, equivalent protections cannot be afforded. The European Commission on June 4, 2021 issued new forms of SCCs (replacing the old SCCs adopted under the Data Protection Directive) for data transfers from controllers or processors subject to the GDPR, to controllers or processors established outside the EEA. The United Kingdom has published its own transfer mechanism, the International Data Transfer Agreement and International Data Transfer Addendum (IDTA), which enables transfers from the United Kingdom and has implemented a similar Transfer Equivalence Test. We will be required to carry out Transfer Equivalence Tests and transition to the new form of SCCs and IDTA in relation to our existing agreements with service providers located outside the United Kingdom or EEA (in a country which has not been deemed adequate by the European Commission or United Kingdom) who we utilize for the Processing of UK or EEA personal data and any other parties outside the United Kingdom or EEA who we transfer UK or EEA personal data to. The international transfer obligations under the EEA and United Kingdom data protection regimes will require effort and cost, and may result in us needing to make strategic considerations around where EEA or UK personal data transferred, particularly as the enforcement around GDPR international transfer compliance obligations is currently unclear. Any inability to transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States in compliance with GDPR may impede our ability to conduct trials and may adversely affect our business and financial position. Although the United Kingdom is regarded as a Third Country under the EU GDPR, the European Commission has issued a decision recognizing the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR (the Adequacy Decision) and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EEA to the United Kingdom remain unrestricted. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing. 
The UK government has also now introduced a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (the UK Bill) into the UK legislative process. The aim of the UK Bill is to reform the United Kingdom’s data protection regime following Brexit, as described below. If passed, the final version of the UK Bill may create more dissimilarities between the United Kingdom and EEA data protection regimes and threaten the UK Adequacy Decision from the EU Commission. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall compliance risk. The respective provisions and enforcement of the EU GDPR and UK GDPR may further diverge in the future and create additional regulatory challenges and uncertainties. 
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of EEA Member States may result in fines (up to €20.0 or £17.5 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher). The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Additionally, other countries outside of the EEA and United Kingdom have enacted or are considering enacting similar privacy and data protection laws, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. For example, Brazil enacted the General Data Protection Law, New Zealand enacted the New Zealand Privacy Act, China enacted the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), and Canada introduced the Digital Charter Implementation Act. 
In the United States, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which creates individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered businesses to provide certain disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, as well as the right to request, modify, and delete personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California State Attorney General submitted final regulations for review in June 2020, which were finalized and are now effective. The California State Attorney General has commenced 




enforcement actions against violators as of July 1, 2020. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) amends the CCPA and was passed by California voters in November  2020. The CPRA creates additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information, which became effective on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). Other U.S. states (Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah) have also passed omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. Such state privacy laws may provide exceptions for certain activities involving data collected in the context of clinical trials, such as personal information collected as part of a clinical trial that may be subject to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, pursuant to good clinical practice guidelines issued by the International Council for Harmonisation or pursuant to human subject protection requirements of the United States Food and Drug Administration, as well as personal information governed by California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, and PHI governed by HIPAA. We cannot yet determine the impact the CCPA, CPRA, VDCPA or other such existing or future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. 
In China, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China (SCNPC) promulgated the PIPL, which became effective in November 2021. The PIPL provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The PIPL requires foreign entities who process personal information of persons in China outside of China for the foregoing purposes to establish an agency or designate a representative within China to be responsible for personal information protection, and submit the name and contact information of the such agency or representative to competent authorities. Personal information is broadly defined under the PIPL as all kinds of information relating to any identified or identifiable natural person, whether it is in an electronic form or any other form, excluding any anonymized information. The PIPL also provides that critical information infrastructure operators (CIIOs) and personal information processing entities that process personal information meeting a volume threshold to be set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Additionally, the PIPL provides that any foreign organizations or individuals engaging in personal information processing activities that infringe the rights of Chinese citizens or endanger China’s national security or public interests may be included in a list of entities subject to restrictions or prohibitions on the provision of personal information. Lastly, the PIPL contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB50 million, or 5% of annual revenues from the prior year, and penalties, including that companies found to have violated the PIPL may be ordered to suspend any related activity by competent authorities.
Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations such as HIPAA, the GDPR, the PIPL, and various state laws will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place new or additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with current, evolving and new data protection requirements. This may be an onerous undertaking and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
​
Government regulation of drugs and biologics outside of the United States 
European drug development
Our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements in the European Union. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. 
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation provide that ongoing clinical trials previously authorized under the Directive can remain under the Directive, or 




they can transition to the Regulation. By January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Regulation. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State) and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the European Union. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS); a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all European Union Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. 
European drug review and approval
In the European Union, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). There are two main types of MAs: 

• | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Union and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (EEA). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, including products produced by certain biotechnological process, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (i.e., gene-therapy, somatic cell therapy, or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the European Union, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, which makes the final decision to grant an MA within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SmPC) and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, all of which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment report, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all of the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy. 
European data and market exclusivity
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biologic medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, approved on the basis of a complete, independent data package, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon receipt of an MA and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the European Union, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the European Union until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests, and clinical trials. 
European orphan drug designation and exclusivity
In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that: (1) are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. 
In the European Union, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, an MA may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the MA holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the MA holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process in the European Union. 
European pediatric investigation plan
In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO), and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or 




all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted an MA with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted. 
PRIME designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the MA application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (meaning there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment in the European Union or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage), and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme, facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn. 
Post-approval requirements
Similar to the United States, in the European Union, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the Member States. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. This obligation to appoint a qualified person for pharmacovigilance similarly applies in the United Kingdom. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs). 
All new MA applications must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. 
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising, and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another. 




Much like in the United States by virtue of the Anti-Kickback Statute, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians or other health care professionals to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the United Kingdom despite its departure from the European Union. 
Payments made to physicians or other healthcare professionals in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. 
The aforementioned European Union rules are generally applicable in the EEA. 
Pricing and reimbursement
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so-called health technology assessments (HTAs)) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. 
The European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union Member States may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. Reference pricing used by various European Union Member States and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States) can further reduce prices. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan medicinal products. Inclusion of orphan medicinal products in reimbursement systems tends to focus on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use, and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results-based rules of reimbursement may apply. 
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as Brexit), and the European Union and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and European Union pharmaceutical regulations. At 




present, Great Britain has implemented European Union legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore aligns in many ways with current European Union regulations, but it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union, and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of United Kingdom and European Union pharmaceutical legislation. 
For example, Great Britain is no longer covered by the European Union’s procedures for the grant of centralized MAs (as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered as a Concerned Member State under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate MA is therefore required to market drugs in Great Britain. All medicinal products with a valid centralized MA on January 1, 2021 were automatically converted into Great Britain MAs (unless the MA holder opted out of such a conversion). For a three year period from January 1, 2021, the MHRA, may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new MAs through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to MAs approved in a country in the EEA (although in both cases a an MA will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met) in order to more quickly grant a Great Britain MA. Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the United Kingdom, Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, with the main national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required). 
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-MA orphan designation (as there is in the European Union) in Great Britain, and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an MA application for a United Kingdom or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the European Union, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the European Union, and the prevalence of the condition must be no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in Great Britain). 
In addition, in January 2021, the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) was established in the United Kingdom. ILAP aims to accelerate the time to market and facilitate patient access to certain types of medicinal products in development which target a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition, or where there is a significant patient or public health need in the United Kingdom. The first step in ILAP is receipt of an Innovation Passport, which allows for enhanced engagement with the MHRA and its partner agencies. Once an Innovation Passport has been granted, the next step in the pathway is the preparation of a target development profile (TDP) document by the MHRA and its partner agencies. The TDP sets out the regulatory and development milestones, identifies potential pitfalls and creates a roadmap to achieving early patient access in the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the United Kingdom will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now that has come into effect is not yet known, but the MHRA opened a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation. Such consultation took place from January 17, 2022 until March 14, 2022, and the MHRA is currently analyzing feedback. 




China — HGRAC
According to the Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources, promulgated by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and Ministry of Health (MOH) jointly on June 10, 1998, an additional approval is required for any foreign companies or foreign affiliates that conduct trials in China. Prior to beginning a trial, the foreign sponsor and the Chinese clinical trial site are required to obtain approval from the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China (HGRAC), which is an agency under the MOST, to collect any biological samples that contain the genetic material of Chinese human subjects, and to transfer cross-border the samples or associated data. Furthermore, one of the key matters that is subject to the HGRAC review and approval process is the IP sharing arrangement between Chinese and foreign parties. The parties are required to share patent rights to inventions arising from the analysis of the samples. Conducting a clinical trial in China without obtaining the relevant HGRAC preapproval will subject the sponsor and trial site to administrative liability, including confiscation of HGRAC samples and associated data, and administrative fines. 
In July 2015, the MOST issued the Service Guide for Administrative Licensing Items concerning Examination and Approval of Sampling, Collecting, Trading, Exporting Human Genetic Resources, or Taking Such Resources out of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which provides that foreign-invested sponsors that sample, collect, or research human genetic resources in clinical trials shall be required to apply for approval of the China Human Genetic Resources Management Office through its online system. In October 2017, the MOST issued the Circular on Optimizing the Administrative Examination and Approval of Human Genetic Resources, which simplified the approval for sampling and collecting human genetic resources for the purpose of commercializing a drug in the PRC. In May 2019, the State Council of PRC issued the Human Genetic Resources Regulation (HGR Regulation), which became effective in July 2019. The HGR Regulation regulates the collection, preservation, usage and provision abroad of China’s human genetic resources. According to this regulation, “human genetic resource” includes human genetic resource materials (such as organs, tissues, cells and other genetic materials containing human genome, genes and other genetic materials) and information (including data generated from human genetic resources materials). The MOST is responsible for the management of human genetic resources at the national level, and the administrative departments of science and technology under the provincial governments are responsible for the management of human genetic resources at local level. Foreign entities, individuals and such entities established or actually controlled by foreign entities are not allowed to collect or preserve China’s human genetic resources or provide human genetic resources abroad. If foreign entities and individuals and foreign-established or foreign-de facto controlled entities intend to use China’s human genetic resources for conducting scientific research, they must comply with the applicable Chinese laws, regulations and rules (including any approval requirements) and carry out such research through collaboration with Chinese research institutions, universities, medical institutions or enterprises. The HGR Regulation formalized the approval requirements pertinent to research collaborations between Chinese and foreign-owned entities. Pursuant to the new rule, a new notification system (as opposed to the advance approval approach originally in place) is put in place for clinical trials using China’s human genetic resources at clinical institutions without involving the export of human genetic resources outside of China. 
In October 2020, the SCNPC promulgated the Biosecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China (the Biosecurity Law), which became effective in April 2021. The Biosecurity Law reaffirms the regulatory requirements stipulated by the HGR Regulation while potentially increasing the administrative fines significantly in cases in which foreign entities are alleged to have collected, preserved or exported Chinese human genetic resources. The Biosecurity Law, which takes the form of national law, gives the MOST more power and discretion to regulate human genetic resource, and further demonstrates the commitments of protecting human genetic resources and safeguarding state biosecurity by the government. 
In December 2020, the SCNPC adopted amendments to the Criminal Code of the People’s Republic of China, effective as of March 2021, which criminalize the illegal collection of China human genetic resources, the illegal transfer of China human genetic resources materials outside of China, and the transfer of China human genetic resources data to foreign parties or entities established or actually controlled by them without going through security review and assessment. An individual who is convicted of any of these violations may be subject to public surveillance, criminal detention, a fixed-term imprisonment of up to seven years, and/or a criminal fine. 




In March 2022, the MOST released the Draft Implementing Rules of the Regulation on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources (Draft for Comment) (the Draft Implementing Rules), which provide operational details for the HGR Regulation. The Draft Implementing Rules clarify that foreign de facto controlled entities includes: (a) overseas organizations or individuals directly or indirectly hold more than 50% of the shares, equity, voting rights, property shares or other similar rights and interests of the institution; (b) although the shares, equities, voting rights, property shares or other similar rights and interests of institutions directly or indirectly held by overseas organizations and individuals lower than 50%, the voting rights or other rights and interests of decision-making bodies they enjoy have the sufficient influence on the decision-making and internal management of the institution; (c) the agreement or other arrangement of the overseas organization or individual is sufficient to exert a significant influence on the decision-making, operation and management of the institution and other major matters; and (d) other circumstances identified by the MOST. The Draft Implementing Rules also provide that administrative approvals are applicable to the collection of human genetic resources within the territory of the PRC, such as, important genetic family, human genetic resources in specific regions, the collection activities for large-scale population studies with more than 3,000 cases. Lastly, the Draft Implementing Rules provide that the parties in a Chinese-foreign cooperative research may mutually agree on attribution of intellectual property derived from such cooperative research utilizing China-Sourced human genetic resources; if no agreement is reached or such agreement is not clear, the intellectual property shall be shared according to the contribution of the parties. As the Draft Implementing Rules were released only for public comment, the final version and the effective date thereof may be subject to change with substantial uncertainty. 
Rest of the world regulation
For other countries outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, privacy, information security, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Manufacturing
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and currently do not have any plans to do so in the future. As such, we are developing robust and replicable manufacturing processes and analytical methods in concert with world-class, global CMOs. Additionally, we plan to maintain efficient use of inventory, leveraging advanced supply chain planning capabilities and storing inventory at the most strategic points of the value chain to ensure reliability of supply for EQRx and our combination partners, as appropriate.
For clinical supply, we use CMOs that act in accordance with the FDA’s cGMP for the manufacture of drug substance and product. Today, we rely on third parties for the production of all of our clinical supply drug substance and drug product and we expect to continue to do so in the future. We use additional CMOs to fill, label, package, store and distribute investigational drug products. It is our intent to identify and qualify additional CMOs to provide drug substance and drug product services (including packaging and distribution) as products move into the regulatory approval stage for any product candidates that complete clinical development. In parallel, we are designing our supply chains for late-stage clinical programs with dual sourcing of both drug substance manufacturing and drug product formulation.
All of our CMOs have Quality Management Systems in line with U.S., EU and UK regulatory expectations and our internal quality function has full oversight responsibility, including on-site pre and post approval inspections, for those suppliers. The quality oversight is ensured through the supply and quality agreements agreed with all of our suppliers.
We will continue to evaluate whether there is strategic benefit to internalizing certain technologies or processes. This assessment will be based on our priorities of quality, reliability, and value, as well as risk management factors, including supply constraints and geopolitical concerns.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 362 full-time employees, of whom 74 have M.D. and/or Ph.D. degrees. At such date, we also had one part-time employee, and approximately 59 consultants/contractors. Within our workforce, 190 employees of those were engaged in research and development and 173 were engaged in business development, commercial, finance, legal, and general management and administration as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong, as evidenced by our receipt of more than 50 awards for company culture and leadership, including 20 awards in 2022.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
In February 2023, we announced a reduction in force as part of our continued drive to further increase operational efficiency and streamline expenses.
