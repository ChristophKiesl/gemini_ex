Item 1.  Business.
 
The Company is an Iowa limited liability company located in Council Bluffs, Iowa, formed in March 2005. The Company is permitted to produce 147 million gallons of ethanol.  We began producing ethanol in February 2009 and sell our ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil in the United States, Mexico and the Pacific Rim.  
 
Our production facility (the “Facility”) is located in Pottawattamie County in southwestern Iowa, south of Council Bluffs. It is near two major interstate highways, I-29 and I-80, within a mile of the Missouri River and has access to five major rail carriers. This location is in close proximity to a significant amount of corn and has convenient product market access. The Facility receives corn and chemical deliveries primarily by truck and is able to utilize rail delivery if necessary.  Finished products are shipped by rail and truck.  The site has access to water from ground wells and from the Missouri River.  Additionally, in close proximity to the Facility are providers of our primary energy sources (natural gas and electricity), with two natural gas providers available, both with infrastructure immediately accessible to the Facility, and one electrical provider. 
 
Financial Information
 
Please refer to “Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities, as they relate to our overall financial condition, results of operations, and material cash requirements, as well as “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for our financial statements and supplementary data.
 
Operations
 
During the first part of 2021, the Company, and the ethanol industry as a whole, experienced significant adverse conditions as a result of industry-wide record low ethanol prices due to reduced demand and high industry inventory levels, primarily attributable to the decrease in travel brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, ("Fiscal 2022"), the ethanol industry experienced a significant increase in ethanol prices due to increased demand as the population of the United States began to go back to work after the pandemic, but supply remained low due to many ethanol companies reducing production or going completely idle. Ethanol prices remained at higher levels throughout Fiscal 2022, however the price of corn also increased during that time period, reducing the record margins we experienced during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.   
Paycheck Protection Program Loan
 
On April 14, 2020, the Company received $1.1 million under the new Paycheck Protection Program legislation passed in response to the economic downturn triggered by COVID-19, and on January 28, 2021, the Company received an additional $1.1 million under Phase II of the PPP legislation (collectively the PPP Loans"). Our PPP Loan may be forgiven based upon various factors, including, without limitation, our payroll cost over an eight-to-twenty-four week period starting upon our receipt of the funds. Expenses for approved payroll costs, lease payments on agreements before February 15, 2020, and utility payments under agreements before February 1, 2020 and certain other specified costs can be paid with these funds and eligible for payment forgiveness by the federal government. At least 60% of the proceeds must be used for approved payroll costs, and no more than 40% on non-payroll expenses. PPP loan proceeds used by a borrower for the approved expense categories have generally been fully forgiven by the lender if the borrower satisfies certain employee headcount and compensation requirements. The Company applied for forgiveness on its PPP Loans from the Small Business Administration ("SBA") and was notified on December 24, 2021 that the PPP Loans had been forgiven in full. The gain on the debt extinguishment was recorded in other income.   
Rail Access
 
We own a six-mile loop railroad track for rail service to our Facility, which accommodates several unit trains.  We are party to an Industrial Track Agreement with CBEC Railway, Inc. (the “Track Agreement “), which governs our use of the loop railroad and requires, among other things, that we maintain the loop track.
 
On March 24, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Amended and Restated Railcar Lease Agreement (“Railcar Agreement”) with Bunge North America, Inc. (“Bunge”), for the lease of 323 ethanol cars and 111 hopper cars which are used for the delivery and marketing of our ethanol and distillers grains.
 
The Railcar Agreement was amended to 110 hopper cars effective November 2019 and effective July 17, 2020, Bunge sold their tankers to Trinity Leasing. Trinity Leasing entered into a lease agreement with the Company which incorporates the terms of the original Bunge Railcar Agreement but reduced the ethanol car level to 320 ethanol cars. Under the Railcar Agreement, the original DOT111 tank cars are leased over a four-year term from March 24, 2019 to April 30, 2023, with the ability to start returning cars after January 1, 2023 to conform to the requirement for DOT117 tank cars with enhanced safety specifications which is scheduled to be effective in May 2023. The 110 hopper cars are leased over a three-year term running from March 24, 2019 to March 31, 2022 which term continued on a month-to-month basis thereafter. We were notified during Fiscal 2022 that Bunge required us to return the 110 hoppers by November 1, 2022. As of November 7, 2022 all hoppers have been returned to Bunge. As of September 30, 2022, we had secured 35 hoppers in leases that began September 1, 2022 and run through August of 2027.  In February 2019, we entered into a second 36-month lease for an additional 30 tank cars from Trinity Leasing, which lease ran through January 2022 and is month-to-month thereafter, and in June 2021 we leased an additional 70 tank cars from Trinity Leasing, which lease runs through April 2023.

Employees
 
Our employees are the cornerstone of the Company's operations. We had 68 full time employees, as of September 30, 2022.  We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we have not experienced any work stoppages.  Our management considers our employee relationships to be favorable. We employ individuals in the local region around our one facility, though we have attracted talent from across the country as needed to fill our roles which require technical or professional backgrounds. We compete for employees with competitive wages and benefits. Employee safety remains our top priority and the Company develops and administers company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each team member and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.  This includes routine safety training, and assessments as well as annual safety audits. 
Principal Products
 
The principal products we produce are ethanol, distillers grains, distillers corn oil, and carbon dioxide ("CO2").
 
Ethanol
 
Our primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn and various other grains, which can be used as: (i) an octane enhancer in fuels; (ii) an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; and (iii) a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute.  More than 99% of all ethanol produced in the United States is used in its primary form for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products.  The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally wholesale gasoline marketers or blenders.  Ethanol is shipped by truck in the local markets, and by rail in the regional, national and international markets.
 

We produced 121.9 million and 129.8 million gallons of ethanol for Fiscal 2022 and the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2021 (“Fiscal 2021”), respectively, and approximately 75% of our revenue was derived from the sale of ethanol in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021. The decrease in gallons produced, during Fiscal 2022, resulted from additional maintenance time that was needed to repair various items within the plant. 
 
Distillers Grain
 
The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein, high-energy animal feed marketed primarily to the beef and dairy industries.  Distillers grains contain by-pass protein that is superior to other protein supplements such as cottonseed meal and soybean meal.  We produce two forms of distillers grains: wet distillers grains with solubles (“WDGS”) and dried distillers grains with solubles (“DDGS”).  WDGS are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% to 65% moisture.  WDGS have a shelf life of approximately seven days and are sold to local markets.  DDGS are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% to 12% moisture.  It has a longer shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market.
 
In Fiscal 2022, we sold 2% less tons of distillers grains compared to Fiscal 2021. Approximately 16.3% and 18.3% of our revenue was derived from the sale of distillers grains in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively. The decrease in distillers grains produced and sold during Fiscal 2022 resulted principally from the plant operating fewer hours in Fiscal 2022 than Fiscal 2021 due to the increased plant maintenance time during Fiscal 2022. 
 
Corn Oil
 
Our system separates corn oil from the post-fermentation syrup stream as it leaves the evaporators of the ethanol plant. The corn oil is then routed to storage tanks, and the remaining concentrated syrup is routed to the plant’s syrup tank. Corn oil can be marketed as either a feed additive or a biodiesel feedstock.  We sold 10.7% greater tons of corn oil in Fiscal 2022 than in Fiscal 2021, with approximately 8% and 6.3% of our revenue generated from corn oil sales, respectively.
 
    3 

  

Carbon Dioxide
 
In April 2013, we entered into a Carbon Dioxide Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “CO2 Agreement”) with Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., formerly known as EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. ("Air Products") under which we agreed to supply, and Air Products agreed to purchase, a portion of raw CO2 gas produced by our facility. In addition, we entered into a Non-Exclusive CO2 Facility Site Lease Agreement under which we granted Air Products a non-exclusive right of entry and license to construct, maintain and operate a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant (the “CO2 Plant”) on a site near our facility. The term of the CO2 Agreement runs for ten (10) years from the startup of the CO2 Plant (the “Initial Term”) and then renews automatically for two (2) additional five (5) year periods thereafter, unless written notice of termination is submitted within six (6) months prior to the end of the then-current term.
 
Air Products pays us a base price per ton, which acts as a floor price, Air Products will pay us an additional amount based on Air Products profits above a minimum targeted margin. The CO2 Agreement also contains a take or pay obligation pursuant to which Air Products agrees to pay us for a minimum number of tons each year. CO2 was 0.2% of our revenue for Fiscal 2022 and 0.3% in Fiscal 2021.
 
Principal Product Markets
 
As described below in “Distribution Methods,” we market and distribute all of our denatured ethanol through Bunge pursuant to the terms of an Ethanol Agreement effective January 1, 2020, and we market and distribute all of our distiller grains and corn oil ourselves. 
 
Our ethanol, distillers grains and distillers corn oil are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as markets allow, our products can be, and have been, sold in the export markets. We explore all markets for our distillers grains and corn oil products, and we expect Bunge to explore all markets for our ethanol, including export markets. We believe that there is some potential for increased international sales of our products; however, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our products to continue to be marketed and sold domestically.
 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the "EIA"), in the first eight months of 2022, ethanol exports increased 27% as compared to the first eight months of 2021, and 15% as compared to the first eight months of 2020. This puts exports at their highest level for this period since 2018.Canada remains the country importing  the largest percentage of ethanol produced in the United States. South Korea has become the second largest export market for ethanol produced in the United States, while India remains close behind as the third largest destination of U.S. ethanol exports. Exports of the U.S. ethanol to these three countries constitute roughly 52% of all U.S. ethanol exports. The Netherlands and Brazil represent the remaining countries in the top 5 for destinations for U.S. ethanol exports in the first eight months of 2022.
 
Ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand, and tends to fluctuate over time as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. For instance, a strong U.S. Dollar is an example of a force that may negatively impact ethanol exports from the United States. In addition, the Chinese and Brazil tariffs have had, and likely will continue to have, a negative impact on the export market demand and prices for ethanol produced in the United States. There is also potential for the imposition of tariffs by other countries in addition to Brazil and China due to trade disputes with the United States which could reduce the overall export demand and therefore could have a negative impact on ethanol prices.
 
Distillers grains have become more accepted as animal feed throughout the world and therefore, distillers grains exports have increased and may continue to increase as worldwide acceptance grows. According to the Renewable Fuels Association (the "RFA"), U.S. distillers grains annual exports through September 30, 2022 were approximately 1% higher than distillers grains exports for the same nine month period last year. Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam are now the top destinations for U.S. distillers grains.
 
We market and distribute all of the corn oil we produce directly to end users or middlemen within the domestic market. Corn oil can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses.

Distribution Methods
 
The Company is a party to an Amended and Restated Ethanol Purchase Agreement effective January 1, 2020 with Bunge (the “Ethanol Agreement”). Under the Ethanol Agreement, the Company sells Bunge denatured ethanol produced by the Company, and Bunge purchases the same.  The Company pays Bunge a flat monthly marketing fee for its services under the Ethanol Agreement. The term of the Ethanol Agreement expires on December 31, 2026.
 
Rail lease charges are the monthly lease payment for rail cars along with all administrative and tax filing fees for such leased rail cars.
 
Raw Materials
 
Corn Requirements
 
The principal raw material necessary to produce ethanol, distillers grain and corn oil is corn. We are significantly dependent on the availability and price of corn which are affected by supply and demand factors such as crop production, carryout, exports, government policies and programs, risk management and weather.  With the volatility of the weather and commodity markets, we cannot predict the future price of corn. Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to corn prices, we, like most ethanol producers, are not able to compensate for increases in the cost of corn through adjustments in our prices for our ethanol although we do see increases in the prices of our distillers grain during times of higher corn prices. However, given that ethanol sales comprise a majority of our revenues, our inability to adjust our ethanol prices can result in a negative impact on our profitability during periods of high corn prices.
 
High corn prices have a negative effect on our operating margins unless the price of ethanol and distillers grains out paces rising corn prices. During Fiscal 2022, corn prices were higher compared to Fiscal 2021. Overall corn acres planted in 2022 were down 3.3% over 2021 and the nationwide yield was 2.4% lower than in 2021 as well. Drought conditions varied widely across Iowa and Nebraska which has resulted in lower bushels received during the 2022 harvest compared to the 2021 harvest.
 
Our management expects that corn prices will remain steady or move slightly higher through the first two quarters of our fiscal year ending September 30, 2023 ("Fiscal 2023") due to the expected yield reductions that are forecasted by the United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA"). If corn prices continue to be at the higher price levels seen in 2021 and 2022, it would have an adverse impact on our operating margins unless the prices we receive for our ethanol and distillers grains are able to outpace the higher corn prices. Management continually monitors corn prices and the availability of corn near the Facility and also continually attempts to minimize the effects of the volatility of corn costs on profitability through its risk management strategies, including hedging positions taken in the corn market.
 
Our Facility would need approximately 48.3 million bushels of corn annually, to produce 140 million gallons of ethanol, or approximately 132,300 bushels per day.  During Fiscal 2022 we purchased 8.5% less corn compared to Fiscal 2021, which was obtained entirely from local markets. The Company is responsible for procuring the corn necessary for the operation of the Facility.

Energy Requirements
 
The production of ethanol is an energy intensive process which uses significant amounts of electricity and steam or natural gas as a heat source.  Presently, 21,000 to 22,000 MMBTUs of energy are required to produce a gallon of ethanol.  It is our goal to operate the plant as safely and profitably as possible, optimizing the amount of energy consumed per gallon of ethanol produced, balanced with the relative values of WDGS as compared to DDGS.  
 
In September 2019, the Company went on line with the Whitefox Integrated Cartridge Efficiency (ICE) system to push towards more efficient operations in our plant. This technology benefits the plant through energy reduction, purity flexibility and debottlenecking of the distillation and dehydration processes. Energy efficiency improved by approximately 1,000 BTU's per gallon of ethanol produced, which results in steam savings and carbon emission reductions In April 2020, the Company implemented Bioleap's Dryer Exhaust Energy Recovers ("DEER"). The DEER system reduces the steam load on the boilers, providing immediate energy savings and freeing up capacity on the current boiler system.
 

Steam
 
We are party to a Steam Service Contract (“Steam Contract”) with MidAmerican Energy Company (“MidAm”), under which MidAm agreed to provide up to 475,000 pounds of steam per hour. The Steam Contract links our net energy rates and charges for steam to certain specified energy indexes, subject to certain minimum and maximum rates. The Steam Contract expires in November 2024. During Fiscal 2022, we did not purchase any steam from MidAm and steam availability from MidAm continues to be volatile as a result of MidAm’s increased utilization of wind energy, rather than coal, since Fiscal 2017.
Natural Gas
 
Natural gas accounted for approximately 67.7% of our energy usage (natural gas and electricity) in Fiscal 2022, compared to 66.3% in Fiscal 2021. The increase in our natural gas usage was due to decreased steam availability and certain minimum payment obligations specified in our contract with MidAm. We have two natural gas boilers for use when our steam service is unavailable. Natural gas is also needed for incidental purposes.  We entered into a natural gas supply agreement with Encore Energy in April of 2012 to fulfill our natural gas needs at the Gas Daily Midpoint pricing.  
Electricity
 
Our Facility requires a large continuous supply of electrical energy.  In Fiscal 2022 we used approximately 1.4% more electricity compared to Fiscal 2021. The slight increase was due to high usage at peak times. The Company continues to explore technology improvements that reduce the amount of electricity we use and automating the timing of turning on equipment that requires large electrical loads.
Water
 
We require a supply of water typical for the industry for our production process.  Our primary water source comes from the underground Missouri River aquifer via our three onsite wells. The majority of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled back into the plant.  All our ground water is treated through our onsite water oxidation system. This filtered water is used throughout our process. We do treat (polish) some of this filtered water for boiler and cooling tower make-up with our Reverse Osmosis (RO) system to minimize any elements that will harm the boiler and steam systems as permitted.  We send some of our non-process contact water back to the Missouri River.  The makeup water requirements for the cooling tower are primarily a result of evaporation and cooling.  We also evaporate much of our water through our dryer system for dried corn distillers grains.  The rest of our process water is recycled back into the plant, which minimizes waste of our water supply.

Other trademarks, service marks and trade names used in this report constitute common law trademarks and/or service marks of the Company. Other parties’ marks referred to in this report are the property of their respective owners. We were granted a perpetual license by ICM, Inc. (“ICM”) to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our Facility.  There is no ongoing fee or definitive calendar term for this license.
 
Seasonality of Sales
 
We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand.
Risk Management and Hedging Transactions
 
The profitability of our operations is highly dependent on the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices.  We use various derivative instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk and to reduce the risk that our ethanol production will become unprofitable when market prices among our principal commodities and products do not correlate.  In order to mitigate our commodity and product price risks, we enter into hedging transactions, including forward corn, ethanol, distillers grain and natural gas contracts, in an attempt to partially offset the effects of price volatility for corn and ethanol.  We also enter into over-the-counter and exchange-traded futures and option contracts for corn, ethanol and distillers grains, designed to limit our exposure to increases in the price of corn and manage ethanol price fluctuations.  Although we believe that our hedging strategies can reduce the risk of price fluctuations, the financial statement impact of these activities depends upon, among other things, the prices involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities involved.  Our hedging activities could cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.  As corn and ethanol prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments.
 

Hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the price of the commodity underlying the hedging agreement and the actual prices paid or received by us for the physical commodity bought or sold.  There are also situations where the hedging transactions themselves may result in losses, as when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol and distillers grains.
 
We continually monitor and manage our commodity risk exposure and our hedging transactions as part of our overall risk management policy.  As a result, we may vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake, and we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions.  Our ability to hedge is always subject to our liquidity and available capital.
 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
As discussed above, we have a marketing agreement with Bunge for the purpose of marketing and distributing our denatured ethanol product.   Currently, we do not have the ability to market our ethanol internally should Bunge be unable or refuse to market our ethanol at acceptable prices. However, we anticipate that we would be able to very quickly secure competitive marketers should we need to replace Bunge for any reason.
 
In Fiscal 2022, Bunge constituted 65.7% of total revenues, compared to almost 74% of revenue in Fiscal 2021.

Competition 
 
Domestic Ethanol Competitors
 
The ethanol we produce is similar to ethanol produced by other domestic plants.  At the end of 2021, the Renewable Fuels Association ("RFA") estimated that there were 208 installed ethanol production facilities in the United States with a total capacity of 17.7 billion gallons based on nameplate capacity and 5 additional plants under expansion or construction. In Fiscal 2022 we have seen a rebound in the ethanol margin environment that shows a substantial improvement from the decade lows experienced in 2020. As a result, competing plants have come back on line or otherwise resumed operations and expansion has resumed within the industry, primarily in North Dakota. While it is important to note that 2020 was an atypical year as transportation fuel demand was severely reduced because of COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns, there is renewed optimism in the market as ethanol commodity prices have pushed through the $2.00/ gallon mark, a feat last accomplished in 2014.

Since ethanol is a commodity product, competition in the industry is predominately based on price. The top five producers account for almost half of domestic production. We are in direct competition with many of these top five producers as well as other national producers, many of whom have greater resources and experience than we have and each of which is producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. In addition, we believe that the ethanol industry will continue to consolidate leading to a market where a small number of large ethanol producers with substantial production capacities will control an even larger portion of the U.S. ethanol production. In recent years, the ethanol industry has also seen increased competition from oil companies that have purchased ethanol production facilities. These oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year.
 
We may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our larger competitors and the oil companies who are capable of producing a significantly greater amount of ethanol, have multiple ethanol plants that may help them achieve certain efficiencies and other benefits that we cannot achieve with one ethanol plant or are able to operate at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate. For instance, ethanol producers that own multiple plants may be able to compete in the marketplace more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable, because they have the flexibility to run certain production facilities while reducing production or shutting down production at other facilities. These large producers may also be able to realize economies of scale which we are unable to realize or they may have better negotiating positions with purchasers.  Further, new products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could create competitive advantages over us.
 
Foreign Ethanol Competitors
 
In recent years, the ethanol industry has experienced increased competition from international suppliers of ethanol and although ethanol imports have decreased during the past few years, if competition from ethanol imports were to increase again, such increased imports could negatively impact demand for domestic ethanol which could adversely impact our financial results. Large international companies with much greater resources than ours have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities.
 
Many international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from inputs other than corn, such as sugarcane, and have cost structures that may be substantially lower than U.S. based ethanol producers including us. Many of these international suppliers are companies with much greater resources than us with greater production capacities.

Brazil is the world’s second largest ethanol producer. Brazil makes ethanol primarily from sugarcane as opposed to corn, and depending on feedstock prices, may be less expensive to produce. Brazilian imports account for less than 1% of U.S. ethanol consumed. Many in the ethanol industry are concerned that certain provisions of the Renewable Fuel Standard (the "RFS") as adopted may disproportionately benefit ethanol produced from sugarcane. This could make sugarcane based ethanol, which is primarily produced in Brazil, more competitive in the United States ethanol market. If this were to occur, it could reduce demand for the ethanol that we produce. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for certain obligated parties to comply with the RFS requirement to blend 5 billion gallons of advanced biofuels. U.S. imports of ethanol produced in Brazil are flat through the first eight months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. During 2021, U.S. ethanol imports declined due to lower production and higher prices of Brazilian ethanol, declining prices of California Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits, and volatile RFS credit price dynamics. Per the RFA, virtually all imports of fuel ethanol in 2021 entered the United States in California, where they can take advantage of the state's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and get premium values for "advanced biofuel" RFS credits.  
 
Depending on feedstock prices, ethanol imported from foreign countries, including Brazil, may be less expensive than domestically-produced ethanol.  However, foreign demand, transportation costs and infrastructure constraints may temper the market impact on the United States.
 
Local Ethanol Production
 
Because we are located on the border of Iowa and Nebraska, and because ethanol producers generally compete primarily with local and regional producers, the ethanol producers located in Iowa and Nebraska presently constitute our primary competition.  According to the RFA, Iowa had 43 operating ethanol refineries in production, with a combined nameplate capacity to produce 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol.  For Nebraska, the RFA reports there are currently 26 existing ethanol plants in production in Nebraska, with a combined ethanol nameplate production capacity of approximately 2.4 billion gallons. Given the recent highs in ethanol margins, local competition continues to strengthen following the downturn in 2020 caused primarily by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Competition from Alternative Renewable Fuels
 
Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn, including cellulose. Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls and is the most common organic compound on earth. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks, rice straw, amongst other common plants. Cellulosic ethanol is ethanol produced from cellulose. Research continues regarding cellulosic ethanol, and various companies are in various stages of developing and constructing some of the first generation cellulosic plants. Several companies have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and are producing cellulosic ethanol on a small scale and, at a few companies in the United States have begun producing on a commercial scale. Additional commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants could be completed in the near future, although these cellulosic ethanol plants have continued to face financial and technological issues. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.
 
 Because our Facility is designed as a single-feedstock facility, we have limited ability to adapt the plant to a different feedstock or process system without additional capital investment and retooling.
 
A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Like ethanol, the emerging fuel cell and electric-powered vehicle industries offer technological options to address worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves and environmental concerns. Fuel cells have emerged as a potential alternative to certain existing power sources because of their higher efficiency, reduced noise and lower emissions. Fuel cell industry participants are currently targeting the transportation, stationary power and portable power markets in order to decrease fuel costs, lessen dependence on crude oil and reduce harmful emissions. The same can be said of electric-powered vehicles. If the fuel cell industry continues to expand and gain broad acceptance and becomes readily available to consumers for motor vehicle use, we may not be able to compete effectively. Likewise, participants in the emerging electric-powered vehicle industry are currently targeting the transportation market to decrease dependence on crude oil and reduce harmful emissions. If the electric-powered vehicle industry continues to expand and gain broad acceptance, the ethanol and larger gasoline industry may not be able to compete effectively. This additional competition could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.

Distillers Grain Competition
 
Ethanol plants in the Midwest produce the majority of distillers grains and primarily compete with other ethanol producers in the production and sales of distillers grains. According to the RFA 2022 Ethanol Outlook (the "RFA 2022 Outlook"), ethanol plants produced almost 35.4 million metric tons of distillers grains and other animal feed in 2021 and 3.8 billion pounds of distillers corn oil.  We compete with other producers of distillers grains products both locally and nationally.
 
The primary customers of distillers grains are dairy and beef cattle, according to the RFA 2022 Outlook, which comprises 74% of distiller grains consumption. In recent years, an increasing amount of distillers grains have been used in the swine, poultry and fish markets. Numerous feeding trials show advantages in milk production, growth, rumen health, and palatability over other dairy cattle feeds. With the advancement of research into the feeding rations of poultry and swine, we expect these markets to expand and create additional demand for distillers grains; however, no assurance can be given that these markets will in fact expand, or if they do, that we will benefit from such expansion.
 
The market for distillers grains is generally confined to locations where freight costs allow it to be competitively priced against other feed ingredients. Distillers grains compete with three other feed formulations: corn gluten feed, dry brewers grain and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Dry brewers grain and distillers grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. Distillers grains contain nutrients, fat content, and fiber that we believe will differentiate our distillers grains products from other feed formulations. However, producers of other forms of animal feed may also have greater experience and resources than we do and their products may have greater acceptance among producers of beef and dairy cattle, poultry and hogs.
 
Principal Supply & Demand Factors
 
Ethanol
 
Ethanol prices increased dramatically during Fiscal 2022 , reaching heights not seen since 2014 as the rebounding demand for blended gasoline and decreased supply following slow-downs in production during Fiscal 2020 caused prices to rise. The average price received for a gallon of ethanol averaged $2.41 in Fiscal 2022 compared to $1.76 in Fiscal 2021. The same price increases were also experienced with the inputs where the price of corn increased from an average of $5.47 a bushel in Fiscal 2021 to an average of $6.43 a bushel in Fiscal 2022. 
 
Management currently expects ethanol prices will continue to adjust to the supply and demand factors of ethanol and oil and will generally fluctuate with, but not be directly correlated to, the price of corn.  
 
Management believes the industry will need to align the retail product delivery infrastructure and demand for ethanol in order to increase production margins in the near and long term. The supply and demand in the industry remain in relative balance at current production values.
 
Management also believes it is important that ethanol blending capabilities of the gasoline market be expanded to increase demand for ethanol.  Recently, there has been increased awareness of the need to expand retail ethanol distribution and blending infrastructure, which would allow the ethanol industry to supply ethanol to markets in the United States that are not currently selling significant amounts of ethanol. On April 29, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, (the "EPA"), issued an emergency waiver, allowing E15 (gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol) to be sold during the summer driving season. As of this filing, according to Prime the Pump, E15 is sold year-round at approximately 2,743 stations in 31 states.  The EPA has stated that it will continue to monitor the supply with industry and federal partners, and the EPA expects to issue new waivers effectively extending the emergency fuel waiver until such time as the extreme and unusual fuel supply circumstances due to the war in Ukraine are no longer present.

Distillers Grains
 
Distillers grains compete with other protein-based animal feed products. Every bushel of corn used in the dry grind ethanol process yields approximately 17 pounds of dry distillers grains, which is an excellent source of energy and protein for livestock and poultry.  The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are derived. Downward pressure on commodity prices, such as soybeans and corn, will generally cause the price of competing animal feed products to decline, resulting in downward pressure on the price of distillers grains.
 
Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have correlated with prices of corn. However, there have been occasions when the price increase for this co-product has not been directly correlated to changes in corn prices. In addition, our distillers grains compete with products made from other feedstocks, the cost of which may not rise when corn prices rise. Consequently, the price we may receive for distillers grains may not rise as corn prices rise, thereby lowering our cost recovery percentage relative to corn.
 
Management expects that distillers grain prices will continue to generally follow the price of corn during Fiscal 2023.
 
Competition for Supply of Corn
 
During crop year 2022/23, according to the USDA October 2022 report, 80.8 million acres of corn were harvested, which is down 5.3% from 2021/22. The expected yield is 172.5 bushels per acre, which is down 2.4% compared to 2021's results. The higher prices for corn experienced in Fiscal 2022 are expected to continue due to drought conditions and supply constraints.
 
Competition for corn supply from other ethanol plants and other corn customers exists around our Facility.  According to the RFA 2022 Outlook, there were 43 operational ethanol plants in Iowa. The plants are concentrated, for the most part, in the northern and central regions of the state where a majority of the corn is produced.

We compete with other users of corn, including ethanol producers regionally and nationally, producers of food and food ingredients for human consumption (such as high fructose corn syrup, starches, and sweeteners), producers of animal feed and industrial users. According to the USDA, for 2022/2023, 5.3 billion bushels of U.S. corn are expected to be used in ethanol production, with 6.8 billion bushels being used in food and other industrial uses, and 2.3 billion bushels used for export. In 2021/2022, 5.3 billion bushel were used in ethanol production, with 6.8 billion used in food and other industrial uses and 2.5 billion used for export.

Federal Ethanol Support and Governmental Regulations
 
Renewable Fuel Standard
 
The ethanol industry receives support through the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the "RFS") which has been, and continues to be, a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage. The RFS requires that each year a certain amount of renewable fuels must be used in the United States. The RFS is a national program that allows refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas of the country where it is most cost-effective. The EPA is responsible for revising and implementing regulations to ensure that transportation fuel sold in the United States contains a minimum volume of renewable fuel. The RFS statutory volume requirement increases incrementally each year until the United States is statutorily required to use 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by calendar year 2022. The EPA has the authority, however, to waive the RFS statutory volume requirements, in whole or in part, provided that there is either inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States.
 
Annually, the EPA is required by statute to pass a rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligation. For 2020, 2021, and 2022 the statutory volume requirements for renewable fuels were 30 billion gallons, 33 billion gallons, and 36 billion gallons, respectively. On June 3, 2022, the EPA released the final rules for the renewable volume obligations ("RVOs") for 2020, 2021 and 2022, and set the RVOs at 17.13 billion gallons for 2020, 18.84 billion gallons for 2021 and 20.63 billion gallons for 2022. An additional 250 million supplemental gallons were added to the RVOs for 2022 in order to address the court-ordered remand of previously lowered RVOs for 2014-2016.
 
On December 1, 2022, the EPA released a proposed rule to set the RVOs for 2023, 2024 and 2025 which set the annual volume requirement for renewable fuel at 20.82 billion gallons for 2023, 21.87 billion gallons for 2024 and 22.68 billion gallons for 2025 (the “Proposed Rule”). This is the first time that the EPA has set RVOs without using the volume requirements set out in the Energy Independent and Security Act of 2002 (the “EISA”) which provided statutory volume requirements through 2022. When setting the volume requirements beyond the statutory mandates within the EISA, the EPA has more discretion and takes into consideration various factors including, without limitation, costs, air quality, climate change, energy security and infrastructure issues. Under the Proposed Rule, the number of gallons which may be met by conventional renewable fuels such as corn-based ethanol is set at 15.0 billion gallons for 2023 and increases to 15.25 billion gallons in 2024 and 2025. The Proposed Rule also provides for an additional 250 million gallon supplemental volume requirement in 2023 to continue to address the court-ordered remand of previously lowered RVOs as a result of denied small refinery waivers. The EPA is currently soliciting comments on the Proposed Rule and a public hearing on the Proposed Rule will be held in January 10, 2023. 
 
Federal regulations supporting the use of renewable fuels like the RFS are a significant driver of ethanol demand in the U.S. Under the RFS, the EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders, and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total domestic transportation fuel sales. The mechanism that provides accountability in RFS compliance is the Renewable Identification Number ("RIN"). RINs are a tradeable commodity given that if refiners (obligated parties) need additional RINs to be compliant, they have to purchase them from those that have excess. Thus, there is an economic incentive to use renewable fuels like ethanol, or in the alternative, buy RINs. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-regulated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by ethanol producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties.
 
The Proposed Rule also sets out proposed regulations relating to the generation of RINS for renewable electricity used to fuel vehicles (“eRINS”). Under the Proposed Rule, car manufacturers would be able to register with the EPA and generate eRINs for power produced from qualifying renewable biomass, including biogas from methane digesters and anaerobic digestion facilities. The Proposed Rule specifies that qualifying renewable electricity must be generated from a feedstock that qualifies as renewable biomass under Section 211(o)(1)(I) of the Clean Air Act and that other forms of renewable electricity, such as solar, wind and hydropower, will not qualify for eRINs. Manufacturers could start earning eRINs in 2024. As noted above, the Proposed Rule is currently open for public comment and in the Proposed Rule, the EPA notes that it is open to comments on alternative approaches to eRINs, including allowing renewable electricity producers, public access charging stations, independent third parties, or a combination of entities to generate credits. We cannot predict at this time the impact, if any, that the generation of eRINs will have on the traditional RIN market.
 
Although renewable volume obligations establish the number of gallons of renewable fuel that must be blended into the nation’s fuel supply, these obligations do not take into account waivers granted by the EPA to small refiners for "hardship." The EPA can, in consultation with the Department of Energy, waive the obligation for individual smaller refineries that are suffering“ disproportionate economic hardship” due to compliance with the RFS. To qualify for this “small refinery waiver,” the refineries must be under total throughput of 75,000 barrels per day and state their case for an exemption in an application to the EPA each year. On June 3, 2022, the EPA announced the denial of 69 petitions from small refineries seeking small refinery exemptions(SREs) from the RFS program for one or more of the compliance years between 2016 and 2021. Having a final conclusion to this issue that has been ongoing for many years will help provide more stability within the RIN's market; however, there are multiple legal challenges to how the EPA has handled SREs and RFS rulemakings.

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
 
Among its other provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, significantly expands clean energy incentives by providing an estimated $370 billion of new energy related tax credits over the next ten years. It also permits more flexibility for taxpayers to use the credits with direct-pay and transferable credit options.
 
More specifically, the IRA legislation (a) created a new Clean Fuel Production Credit, section 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code, which runs from 2025 to 2027 of up to $1.00 per gallon, which could apply to our fuel ethanol, depending on the level of GHG reduction for each gallon; (b) created a new tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel of $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon, depending on the GHG reduction for each gallon, that could possibly involve some of our low carbon ethanol through an alcohol to jet pathway, depending on the life cycle analysis model being used (this credit expires after 2024 and shifts to the Clean Fuel Production Credit, where it qualifies for up to $1.75 per gallon); (c) expanded the carbon capture and sequestration credit, section 45Q, to $85 for each metric ton of carbon sequestered, which could impact potential carbon capture investments; (d) extended the biodiesel tax credit which could impact our distillers corn oil values, as this co-product serves as a low-carbon feedstock for renewable diesel and biomass based diesel production; (e) funded biofuel refueling infrastructure, which could impact the availability of higher level ethanol blended fuel; (f) increased funding for working lands conservation programs for farmers by $20 billion; and (g) provided credits for the production and purchase of electric vehicles, which could impact the amount of internal combustion engines built and sold longer term, and by extension impact the demand for liquid fuels including ethanol.
 
The IRA is a sweeping policy that could have many potential impacts on our business and the Company continues to evaluate the provisions of the IRA and its potential benefits.
 
State Initiatives and Mandates
 
In 2006, Iowa passed legislation promoting the use of renewable fuels in Iowa. One of the most significant provisions of the Iowa renewable fuels legislation was a renewable fuels targeted set of tax credits encouraging an escalating percentage of the gasoline sold in Iowa to consist of, be blended with, or be replaced by, renewable fuels. To receive the tax credit, retailers of gasoline are required to reach escalating annual targets of the percentage of their gasoline sales that consist of, are blended with, or are replaced by, renewable fuels. This renewable fuel tax credit originally required 10% of the gasoline that retailers sold to fall within the renewable fuels definitions to receive the credit and has increased incrementally to 25% as of January 1, 2020. This tax credit automatically repealed itself on January 1, 2021 for tax years beginning on or after that date.
Environmental and Other Regulations and Permits
 
Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate matters, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and sulfur dioxide.  Ethanol production also requires the use of significant volumes of water, a portion of which is treated and discharged into the environment.  We are required to maintain various environmental and operating permits.  Even though we have successfully acquired the permits necessary for our operations, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources on complying with such regulations.  In addition, if we sought to expand the Facility’s capacity in the future, above our current 140 million gallons, we would likely be required to acquire additional regulatory permits and could also be required to install additional pollution control equipment.   Our failure to obtain and maintain any environmental and/or operating permits currently required or which may be required in the future could force us to make material changes to our Facility or to shut down altogether.

The U.S. Supreme Court has classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. As stated above, we believe the final RFS2 regulations grandfather our plant at its current operating capacity, though expansion of our plant will need to meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from a baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. In order to expand capacity at our plant above our current permitted 147 million gallons, we will be required to obtain additional permits and install improved technology.
 
Part of our business is regulated by environmental laws and regulations governing the labeling, use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials. Other examples of government policies that can have an impact on our business include tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions and outright embargos.
 
We also employ maintenance and operations personnel at our Facility. In addition to the attention that we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations at our Facility are governed by the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA.
 
We have obtained all of the necessary permits to operate the plant. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations.
