ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Located in Grass Valley, CA, BrewBilt is one of the only California companies that custom designs, hand crafts, and integrates processing, fermentation and distillation processing systems for the craft beer, cannabis and hemp industries using Best in Class American made components integrated with stainless steel processing vessels using only American made steel. Founded in 2014, the company began in a backyard shop by Jeff Lewis with a vision of creating a profitable company in Rural America by hiring excellent personnel, designing and fabricating products to exceed customers expectations and compensating craftsmen with living wages and profit sharing to financially sustain their families within the community. Mr. Lewis has 15+ years of experience as a craft beer brewer, a custom tank/vessel designer, fabrication and integration expert and business owner who initially founded Portland Kettle Works, a nationally recognized manufacturer of craft beer brewing equipment located in the Northwest. The Company has grown from 3 employees in 2015 to 12 in 2020. 
 
BrewBilt has been built by having strong relationships with local suppliers of raw materials, equipment and services in California, an aggressive referral network of satisfied customers nationwide, and an Advisory Board consisting of successful business leaders that provide valuable product feedback and business expertise to management. The craft brewing & spirits industries continue to grow worldwide. California is where craft brewing began and now has over 900 operating breweries – being centrally located in this booming market was a large draw for BrewBilt to locate its manufacturing facility in the Sierra foothills.

All BrewBilt products are designed and fabricated as food grade quality which enables the company to build vessels for food & beverage processing, the company is now building systems that are pharmaceutical grade for clients involved in distillation for the cannabis and hemp industries, thus making the revenue potential much greater. BrewBilt buys materials and components mostly from California suppliers which enables them to closely monitor quality, while the companys revenues are generated from sales to customers throughout the country. The company is aggressively pursuing international orders and has held meetings with the Center for International Trade Development and U.S. Commercial Service to develop international opportunities. Presently, a great deal of sales interest in coming from Mexico, Japan, Europe, and Australia. 
 
BrewBilt competes against a number of companies, most of which are selling mass produced equipment from China made from less costly inferior quality Chinese steel which often is neither food nor pharmaceutical grade quality. While this broader market is very competitive, there continues to be little competition and strong market demand for higher quality, custom designed, hand crafted and integrated systems that BrewBilt produces.
 
In July of 2016, BrewBilt moved from the small facility in Nevada City, CA to lease an eight thousand (8,000) square foot manufacturing facility in Grass Valley, CA. This facility was purchased by BrewBilt in January 2018 and upgraded with substantial tenant improvements. BrewBilt is prepared to expand again by leasing an additional seventy-six hundred (7,600) square feet in the same facility. BrewBilt obtains the majority of its leads through customer referrals and from online marketplaces. The companys website is being expanded for online sales to include online educational/marketing videos that feature the company and its expanded integrated product line for the cannabis and hemp industries. BrewBilt has also created distribution sales agreements with individuals and companies to represent BrewBilt in both the domestic and international markets.

Our Market Opportunity
 
The craft beer industry offers a value of $26 billion in the United States, yet it is still an area of the economy which offers untapped potential. It is one of the fastest-growing segments of the beverage manufacturing industry today. The amount of consumer interest has been nothing short of incredible. Growth rates in sales, employment opportunities, and the total volume of beer produced have all been in double-digit percentages since 2010.
 
At a time when the overall beer industry saw a decrease in sales of 1% in 2020, the craft beer industry saw 5% growth. 70% of the volume that is produced by active breweries for the industry provide regional sales in the United States. 22% of the organizations are classified as microbreweries. Approximately 6% are brewpubs, while 1% list themselves as a contract brewing organization.
 
In 2020, there were over 196 million barrels of beer produced for sale in the United States. This volume was a 1.2% decrease from the year before. The craft beer industry still saw a 5% increase in volume as well, producing 24.8 million barrels of beer.
 
There are four distinct craft beer industry market segments: microbreweries, brewpubs, contactor brewers, and regional crafters. Home-brewers are sometimes grouped in with this data as well.

Craft Beer Industry Trends and Analysis
 
Although the interest in the craft beer industry is far from gone, the opportunities for growth for new businesses may have already peaked. With thousands of new breweries operating across the United States and around the world, the market is becoming increasingly crowded with multiple products in all economies. Although saturation may still be sometime away, it is inevitable that there will be an increasing level of pullback that occurs as the industry matures.
 
The amount of deceleration that the craft beer industry experiences will likely be dependent upon how many consumers decide to shift from a macro-brewery to products to items produced by the firms which are able to survive. There is already a steep drop occurring for the largest beverage manufacturers in the sector, which means the most established names and highest quality products have an opportunity to continue growing at an impressive rate.
 
Industrial brewers have already taken notice of this trend. Anheuser-Busch InBev purchased Goose Island in 2011 for about $39 million, which was their first of numerous acquisitions that are similar. Large companies have numerous ways to push into the market instead of only relying on the pull of consumers.
 
Even then, we still anticipate a 5-year growth pattern averaging 4% annually through 2024, with the potential to extend that influence through to a 10-year forecast as well. Consumers are asking for better products with more flavor choices today, which means the craft beer industry is in the perfect position to cash in on this trend.
