Our Strategy
 
Our participation in the Live Production, Mil/Gov, and Satellite sectors allow us to offer a broad array of end-to-end, high-reliability, high-data-rate, long-range wireless video transmission solutions.
 
Applications in growing market segments, including in-game sports, video mobile feeds, real-time capture and display of footage from drones and other aerial platforms, and rapid-response electronic newsgathering operations, use our solutions.
 
We have incorporated the following key sector strategies to expand various markets for miniature wireless video products, including the educational sector, videographers, and video service providers. Additionally, introducing comprehensive end-to-end I.P. technology into traditional broadcast and media markets provides complete end-to-end solutions for the video surveillance market and turnkey satellite communications solutions to address the need for communications in challenging environments.
 
The successful integration of the IMT and Vislink product lines and subsequent rebranding as a single entity has allowed the Company to leverage its traditional strengths. We can now offer an expanded suite of products and services in the worldwide markets we operate. Integrating the IMT and Vislink product lines has enabled the Company to take advantage of the limited overlap in previous product offerings, sales channels, and market coverage between the two brands. For example, there was a substantial Vislink client base in international markets where IMT products had a limited presence. The IMT product portfolio, which was very strong among U.S. federal law enforcement and high-end sports broadcasting customers, has been augmented with additional solutions based on enhanced product configurations. Finally, Vislink has traditionally focused on licensed spectrum solutions where IMT has pioneered non-licensed spectrum for many applications. Combining Vislink Technologies’ shared spectrum and interference mitigation intellectual property with the expanded product lineup may provide an opening into new customer bases that currently do not have access to licensed spectrum.
