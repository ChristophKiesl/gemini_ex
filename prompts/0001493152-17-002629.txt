ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a commercial-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing next generation vaccines to address unmet needs in infectious disease and immuno-oncology. We currently manufacture our product, Sci-B-Vac™, a third generation hepatitis B (“HBV”) vaccine for adults, children and newborns, which is approved for use in Israel and 14 other countries, but Sci-B-Vac™ has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), Health Canada or the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”). The Sci-B-Vac™ vaccine has demonstrated safety and efficacy in over 300,000 patients in currently licensed markets. Several clinical trials have shown more rapid and higher rates of seroprotection with Sci-B-Vac™ than with GlaxoSmithKline’s Engerix-B®. Engerix-B® is one of the standards of care to prevent hepatitis B infection globally. We are currently developing a clinical program to obtain FDA and EMA market approvals for commercial sale of Sci-B-Vac™ in the United States and the European Union (the “EU”), respectively.
 
On February 7, 2017, the Company announced that it had received positive scientific advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA regarding our development path for our Sci-B-Vac™ vaccine in Europe. In its letter, the CHMP expressed its support of our proposed plan to proceed to the Phase III clinical studies of Sci-B-Vac™. The CHMP also agreed that the product information, as well as data from ongoing studies, supports the Phase III clinical studies and our planned filing of a market authorization application (“MAA”) for Sci-B-Vac™.
 
On February 22, 2017, the Company announced that the Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate (“BGTD”) of Health Canada expressed its general support and acceptance of the Company’s development path for its Sci-B-Vac™ vaccine, a prophylactic vaccine against hepatitis B, in a pre-Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) meeting. A complete CTA must be filed with and approved by BGTD, and all conditions of BGTD must be met, prior to the initiation of a clinical program in Canada. Given the extensive manufacturing data, licensed clinical efficacy and safety experience of Sci-B-Vac™, BGTD agreed in principle with the Company’s overall development strategy. In addition, BGTD agreed that the proposed Phase III program would satisfy the regulatory requirements for marketing authorization in Canada, supporting the indication for active immunization against hepatitis B in adults. The Company believes that Sci-B-Vac™ fills a significant gap in an unmet medical need to protect against hepatitis B, especially in older individuals who may not be protected with currently licensed hepatitis B vaccines.
 
In November 2016, we announced that 98.8% of patients were seroprotected at two months following the second dose of Sci-B-Vac™ in the Phase IV trial in Israel. The results were from an ongoing Phase IV postmarketing study to evaluate Sci-B-Vac™ in healthy adults. In its interim analysis, Sci-B-Vac™ was found to be well-tolerated and demonstrated rapid onset of protection against HBV. Seroprotection rates, the percent of patients who produced an antibody response capable of preventing an infection, were as follows:
 

● | 91.9% of study participants were seroprotected at Month 2, one month after receiving a second dose of Sci-B-Vac™. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 98.8% of participants were seroprotected at Month 3, two months after receiving a second dose of Sci-B-Vac™, and prior to receiving a third dose. 

 
We believe that this demonstrates that Sci-B-Vac™ can safely and reliably be used to prevent HBV infection. The results add to a growing body of evidence that suggests persons receiving Sci-B-Vac™ may develop seroprotection against HBV after receiving just two doses of the vaccine. This Phase IV study is for routine quality control purposes and to support the existing licensure of Sci-B-Vac™ in Israel. The study is further designed to validate our new in-house reference standard vaccine for routine quality control purposes, in accordance with the European Pharmacopeia and Israeli Ministry of Health guidelines. The study also seeks to characterize the safety and immunogenicity of Sci-B-Vac™ to further support planned pivotal clinical trials in Europe and North America. We will continue to gather and analyze study data, with final results anticipated in the second half of 2017.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary in Rehovot, Israel, currently manufactures and sells Sci-B-Vac™.
 
We are also developing an enveloped “Virus Like Particle” or “eVLP” vaccine platform that allows for the design of enveloped virus-like particle vaccines that closely mimic the target viruses. We are advancing a pipeline of eVLP vaccines, with lead programs in human cytomegalovirus (“CMV”), an infection that, while common, can lead to serious complications in babies and people with weak immune systems, and is involved in progression of glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”), which is a form of brain cancer. In September 2016, we completed the enrollment and initial dosing of 128 participants in a Phase I clinical study to evaluate our preventative CMV vaccine candidate. The Phase I study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of our CMV vaccine candidate in 128 healthy CMV-negative adults. The study will also measure levels of vaccine-induced CMV neutralizing antibodies that may prevent CMV infection. Preliminary results are anticipated in the first half of 2017.

We are also advancing our LPV™ Thermostability Platform, a proprietary formulation and process that allows vaccines and biologics to preserve stability, potency, and safety. We may also seek to in-license clinical-stage vaccines that we believe complement our product portfolio, in addition to technologies that may supplement our therapeutic vaccination efforts in immuno-oncology.
 
We operate in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we raised an aggregate of $24.1 million in equity financing and an additional $13.2 million of debt financing to support our vaccine development programs, to continue the advancement of our research programs and for other general corporate purposes. Since inception, we have collectively raised approximately $124.7 million in total equity and debt financing for those purposes.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of British Columbia by Memorandum of Association on April 9, 1965 under the name “Alice Arm Molybendum Co. Ltd.” On October 21, 1965, we changed our name to “Alice Arm Mining Ltd.” and subsequently, on July 13, 1975, changed our name to “New Congress Resources Ltd.” On January 12, 1983, we changed our name to “Levon Resources Ltd.”
 
On July 9, 2015, the Company, then known as Levon Resources Ltd. (“Levon”), completed a plan of arrangement (the “Levon Merger”) pursuant to which SciVac Ltd. (“SciVac”), an Israel based company, completed a reverse takeover of Levon. Levon changed its name from Levon Resources Ltd. to SciVac Therapeutics Inc. Other than approximately CAD $27 million in cash retained by us, all of our other assets and liabilities were transferred or assumed by 1027949 BC Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary (“BC Ltd.”). Additionally, upon consummation of the Levon Merger, each of our shareholders received 0.5 common shares of BC Ltd., resulting in our shareholders holding 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of BC Ltd; therefore, we no longer own any equity interest in BC Ltd.
 
On July 14, 2015, our common shares commenced trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) under the symbol “VAC” and our common shares also began to be quoted on the OTCQX marketplace (the “OTCQX”) maintained by the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol “SVACF.”
 
On October 26, 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which we agreed to acquire VBI Vaccines (Delaware) Inc. (“VBI DE”) by way of a merger transaction. On May 6, 2016, we completed our acquisition of VBI DE, pursuant to which Seniccav Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, merged with and into VBI DE, with VBI DE continuing as the surviving corporation and as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “VBI-SciVac Merger”). Upon completion of the VBI-SciVac Merger, we (then named “SciVac Therapeutics Inc.”) changed our name to “VBI Vaccines Inc.” and received approval for the listing of our common shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Our common shares commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market at the opening of trading on May 9, 2016 under our new name and the symbol “VBIV.” Following the effective time of the VBI-SciVac Merger, our common shares began to trade on the TSX under the new symbol “VBV.”

Background of VBI DE
 
VBI DE was originally established in 1970 as Paulson Capital Corp., an Oregon corporation (“Paulson Oregon”), which began as a holding company whose operating subsidiary, Paulson Investment Company, Inc. (“PIC”), was a full service brokerage firm. Effective March 20, 2014, Paulson Oregon changed its state of incorporation from the State of Oregon to the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 20, 2014 by and between Paulson Oregon, and Paulson Oregon’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Paulson Capital (Delaware) Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Paulson Delaware”). As a result of the Reincorporation, Paulson Oregon became Paulson Delaware, its name became “Paulson Capital (Delaware) Corp.” and Paulson Oregon ceased to exist. Paulson Oregon’s shareholders approved the Reincorporation pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger at Paulson Oregon’s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders held on November 8, 2013.
 
On July 25, 2014, Variation Biotechnologies (US), Inc. (“VBI US”) completed its merger (the “PLCC Merger”) with VBI Acquisition Corp. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of VBI DE, whereby Merger Sub merged with and into VBI US, with VBI US continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the PLCC Merger, VBI US was acquired by, and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VBI DE and VBI DE changed its name to VBI Vaccines Inc. and then subsequently changed its name to VBI Vaccines (Delaware) Inc. on July 19, 2016.
 
The PLCC Merger was consummated pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated May 8, 2014 (the “PLCC Merger Agreement”), by and among VBI US, VBI DE and Merger Sub. The PLCC Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by VBI DE’s board of directors on May 1, 2014 and by VBI DE’s stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders held on July 14, 2014.
 
At the effective time of the VBI-SciVac Merger, the stockholders of VBI DE received our common shares which, together with options to purchase shares of VBI DE common stock that were converted into options to purchase our common shares represented approximately 46.2% of our common shares on a fully diluted basis after the VBI-SciVac Merger.
 
Subsidiaries
 
SciVac, located in Rehovot, Israel, is our wholly-owned subsidiary that was incorporated on April 18, 2005 pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law (1999), as amended. SciVac currently manufactures and sells our lead product, Sci-B-Vac™, a third generation hepatitis B vaccine for adults, children and newborns.
 
SciVac USA, LLC, located in Miami, Florida, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SciVac and was organized on November 26, 2014 in the State of Florida.
 
VBI US, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of VBI DE and was incorporated on December 18, 2006 in the State of Delaware.
 
Variation Biotechnologies Inc. (“VBI Cda”), located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of VBI US, was incorporated on August 24, 2001 under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is the primary research facility of VBI DE. VBI Cda was founded in 2001 as a spin-out company from an ongoing research collaboration between researchers at the University of California, Davis and the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario. VBI Cda was involved in the early stage development of vaccine discovery platforms and adjuvant technologies. From 2001 until 2006, VBI Cda’s major stockholders included its founders and several individual “angel” investors. On December 28, 2006, VBI US closed a financing of its Series A Preferred Stock, which resulted in the opening of VBI US’s U.S. headquarters with VBI Cda as its Canadian research-focused subsidiary.

Contractual Arrangements
 
Kevelt AS
 
Prior to the Levon Merger, one of our directors was also the chairman of the board of Kevelt AS (“Kevelt”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OAO Pharmsynthez (“Pharmsynthez”), and was also the chairman of the board of Pharmsynthez. Following the Levon Merger, in accordance with the merger agreement, this director resigned. On April 26, 2013, SciVac entered into a Development and Manufacturing Agreement (“DMA”) with Kevelt, pursuant to which SciVac agreed to develop the manufacturing process for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of certain materials in drug substance form for an aggregate amount of $4.3 million. The original term of the DMA was for a period of one year commencing April 26, 2013, but pursuant to the terms of the DMA, the term automatically renews thereafter for successive additional one-year periods, unless the parties fail to agree on the terms applicable to any renewal term and either party provides at least 30 days prior written notice of non-renewal to the other. On July 30, 2016, we received a letter of termination from Kevelt, in part containing a request for refund of the $2.5 million balance it had previously funded. We reclassified this amount to other current liabilities as of June 30, 2016. We have evaluated the DMA with respect to the termination, applied deferred costs, deposits and estimated effort incurred to-date related to the project and have proposed a settlement to Kevelt of approximately $0.8 million. On December 13, 2016, SciVac received a letter of demand from Kevelt’s legal counsel, which reiterated the termination of the DMA and the demand to reimburse Kevelt the amount of $2.5 million, while refuting the Company’s claims. It also demanded that the Company provide documentation evidencing its allegations that only $0.8 million is owed to Kevelt. On March 13, 2017, the Company received a new demand letter from Kevelt's Israeli legal counsel, which, among other things, reiterated the previous demands but adding that if the Company does not respond within 7 days, it will commence arbitration proceedings in accordance with the terms of the DMA. Also on March 13, 2017, the Company provided its legal counsel with technical documents and on March 14, 2017, the Company provided its counsel with additional technical information, which is intended to refute Kevelt's arguments regarding the completion of the phases as alleged by Kevelt. The Company's legal counsel is scheduled to speak with representatives of the Company on March 15, 2017 to review the above-mentioned documentation received from the Company and in order to prepare the appropriate response to Kevelt's attorneys.
Ferring License Agreement 
 
Our manufactured and marketed product, Sci-B-Vac™, is a recombinant third generation hepatitis B vaccine whose sales and territories are governed by a license agreement (“Ferring License Agreement”) with Ferring International Center S.A. (“Ferring”). Under the Ferring License Agreement, we are committed to pay Ferring royalties equal to 7% of net sales (as defined therein). Royalty payments of $6 and $21 were recorded in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In addition, we are committed to pay 30% of any and all non-royalty consideration, in any form, received by us from such sub-licensees (other than consideration based on net sales for which a royalty is due under the Ferring License Agreement), provided that the payment of 30% shall not apply to a grant of rights in or relating to: (i) the Territory (as such term was defined prior to an amendment dated January 24, 2005); or (ii) the Berna Territory (as defined therein).
 
We are to pay Ferring the above-mentioned royalties on a country-by-country basis until the date which is ten (10) years after the date of commencement of the first royalty year in respect of such country (the “License Period”). Upon expiry of the full term of the first License Period having commenced, we have the option to extend the Ferring License Agreement in respect of all the countries that still make up the Territory (as defined in the Ferring License Agreement) (as from the respective date of expiry) for an additional seven (7) years by payment to Ferring of a one-time lump sum payment of $100. Royalties will continue to be payable for the duration of the extended License Periods. When the license has been in effect for, and elapsed after, a seventeen (17) year License Period with respect to a country in the Territory, we will thereafter have a royalty-free license to market (as defined in the Ferring License Agreement) in such country and when all the License Periods have expired in each country in the Territory, a royalty-free license to manufacture the product in India and the People’s Republic of China.
 
SciGen Singapore
 
Under an assignment and assumption agreement, we are required to pay royalties to SciGen Ltd. (“SciGen”) equal to 5% of Net Sales of Sci-B-Vac™ product sales (as defined in such agreement). Royalty payments of $4 and $15 were recorded in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
 
eVLP Technology
 
We are engaged in the inbound and outbound licensing of key intellectual property (“IP”). We identified the need for a vaccine antigen discovery and design platform and, as indicated in the discussion titled “Subsidiaries”, through that certain sale and purchase agreement entered into on July 18, 2011 (the “Sale and Purchase Agreement”) among VBI Cda and ePixis SA (“ePixis”) and the shareholders of ePixis (collectively, the “Sellers”), acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ePixis in order to obtain access to its exclusive rights to key IP covering its “enveloped Virus Like Particle” or “eVLP” vaccine platform (the “Technology”), including patents (the “Acquired Patents”) covering the Technology. We paid a purchase price of €400 (approximately $450) for the ePixis shares and approximately $75 in related transaction costs. VBI Cda also agreed to make certain contingent payments to the Sellers as follows:

If any eVLP Product is commercialized by one or more sublicensees, we have agreed to make the following payments to the Sellers:
 

● | On the date that Cumulative Net Sales by us or any sublicensees of the eVLP Products equal or exceed €25,000 in the aggregate, we must pay to the Sellers €750, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €375; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | On the date that Cumulative Net Sales made by us or any sublicensees of the eVLP Products equal or exceed €50,000 in the aggregate, we must pay to the Sellers €750, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €375; 
● | On the date that Cumulative Net Sales made by us or any sublicensees of the eVLP Products equal or exceed €75,000 in the aggregate, we must pay to the Sellers €1,000, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €500; and 
● | On the date that Cumulative Net Sales made by us or any sublicensees of the eVLP Products equal or exceed €100,000 in the aggregate, we must pay to the Sellers €1,000, or, if there are no longer any issued and valid claims of the Acquired Patents in effect at the date such event occurs, €500. 

 
Included in the eVLP Acquired Patents were patents (the “UPMC Patents”) co-owned by L’Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (“UPMC”), and the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (“INSERM”), both in Paris, France. In July 2006, ePixis entered into a license agreement (the “ePixis License Agreement”) with UPMC, INSERM and L’école Normale Supérieure de Lyon (collectively the “Licensor”) pursuant to which the Licensor granted to ePixis an exclusive license (with the right to sublicense with written consent from UPMC) to exploit the UPMC Patents for the purpose of developing, promoting and marketing products within the United States, Japan, Canada, and Europe until the invalidation of the last of the UPMC Patents, including any supplementary protection certificates. Pursuant to the ePixis License Agreement, ePixis was to pay certain fees to the Licensor based on net sales (as defined in the ePixis License Agreement) of products developed from the UPMC Patents, sublicensing income based on net sales (“Sublicensing Payments”) and one-time payments (“Lump Sum Payments”) for each product developed from the UPMC Patents. ePixis also agreed to reimburse UPMC for fees and costs related to filing and maintaining the patent applications.
 
On July 12, 2011, the parties to the ePixis License Agreement entered into the first amendment to the ePixis License Agreement (the “ePixis Amendment”). The ePixis Amendment authorized the transfer of the ePixis License Agreement to us and laid out new financial terms and conditions for the rights granted under the ePixis License Agreement.

The ePixis Amendment provides that the fees to be paid to the Licensor by ePixis on net sales of eVLP Products based on the UPMC Patents will be 1.75% of net sales for annual sales between €0 and €50,000, 1% of net sales for annual sales between €50,000 and €100,000, and 0.75% of net sales for annual sales in excess of €100,000. Pursuant to the ePixis Amendment, Lump Sum Payments would be made as follows:
 

● | €50 when the results from pre-clinical studies are sufficient to allow a product to enter a regulatory filing similar to an IND or a similar entity in a country other than the United States; this milestone was met and paid during the year ended December 31, 2016; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | €150 when the results from pre-clinical studies are sufficient to allow a product into a clinical phase, including Phase I-II clinical studies; this milestone was met and paid during the year ended December 31, 2016; 
● | €250 when a product enters Phase II clinical studies, an event that is defined by the enrollment of the first patient; 
● | €500 when a product enters Phase III clinical studies; and 
● | €1,000 when a product is first marketed. 

 
Sublicensing Payments under the ePixis Amendment were revised as follows: 25% of any amounts received by ePixis for the sublicense if the sublicense is entered into prior to the start of Phase I clinical studies; 10% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into during Phase I clinical studies and prior to the start of Phase II clinical studies; 7% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into during Phase II clinical studies and prior to the start of Phase III clinical studies, and 5% of any amounts received by ePixis if the sublicense is entered into after the start of Phase III clinical studies. There was no change to the requirement that ePixis reimburse UPMC for fees and costs related to filing and maintaining the patent applications.
 
The parties may terminate the ePixis License Agreement, as amended, by mutual agreement. There is also a cancellation right that may be exercised in the event of breach. UPMC may terminate the ePixis License Agreement if we, among other things, declare bankruptcy; do not put forth reasonable effort or are unable to develop and market the products, and, in particular, if we suspend the development of the products for more than six months; our inability to make the payments required by the ePixis License Agreement; lack of sales of a product, or lack of a signed sub-license agreement within one year from the date of acquiring AMM (Autorisation de mise sur le marché - Regulation of Therapeutic Goods) authorization, or the necessary equivalent authorization for the use of the products; and lack of sales of a product for more than two years after the initial marketing has taken place. During the year-ended December 31, 2016, VBI Cda paid UPMC €200 in milestone payments related to CMV Phase I clinical trial approval and start.
 
Principal Products
 
Our principal products include our Sci-B-Vac™ vaccine candidate, CMV vaccine candidate, eVLP Platform and LPV vaccine platform.
 
Sci-B-Vac™ Vaccine Candidate
 
Our Sci-B-Vac™ product is a third generation HBV vaccine for adults, children and newborns, approved for use in Israel and 14 other countries. Sci-B-Vac™ has not yet been approved by the FDA, Health Canada or the EMA. The Sci-B-Vac™ vaccine has demonstrated safety and efficacy in over 300,000 patients in currently licensed markets. Several clinical trials have shown more rapid and higher rates of seroprotection with Sci-B-Vac™ than with GSK’s Engerix-B®. Engerix-B® is one of the standards of care to prevent hepatitis B infection globally. We are nearing the completion of a Phase IV clinical study in Israel. The purpose of this study was to confirm a new in-house reference standard for regulatory and quality control purposes. We are currently developing a clinical program to obtain FDA and EMA market approvals for commercial sale of Sci-B-Vac™ in the U.S. and the EU, respectively.
 
Our Sci-B-Vac™ is a “third generation” vaccine, distinguished from previous generations in that Sci-B-Vac™ (i) is produced in mammalian cells (CHO cells) and (ii) contains more of the proteins, or surface antigens, naturally occurring on the outer surface of the hepatitis B virus.
 
In contrast to previous vaccines, which contain only one surface antigen, the “S” antigen, Sci-B-Vac™ contains the “S” antigen plus the “preS1” and “preS2” surface antigens. The composition of Sci-B-Vac™ therefore provides more opportunities for the immune system to respond with antibodies, or neutralizing antibodies, which can recognize one of these components of the hepatitis B particle.

Because the Sci-B-Vac™ active component displays proteins substantially similar to those found on the outer surface of the naturally occurring hepatitis B virus, we believe that Sci-B-Vac™ could be more potent and immunogenic (capable of conferring immunity) than other existing yeast-derived HBV vaccines, such as GSK’s Engerix-B®.
 
Several clinical studies conducted by us have demonstrated that Sci-B-Vac™ possesses the following benefits relating to the prevention of the hepatitis B virus:
 

● | Sci-B-Vac™ has been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic in adults, children and newborn infants; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In several trials, the protection obtained by vaccination, or seroprotection, was faster, and anti-hepatitis B virus antibody concentration was higher in a larger percentage of vaccinated individuals, in each case when compared to current yeast-derived vaccines. In addition, seroprotection (the attainment of immunologically protective levels of anti-hepatitis B virus antibodies) was induced with only 25-50% of the recommended dose for currently U.S.- licensed HBV vaccines; and 
● | Sci-B-Vac™ generated an adequate immune memory for long-term protection against hepatitis B. 

 
Additionally, preliminary results, such as from investigator-initiated academic studies, suggest that:
 

● | Sci-B-Vac™ generated superior to Engerix-B® immune response in overweight individuals; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sci-B-Vac™ induced a protective immunity in end-stage renal disease (“ESRD”) patients who did not respond to previous vaccination with currently available vaccines and who were undergoing dialysis; and 
● | Sci-B-Vac™ could have particular clinical benefits in special subsets, such as immunosuppressed patients and special at-risk groups of non-responders. 

 
Sci-B-Vac™ is generally well-tolerated by patients. During the clinical development and trials of Sci-B-Vac™, approximately 1% of the patients experienced local reactions at the injection site (as commonly observed with the use of most vaccines). The injection site reactions included soreness, pain, tenderness, pruritus, which is itchiness, erythema, which is redness, ecchymosis, which is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath the skin, swelling, warmth and nodule formation. These reactions were generally mild and were resolved within two days after vaccination. Additionally fatigue, weakness, headache, fever, malaise, nausea, diarrhea, pharyngitis, which is inflammation of the pharynx, and upper respiratory infection were observed.
 
Based on the clinical data collected to date, we intend to bypass the Phase II trial in the United States and Europe with the consent of the FDA and EMA, respectively, and commence pivotal Phase III clinical studies for prevention of the hepatitis B virus. We are in the process of finalizing the protocols, negotiating several clinical trial agreements and identifying clinical sites for these Phase III clinical studies.
 
On February 7, 2017, we announced that we received positive scientific advice from the CHMP of the EMA regarding our development path for our Sci-B-Vac™ vaccine in Europe. In its letter, the CHMP expressed its support of our proposed plan to proceed to the Phase III clinical studies of Sci-B-Vac™. The CHMP also agreed that the product information, as well as data from ongoing studies, supports the Phase III clinical studies and our planned filing of an MAA for Sci-B-Vac™.
 
On February 22, 2017, we announced that the Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate (“BGTD”) of Health Canada expressed its general support and acceptance of our development path for our Sci-B-Vac™ vaccine, a prophylactic vaccine against hepatitis B, in a pre-Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) meeting. A complete CTA must be filed with and approved by BGTD, and all conditions of BGTD must be met, prior to the initiation of a clinical program in Canada. Given the extensive manufacturing data, licensed clinical efficacy and safety experience of Sci-B-Vac™, BGTD agreed in principle with our overall development strategy. In addition, BGTD agreed that the proposed Phase III program would satisfy the regulatory requirements, for marketing authorization in Canada, supporting the indication for active immunization against hepatitis B in adults. We believe that Sci-B-Vac™ fills a significant gap in an unmet medical need to protect against hepatitis B, especially in older individuals who may not be protected with currently licensed hepatitis B vaccines.

CMV Vaccine Candidate
 
We are also developing an experimental CMV vaccine using our eVLP vaccine platform. We are advancing our pipeline of eVLP vaccines, with lead programs in human CMV, an infection that, while common, can lead to serious complications in babies and people with weak immune systems, and is involved in progression of GBM, which is a form of brain cancer. The vaccine is based on the CMV glycoprotein B (“gB”) antigen and is adjuvanted with aluminum phosphate. The CMV vaccine has shown promise in early preclinical animal models, including rabbits and mice, with the ability to generate anti-CMV antibodies and CMV neutralizing responses in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells.
 
In September 2016, we completed the enrollment and initial dosing of 128 participants in the Phase I clinical study to evaluate our preventative CMV vaccine candidate. The third and final vaccination was administered February 2017. The Phase I study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of our CMV vaccine candidate in 128 healthy CMV-negative adults. The study will also measure levels of vaccine-induced CMV neutralizing antibodies that may prevent CMV infection. Preliminary results are anticipated in the first half of 2017.
 
eVLP Vaccine Platform
 
On August 11, 2011, VBI Cda acquired the eVLP vaccine technology through the acquisition of ePixis. The eVLP vaccine technology allows for the expression of envelope glyco-proteins within a lipid-bilayer membrane of a virus like particle (“VLP”). The technology enables the synthetic manufacture of an “enveloped” virus like particle, or “eVLP”. Many viruses are “enveloped” in that they are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane. Such viruses display antigenic proteins in the surface of their “envelope” which can be targets for vaccine development. The ability to synthetically manufacture an ‘enveloped’ virus like particle is different from previously developed VLP technologies, which did not include the lipid bilayer membrane, and thus these technologies were unable to express antigenic proteins within an “envelope” as they occur in nature. In addition to the $450 initial payment for the technology and $75 in related transaction costs, we paid approximately $211 and $110 in milestone payments under the e-Pixis Licensing Agreement in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
We expect to develop additional vaccine targets based on this platform, either through a partnership, or internally.
 
LPV Vaccine Platform
 
Vaccines are typically sensitive to fluctuations in temperature that can degrade, destroy or inactivate the potency of a vaccine and introduce safety risks. As a consequence, 90% of vaccines are transported through a “cold-chain” of temperature controlled environments, transportation and storage. Our Lipid Particle Vaccine technology, or “LPV”, is a vaccine formulation technology that enables the thermostabilization of vaccines through a proprietary formulation and freeze-drying process. The technology is constituted by three lipids, monopalmitoylglycerol (“MPG”), dihexadecyl phosphate (“DCP”) and cholesterol mixed in a proprietary ratio with vaccine antigen using a patented method. The resulting mixture is then lyophilized (freeze dried) and can be stored for extended periods of time outside of the cold-chain.
 
We have active collaborations with a number of vaccine innovators and manufacturers, including with Sanofi and GSK, two of the leading vaccine producers in the world. Sanofi is currently evaluating our LPV technology with one of its lead vaccine assets. Under the terms of the Sanofi Agreement, Sanofi can acquire certain rights to extend its use of the LPV technology to additional vaccine assets. Recently, we also executed the GSK Agreement, which provides GSK with the rights to negotiate an exclusive license to the LPV technology for use within a defined field.
 
In the normal course of our business, we assess and consider potential acquisition, or collaboration opportunities to gain access to, technologies or assets that are adjacent to our core competencies of immunology and formulation development. We are currently exploring this technology through partnerships with other third-party collaborators.
 
Description of Operations
 
We are headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with our manufacturing facility in Rehovot, Israel and our research facility in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The Cambridge headquarters allows us to leverage our location in a biotechnology hub, and provides us with access to experienced consultants and executive level talent.
 
We operate a proprietary, mammalian cell-derived vaccine manufacturing facility in Rehovot, Israel, which we use to manufacture Sci-B-Vac™. The facility was built in December 2006 and is good manufacturing practices (“GMP”) certified by the Israeli Ministry of Health (“MoH”). It has also received MoH authorization to release vaccine batches to export markets. In 2013, the EU entered into an agreement with Israel regarding conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products. This agreement recognizes Israel’s industrial standards as being equivalent to EU standards. It covers products for human and veterinary use (medicinal products, active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients) and procedures related to GMP. The agreement means that Israel and the EU recognize each other’s GMP inspection conclusions, manufacturing and import authorizations and certification of conformity of batches without the need for re-testing at import and official-control-authority batch release; however, our facility will have to pass FDA inspection prior to marketing Sci-B-Vac™ in the United States.

Current production capabilities satisfy our current manufacturing requirements for domestic and export markets. However, in the event we receive FDA and/or EMA approval for Sci-B-Vac™, our production requirements may increase beyond our current production capabilities, and we may enter into agreements with various third parties for the manufacture of Sci-B-Vac™.
 
The Canadian research site benefits from its location in Canada’s National Capital Region, providing us with access to world-class research facilities at reasonable rates. This helps keep the unit cost of doing research lower compared to other locations in Canada or the U.S. VBI Cda’s active research collaboration with the Canadian federal government’s National Research Council (“NRC”) provides its staff with on-site access to the NRC’s animal facility for greater control over the testing of our vaccine candidates. NRC staff manages the general animal husbandry and maintenance requirements for VBI Cda’s research operations.
 
The three sites collaborate efficiently through the use of a unified information technology infrastructure and web-based video-conferencing services.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We maintain a business development function responsible for inbound and outbound licensing of our IP portfolio. We do not have a traditional sales and marketing function and distribute Sci-B-Vac™ in approved countries through a network of distributors.
Customers
 
Our customers for Sci-B-Vac™ vaccines are mainly physicians and pharmacists in markets where the product is approved. Through SciVac, services are also made available to the biotechnology industry in Israel pursuant to an agreement with the Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel and ancillary to the core vaccine development and manufacturing focus.
 
Our target customer base consists of other vaccine and biologics developers who may be interested in gaining access to our proprietary technologies and/or vaccine candidates.
 
Competitors
 
Our products and product candidates face, and will continue to face, intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as academic and research institutions. We compete in an industry that is characterized by: (i) rapid technological change; (ii) evolving industry standards; (iii) emerging competition; and (iv) new product introductions. Competitors have existing products and technologies that will compete with our product candidates and technologies and may develop and commercialize additional products and technologies that will compete with our product candidates and technologies. Because several competing companies and institutions have greater financial resources than us, they may be able to: (i) provide broader services and product lines; (ii) make greater investments in research and development (“R&D”); and (iii) carry on larger R&D initiatives. Competitors also have greater development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking nonclinical and clinical testing of products, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. They also have greater name recognition and better access to customers. Our chief competitors in the field of HBV vaccines include companies such as Pfizer, Dynavax Technologies, Merck & Co. (“Merck”), Sanofi Pasteur and GSK.
 
We face general market competition from several subsectors of the vaccine development field, including: (i) large, multinational pharmaceutical companies including Sanofi, GSK, Merck, and Pfizer, Inc., (ii) mid-size pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotechnology companies including Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Dynavax Technologies Corporation, Genocea Biosciences Inc., Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Vical, Inc. and Hookipa Biotech AG, and (iii) academic and not-for-profit vaccine researchers and developers including the National Institutes of Health and Butantan Institute. The industry is typified by extensive collaboration, licensing and merger and acquisition activity despite the intense competition.

Within the CMV vaccine space, we have several key competitors, some of whom are further advanced with their CMV vaccine development, as compared to us. Among these, Merck has a highly potent vaccine based on a replication of a defective CMV virus with an adjuvant and is completing a Phase I clinical trial. Additionally, Hookipa Biotech AG has initiated clinical development of HB - 101 a prophylactic CMV vaccine based on its Vaxwave™ technology. Despite this competition, we believe there are reasons why our CMV vaccine may have some advantages, including that: (i) our vaccine is based on the successful VLP category of vaccines, which has recently been used in the successful introduction of cervical cancer vaccines, (ii) it is currently expected to use aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant, which has a more extensive history of safety through its inclusion in several pediatric vaccines, and (iii) it has demonstrated competitive anti-CMV responses in preclinical animal models. We believe that these advantages merit advancement of the product candidate, but do not guarantee its success.
 
Suppliers, Contractors and Collaborations
 
Suppliers 
 
We currently rely on a single source for our supply of vials and certain reagents required for the manufacture of Sci-B-Vac™. Currently, we do not have supply agreements with these vendors and all orders are handled through individual purchase orders on an order-by-order basis. Alternative sources from which we can obtain our supply of these materials exist. However, we may not be able to find alternative suppliers in a timely manner that would provide supplies of these materials at acceptable quantities and prices, if at all. Any interruption in the supply of these materials would disrupt our ability to manufacture Sci-B-Vac™ and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Contractors
 
We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations (“CROs”) for clinical trials and with vendors for research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice.
 
We rely on a number of key contractors to characterize and release Sci-B-Vac™ for the Israel and other markets. While alternative contractors exist for these services, we may not be able to transition to alternative contractors in a manner that does not disrupt the normal course of manufacturing operations and the supply of Sci-B-Vac™.
 
Our novel vaccine development efforts depend on a number of key suppliers to continue our research operations. We have identified the following parties as key suppliers of reagents, technology or expertise which impact our development plans with our CMV vaccine candidate:
 

● | UPMC is the owner of the eVLP vaccine platform IP portfolio to which we have an exclusive license. Under the terms of the ePixis License Agreement, as amended, we are required to pay royalties for successful products developed using the IP for as long as claims remain valid in a given jurisdiction. This patent portfolio has claims that are expected to remain valid until 2022 in the United States and 2021 in other countries, after which time we are no longer obligated to compensate UPMC for development of vaccines based on the UPMC IP portfolio. After that time, the remaining patent protection of the CMV vaccine will be based on patent applications filed by us, which if granted, would provide patent protection extending until 2032. There can be no assurance that any such patent applications will be granted or, if granted, be enforceable, and they may be amended to reduce the scope of patent claims. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have collaborated with NRC on various vaccine projects since 2004 and have a long history of successful partnerships including several NRC-funded industrial research grants. The NRC is the owner of a proprietary cell line (HEK-293-NRC) that we are using for production of our eVLP-based CMV vaccine. VBI Cda and the NRC have signed a research agreement that provides VBI Cda with access to NRC facilities and expertise for the advancement of the CMV vaccine program. Supplementary to such research agreement, we have negotiated terms for a non-exclusive license to the HEK-293-NRC cell line. Under these terms, we will be required to pay success-based milestone payments as the CMV vaccine advances into clinical development and first commercial sales. These terms also provide that no additional royalties on product sales will be required. We signed this licensing agreement in 2014.

● | Key Reagent Suppliers: Our CMV eVLP-based vaccines characterization and release assays each require specialized reagents. Once clinical development begins, we must ensure consistency and reliability of each reagent in its key quality control and release assays. Many of these reagents are being produced by, and therefore are in our control. Several key reagents including reference proteins and growth media are provided by third parties and can impact preclinical and clinical Phase I start timelines. We have secured sufficient quantities of third party reference proteins and we are working with our vendor, Paragon Bioservices (“Paragon”), to secure sufficient growth media for Phase I clinical trial supply. Supply of these key reagents remains a risk. See “Risk Factors” on page 19. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, depend on subcontractor arrangements to facilitate the completion of our research programs. For example, Paragon has manufactured clinical batches of our lead CMV vaccine candidate pursuant to the terms of a GMP-Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) dated September 26, 2014. In addition, on May 12, 2016, VBI Cda executed a new Statement of Work (“SOW”) as part of the Services Agreement related to the process development and manufacture of an eVLP-based GBM vaccine candidate. The term of the Services Agreement is indefinite, although either party may terminate the Services Agreement upon written notice to the other party. The Company continues to explore alternative sources of product supply. 

Collaborations
 
We also enter into contracts in the normal course of business with vendors for preclinical safety and research studies, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and do not include any minimum purchase commitments, and therefore are cancelable contracts.

● | On April 2, 2015, VBI Cda entered into a Collaboration and Option License Agreement (the “Sanofi Agreement”) with Sanofi Vaccines Technologies S.A.S., a company organized under the laws of France (“Sanofi”). Certain provisions of the Sanofi Agreement have not been publicly disclosed in accordance with an Order Granting Confidential Treatment issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on June 23, 2015. The purpose of the Sanofi Agreement is to allow Sanofi to evaluate the feasibility of using VBI Cda’s LPV technology and expertise to reformulate a Sanofi vaccine candidate (the “Sanofi Project Vaccine”) to provide improved stability (the “Sanofi Project”). The term of the Sanofi Project began on the date of receipt by VBI Cda of Sanofi materials and continues for a defined period unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties (the “Sanofi Project Period”). In consideration of VBI Cda granting the Sanofi Option and in partial acknowledgment of the past research and development costs incurred by VBI Cda in its development efforts, Sanofi (A) paid cash consideration to VBI Cda upon execution of the Sanofi Agreement and (B) will reimburse VBI Cda on a monthly basis for costs associated with research and development work, including internal and external expenses and costs associated with production of the Sanofi Project Vaccine, such as biological materials (subject to pre-approval by Sanofi), up to a maximum amount. The Sanofi Agreement may be terminated (i) by either party in the event the other party has materially breached or defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations under the Sanofi Agreement, and such default has continued for 90 days after written notice thereof was provided to the breaching party by the non-breaching party, with the termination becoming effective at the end of such 90 day period unless the breaching party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of the 90 day period; (ii) if involuntary proceedings against a party are instituted in bankruptcy under any insolvency law, or a receiver or custodian is appointed for such party, or proceedings are instituted against such party for corporate reorganization or the dissolution of such party, which proceedings, if involuntary, shall not have been dismissed within 60 days after the date of filing, or if such party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or substantially all of the assets of such party are seized or attached and not released within 60 days thereafter, the other party may immediately terminate the Sanofi Agreement effective upon notice of such termination; (iii) by Sanofi during the Sanofi Project Period, as defined in the Sanofi Agreement, at any time with 45 days written notice to VBI Cda; and (iv) by Sanofi at any time during the Sanofi Option Period, as defined in the Sanofi Agreement. VBI and Sanofi are currently completing the research plan in accordance with the Sanofi Agreement.

● | On February 8, 2016, VBI Cda entered into an Evaluation and Option Agreement (the “GSK Agreement”) with GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA, a company registered in Belgium (“GSK”). Certain provisions of the GSK Agreement have not been publicly disclosed in accordance with an Order Granting Confidential Treatment issued by the SEC on March 14, 2016. The purpose of the GSK Agreement is to allow GSK to evaluate the feasibility of using VBI Cda’s LPV™ technology and expertise to formulate a vaccine candidate using GSK’s technology (the “GSK Evaluation”). The term of the GSK Agreement begins on the Effective Date, which is defined as February 8, 2016, and unless earlier terminated or mutually extended in writing, the GSK Agreement will expire upon the expiration or termination of the GSK Option (defined below) or, in the event that the GSK Option is timely exercised, until a sponsored collaboration agreement or a license agreement is executed by the parties. VBI Cda granted to GSK an option (the “GSK Option”) to negotiate and enter into either (i) a collaboration and option agreement in the field (the “GSK Field”), that will include an exclusive option for GSK to be granted a worldwide exclusive license with the right to grant sublicenses to the Company’s LPV technology in the GSK Field (a “Sponsored Collaboration and Option Agreement”); or move directly to (ii) an exclusive, worldwide license with the right to grant sublicenses to the Company’s LPV technology in the GSK Field (a “GSK License Agreement”). In consideration of VBI Cda granting the GSK Option and the GSK Evaluation to be conducted pursuant to the GSK Agreement, GSK paid to VBI Cda certain fees upon execution of the GSK Agreement. The GSK Agreement may be terminated (i) by either party, in the event the other party has breached the terms and conditions of the GSK Agreement, and such breach has continued for 30 days after written notice thereof was provided to the breaching party by the non-breaching party, by providing written notice of termination to the breaching party and (ii) by GSK at any time if it decides not to continue the GSK Evaluation, by sending a written notice of termination to VBI Cda and returning any remaining materials provided to GSK by VBI Cda in connection with the GSK Evaluation. VBI and GSK are currently completing the evaluation in accordance with the GSK Agreement.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we have a total of 88 full-time and 2 part-time employees. The SciVac manufacturing site had 60 full-time employees and the VBI Cda research site employed 22 full-time and 2 part-time employees. The remaining 6 full-time employees worked out of our headquarters in Cambridge, MA. None of our employees are represented by unions. Our management considers its relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities and Offices 
 
Our headquarters is located at 222 Third Street, Suite 2241, Cambridge, MA, 02142. Our manufacturing operations are located in Rehovot, Israel and our primary research facility is located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
 
We rent office, manufacturing and research facility space under various operating leases.
 
Our headquarters, which is comprised of approximately 2,359 square feet of office space, is held pursuant to a lease agreement that was entered into on May 31, 2012 with American Twine Limited Partnership (“ATLP”). The lease has been amended four times since it was entered into for the purpose of revising the length of the term and providing for a new base rent. Pursuant to the fourth amendment, which was entered into on May 1, 2014, the lease term was extended to April 30, 2017 with a base rent for the premises of $10 per month. We are also responsible for the payment of additional rent, including our pro rata share of real estate taxes, operating expenses, as defined in the lease, and betterment assessments, as defined in the lease. Six months following the first anniversary of the date of the fourth amendment and so long as we are not in breach of the terms of the lease, either we or ATLP may terminate the lease upon 60 days’ notice. We are exploring a lease extension or alternative space for the balance of 2017 and the foreseeable future.
 
Our manufacturing facility is comprised of approximately of 3,096 square meters of manufacturing suite, laboratory and office space is held pursuant to a lease agreement that was entered into on June 16, 2006 with Eilot Hashkaot. The lease has been amended four times since it was entered into for the purpose of revising the length of the term and providing for a new base rent. Pursuant to the fourth amendment, which was entered into on February 24, 2016, the lease term was extended to January 31, 2022. The renewed lease includes a five-year option to extend until January 31, 2027 with an increase of 10%. The amount of the lease is approximately $29 per month and linked to the consumer price index (CPI). We entered into an agreement on September 5, 2016 for additional office space of 490 square meters (fifth amendment to the lease agreement) under which we are obligated to pay an additional $5 per month and linked to the CPI. The commitments for existing and additional space are for a term of five years ending January 31, 2022. With a five-year option to extend until January 31, 2027 with an increase of 10%. On January 16, 2017, we entered into a Sub lease agreement for additional office space of 200 Square meters with Green Power YE. YM. The term of the sub-sublease extends to January 22, 2018. We have the right to extend the term for additional one year. The amount of the lease is a fixed price including all rental utilities of $7 per month.

VBI Cda’s research facility, which is comprised of laboratory and office space, is held pursuant to a sub-sublease that was entered into on September 1, 2014 with Iogen Corporation and subsequently amended to include some additional space and extend the initial term to December 31, 2019. VBI Cda has the right to extend the term for two periods of three years. VBI Cda has a right to terminate the sub-sublease after one year by providing no less than 6 months’ notice to Iogen Corporation, while Iogen Corporation has the right to terminate the sub-sublease after the second year by providing no less than 6 months’ notice to VBI Cda. The base and additional rent for the premises is currently nineteen dollars USD per square foot per year through December 31, 2019. VBI Cda is also responsible for its pro rata share of additional rent, payable monthly, which includes, but is not limited to, operating and maintenance costs, real estate taxes, general maintenance and repair costs, insurance and professional fees. In addition to the base rent and the additional rent, VBI Cda is responsible for the payment of a refundable harmonized sales tax as require by the Excise Tax Act (Canada). Pursuant to the sub-sublease, the additional rent per month will not exceed eighteen dollars CAD per square foot of rentable premises. VBI Cda was required to provide a security deposit in the amount of $18.8 CAD which Iogen Corporation will hold until the end of the term and may, in the event of a failure by VBI Cda to pay rent as and when due, apply the security deposit to the unpaid rent obligation.
 
Pursuant to these leases, we have made or will make minimum annual payments of approximately $744 in 2017.
 
We believe that our office, manufacturing and research facilities are suitable and adequate for our current operations but will consider term extensions or expansion of leased space, depending on market conditions and needs.
 
Cost of Revenues and Services 
 
Cost of revenues and services includes direct costs and some allocated indirect costs related to the production, manufacturing and services activities in Israel including but not limited to the costs of materials, consumables, supplies and contractors. Once sales and production volumes increase to sufficient amount, the full cost of production, manufacturing and services will be used to calculate a gross margin, however, at this time with the current volumes, a gross margin would not provide meaningful information.
 
Research and Development
 
We invest heavily in R&D. R&D expenses were $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. All R&D was funded by equity, term loan or convertible note financings or government grants and refundable R&D tax credits. Our most significant R&D expense has been, and is expected to continue to be, related mainly to our development of a CMV vaccine candidate and the related eVLP platform. Such R&D expenses are expected to increase significantly as the vaccine moves into the clinical development stage and explores other vaccine opportunities and/or collaborations.
 
With the acquisition of VBI DE in 2016, our top R&D priority has been the CMV vaccine candidate’s GMP manufacturing and its clinical development. Our CMV vaccine candidate was designed internally, and its manufacturing and purification processes were designed by the NRC in collaboration with our staff. Such processes and internal knowledge were transferred to our selected GMP manufacturer, Paragon, and required significant project management expertise and confirmatory R&D studies throughout 2014. In 2015, we engaged a contract research organization, ITR Laboratories Canada Inc., and completed GLP toxicology trials to confirm the safety of the CMV vaccine candidate in animals. In September 2016, we completed the enrollment and initial dosing of 128 participants in the Phase I clinical study to evaluate its preventative CMV vaccine candidate. The Phase I study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of our CMV vaccine candidate in 128 healthy CMV-negative adults. The third and final vaccination was administered in February 2017. The study will also measure levels of vaccine-induced CMV neutralizing antibodies that may prevent CMV infection. Preliminary results are anticipated in the first half of 2017.
 
As previously described, we expect to make additional R&D investments in our LPV platform, which we expect will be driven by partner-led collaborations, if any.

Intellectual Property 
 
Our IP portfolio, includes 19 active patent families consisting of 135 fully owned or exclusively licensed allowed patents and patent applications, which include 54 issued patents. The highlights of our patent portfolio include:

● | CMV vaccine related IP: we own two patent families which directly address our CMV vaccine candidate. These patents include a composition of matter patent describing the lead CMV vaccine as well as a proprietary assay used to provide high-throughput screening of anti-CMV vaccine responses. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | eVLP vaccine related IP: we have an exclusive license and/or co-invention rights to four additional patent families that protect the eVLP vaccine platform and derivatives thereof. Among these patents are rights that were originally developed at the UPMC, with which we hold a world-wide exclusive license to the base technology for the design of an eVLP. 
● | LPV vaccine related IP: we own six patent families which protect our LPV technology platform. These patents include the method for manufacturing an LPV so as to confer thermostability, the proprietary ratios of excipients and antigens that are required to give rise to a thermostable formulation, and specific parameters required to confer thermostability to several distinct classes of vaccine antigens and biologic proteins. 

 
We have a process of continuously monitoring the competitive landscape for infectious disease vaccines to better understand the research, business and patent activities of our academic and industrial competitors. This process helps management to understand the competitive positioning of the lead CMV project. This knowledge has informed and shaped our patent portfolio, which is designed to protect our proprietary vaccine technologies and establish a defense against third-party infringement claims. Our earliest filed patent family (9 of which have now been issued) have a patent term that extends to 2020. Our earliest filed licensed patent family (7 of which have now been issued) have a patent term that extends to 2017. Our most recently filed applications (if granted) will have a patent term that extends to 2037.
 
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
 
Vaccine development is a highly regulated field. The manufacturing and marketing of our potential products and our ongoing research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies of local, state and foreign jurisdictions, such as Health Canada in Canada. New products must go through extensive preclinical and clinical development prior to product launch. This process can take more than ten years from candidate identification to licensure/marketing approval by health authorities worldwide. Despite efforts to harmonize regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions, there exists a divergence of legal and regulatory requirements in different countries and territories. Delays in regulatory approval to move from one stage of development to another can potentially cause us significant delays and can affect our market capitalization.
United States, Europe and Canada Regulatory Agencies.
 
Before any of our products can be marketed and sold in the U.S., Europe or Canada, they must receive approval from the relevant regulatory agencies, including the FDA, EMA or Health Canada, respectively. To receive regulatory approvals to market any drug or vaccine, including those we develop, the products in development must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical studies that demonstrate the product’s safety and effectiveness for each indicated use. This extensive regulatory path includes process controls in development, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of the pharmaceutical products.
 
In general, before any new pharmaceutical product can be marketed in the mentioned geographical areas, the process typically required by the regulatory agencies includes:
 

● | preclinical toxicology, laboratory and animal tests; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an investigational new drug application (an “IND”), which must be reviewed by the FDA before human clinical trials may begin; submission of a Scientific Advice application to EMA or submission of a pre-Clinical Trial Application to Health Canada; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigator sites;

Preclinical Testing
 
In the United States, drug candidates are tested in animals until adequate proof of safety and efficacy is established. These preclinical studies generally evaluate the mechanism of action and pharmacology of the product and assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Tested compounds must be produced according to applicable current GMP requirements and preclinical safety tests must be conducted in compliance with FDA and international regulations regarding good laboratory practices. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are generally submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA requests an extension or raises concerns about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the application. If the FDA has any concerns, the sponsor of the application and the FDA must resolve those concerns before clinical trials may begin. Regulatory authorities may require additional preclinical data before allowing the clinical studies to commence or proceed from one phase to another, and could demand that the studies be discontinued or suspended at any time if there are significant safety issues. Furthermore, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to participate in the conduct of the clinical trial must review and approve the clinical protocol and patient informed consent form before commencement of the study at the respective medical center.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials for new vaccine drug candidates are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the vaccine drug candidate into human volunteers, the emphasis is on testing for safety or adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and clinical pharmacology. Phase II involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the vaccine drug candidate for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a vaccine compound shows evidence of effectiveness and is found to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, pivotal Phase III trials are undertaken to more fully evaluate clinical outcomes and to establish the overall risk/benefit profile of the drug, and to provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. During all clinical trials, physicians will monitor patients to determine the effectiveness of the drug candidate and to observe and report any reactions or safety risks that may result from use of the vaccine drug candidate. The FDA, the trial sites internal review board and/or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
Data from the clinical trials, together with preclinical data and other supporting information that establishes a vaccine drug candidate’s safety, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA NDA or BLA NDA supplement (for approval of a new indication if the product candidate is already approved for another indication). Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually given an internal administrative review within 45 to 60 days following submission of the BLA NDA. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of six months for priority BLA NDAs (for vaccines or drugs addressing serious or life threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need) and ten months for regular BLA NDAs. However, these are agency proposed time frames, and so the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, is not typically an actual approval, but an “action letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the BLA NDA can be approved. The FDA’s review of a BLA NDA may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA NDA or BLA NDA supplement if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or the FDA may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase III clinical study. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the BLA NDA or BLA NDA supplement does not satisfy its criteria for approval.

Data Review and Approval
 
Substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, clinical trials and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies. It normally takes many years to satisfy these various legal and regulatory requirements, assuming they are ever satisfied. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. Accordingly, the actual time and expense required to bring a product to market may vary substantially. We cannot assure you that we will submit applications for required authorizations to manufacture and/or market potential products or that any such application will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in a timely manner, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or have conditions placed on them that restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products.
 
Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA also has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA may also request additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase IVstudies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. The results of Phase IV studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information via the FDA’s voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system. Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to any FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the GMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown negative effects of a product may result in restrictions on the product or even its complete withdrawal from the market.
 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. Approval is typically subject to post-marketing surveillance and other record keeping and reporting obligations, and involves ongoing requirements such as post-marketing annual reports and labeling updates. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and/or criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of such off-label use.
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
 
The traditional approval process for new drugs is set out in Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An alternative pathway to FDA approval, established by Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, permits the applicant to rely on certain preclinical or clinical information generated by others for an approved product as some of the information required for approval and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the indications for which the referenced product was approved, as well as for any new indications sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 
To the extent a Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on existing information for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book publication. Specifically, the applicant must certify that either: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is valid or will not be infringed by the new product. If the applicant does not challenge the unexpired listed patents, the Section 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.

Fast Track Approval
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the related FDA regulations provide certain mechanisms for the accelerated “Fast Track” approval of potential products intended to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses which have demonstrated the potential to address unmet medical needs. These procedures permit early consultation and commitment from the FDA regarding the preclinical and clinical studies necessary to gain marketing approval. Provisions of this regulatory framework also permit, in certain cases, BLA NDAs to be approved on the basis of valid indirect measurements of benefit of product effectiveness, thus accelerating the normal approval process. In the future, certain potential products employing our technology might qualify for this accelerated regulatory procedure. Even if the FDA agrees that these potential products qualify for accelerated approval procedures, FDA may deny approval of our drugs or may require additional studies before approval. The FDA may also require us to perform post-approval, or Phase IV, studies as a condition of such early approval. In addition, the FDA may impose restrictions on distribution and/or promotion in connection with any accelerated approval, and may withdraw approval if post-approval studies do not confirm the intended clinical benefit or safety of the potential product.
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. These very limited circumstances are (i) an inability to supply the drug in sufficient quantities or (ii) a situation in which a new formulation of the drug has shown superior safety or efficacy. This exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our product for seven years if a competitor obtains earlier approval of the same drug for the same indication.
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will continue to be subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must separately obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of those foreign countries before we may commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
Under the applicable EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. This authorization is a marketing authorization application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions.
 
Under this decentralized procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. This procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.

Other Government Regulation
 
Our research and development activities use biological and hazardous materials that are dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes resulting from these materials. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and federal and state environmental protection agencies and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act.
 
In addition, once our products are marketed commercially, we will have to comply with the various laws relating to the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following:
 

● | The anti-kickback statute (Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) which prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other governmental programs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The physician self-referral prohibition (Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, as amended, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act), which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which the physicians (or their immediate family members) have ownership interests or with which they have certain other financial arrangements; 
● | The anti-inducement law (Section 1128A(a)(5) of the Social Security Act), which prohibits providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program; 
● | The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.), which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs); and 
● | The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (Section 1128A of the Social Security Act), which authorizes the United States Department of Health and Human Services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts. 

 
Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or some combination thereof. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from Medicare and other government programs.
 
We are building our government relations and regulatory capabilities by leveraging consultants who have extensive experience with the regulatory process. Consultants we have hired include Florian Schodel who led the clinical development of several vaccines through licensure at Merck Research Laboratories for over a decade.
 
We also use additional regulatory consultants including several former FDA regulators with experience at the Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research (“CBER”) which is the division of FDA that regulates vaccines and other drugs.
