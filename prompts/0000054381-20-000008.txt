ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

GENERAL
Kaman Corporation, headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut, was incorporated in 1945. We are a diversified company that conducts business in the aerospace, medical and industrial markets. The Company produces and markets proprietary aircraft bearings and components; super precision, miniature ball bearings; proprietary spring energized seals, springs and contacts; complex metallic and composite aerostructures for commercial, military and general aviation fixed and rotary wing aircraft; and safe and arming solutions for missile and bomb systems for the U.S. and allied militaries. The Company also manufactures and supports our K-MAX® manned and unmanned medium-to-heavy lift helicopters and restores, modifies and supports our SH-2G Super Seasprite maritime helicopters.
Principal customers include the U.S. military, foreign allied militaries, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, The Boeing Company, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Rolls-Royce, Raytheon and Bell Helicopter. The SH-2G aircraft is currently in service with the Egyptian Air Force and the New Zealand, Peruvian and Polish navies. Operations are conducted throughout the United States, as well as in facilities located in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Singapore. Additionally, the Company maintains an investment in a joint venture in India. In the year ended December 31, 2019, three individual customers, the U.S. Government, The Boeing Company and a Joint Programmable Fuze ("JPF") direct commercial sales ("DCS") customer, accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales.
We report information for ourselves and our subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” and “the Company”) in a single business segment, Aerospace. In 2019, the Company completed the sale of its Distribution business for total cash consideration of $700.0 million, excluding certain working capital adjustments and transaction costs. Prior to the sale of the Distribution business, the Company was composed of two segments. As the Company had not made any fundamental changes to its management or organization structure, the Aerospace segment is reflective of how the Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is its Chief Operating Decision Maker, reviews operating results for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.
On January 3, 2020, the Company announced that it had completed the acquisition of Bal Seal Engineering Inc. ("Bal Seal"), at a purchase price of approximately $331.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Bal Seal is a leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of highly engineered products including precision springs, seals and contacts. Bal Seal has an established global presence, with manufacturing facilities across the United States and sales representation in the United States, Europe and Asia. A discussion of 2019 developments is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K.
WORKING CAPITAL
A discussion of our working capital is included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, in this Form 10-K.
Our working capital requirements are dependent on the nature and life cycles of the programs for which work is performed. New programs may initially require higher working capital to complete nonrecurring start-up activities and fund the purchase of inventory and equipment necessary to perform the work. Nonrecurring start-up costs on large and complex programs often take longer to recover, negatively impacting working capital in the short-term and producing a corresponding benefit in future periods. As these programs mature and efficiencies are gained in the production process, working capital requirements generally decrease.
Our credit agreement is a revolving credit facility which is available for additional working capital requirements and investment opportunities. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
The following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each major product line to consolidated net sales for each of the three most recently completed years:

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Sales | | | | | 
Military and Defense, excluding safe and arm devices | 23.4 | % | | 25.9 | % | 27.8 | %
Safe and Arm Devices | 29.9 | % | | 26.6 | % | 25.5 | %
Commercial Aerospace and Other | 46.7 | % | | 47.5 | % | 46.7 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
While we believe we have sufficient sources for the materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing activities, we are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium, nickel, steel, copper and composites. Many major components and product equipment items are procured from or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic and non-U.S. companies. Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at anticipated costs. While we maintain an extensive qualification system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability, while jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. From time to time, we have experienced shortages in raw materials which have impacted our near term results; however, we do not foresee any near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have an adverse effect on our business. For further discussion of the possible effects of changes in the cost or availability of raw materials on our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10-K.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We use patented and unpatented proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets to develop, maintain and enhance our competitive position, but we believe our continued success depends more on the knowledge, ability, experience and technological expertise of our employees than the legal protection that our patents and other proprietary rights may afford. Moreover, while we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, physical and information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property, data and technology rights and that of third parties with which we are entrusted, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property, data and technology rights may be limited by a variety of factors and may be even more limited in certain countries outside the U.S., as may be our ability to prevent theft or compromise of our intellectual property, data and technology by competitors or third parties. 
As of December 31, 2019, we held a total of 71 patents, 7 of which were U.S. patents and 64 of which were foreign patents. We acquired an additional 93 U.S. patents and 149 foreign patents in connection with our acquisition of Bal Seal, increasing our total patent portfolio to 313 as of January 3, 2020. In addition, we have numerous U.S. and foreign patents pending. The Company believes the duration of its patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products.
 Trademarks are also an important aspect of our business. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and registrations are maintained. We sell products under a number of registered trademarks that we own. Registered trademarks of the Company include KAflex®, KAron®, and K-MAX®. In all, we maintain 23 U.S. and foreign trademarks as of December 31, 2019.

BACKLOG
We anticipate that approximately 63.4% of our backlog at the end of 2019 will be performed in 2020. Approximately 30.3% of our backlog at the end of 2019 is related to U.S. Government ("USG") contracts or subcontracts.
Total backlog at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and the portion of the backlog we expect to complete in 2020, is as follows:

 | Total Backlog atDecember 31, 2019 | | 2019 Backlog to becompleted in 2020 | Total Backlog atDecember 31, 2018 | | Total Backlog atDecember 31, 2017
In thousands | | | | | | 
Backlog | $ | 806,870 | | $ | 511,765 | | $ | 851,814 | $ | 616,090

Backlog related to uncompleted contracts for which we have recorded a provision for estimated losses was $2.1 million as of December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, there was no backlog related to firm but not yet funded orders. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion.
REGULATORY MATTERS

Government Contracts
The USG, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience or for default if we fail to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the USG would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The USG can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.
During 2019, approximately 96.0% of the work performed by the Company directly or indirectly for the USG was performed on a fixed-price basis and the balance was performed on a cost-reimbursement basis. Under a fixed-price contract, the price paid to the contractor is negotiated at the outset of the contract and is not generally subject to adjustment to reflect the actual costs incurred by the contractor in the performance of the contract. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and an additional negotiated fee.
Compliance with Environmental Protection Laws
Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters in an effort to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are generally allowable costs under our contracts with the USG. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if more stringent clean-up standards are imposed, additional contamination is discovered and/or clean-up costs are higher than estimated.
See Environmental Matters in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Critical Accounting Estimates - Environmental Costs in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion of our environmental matters.

With respect to all other matters that may currently be pending, in the opinion of management, based on our analysis of relevant facts and circumstances, we do not believe that compliance with relevant environmental protection laws is likely to have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In arriving at this conclusion, we have taken into consideration site-specific information available regarding total costs of any work to be performed and the extent of work previously performed. If we are identified as a “potentially responsible party” ("PRP") by environmental authorities at a particular site, we, using information available to us, will also review and consider a number of other factors, including: (i) the financial resources of other PRPs involved in each site and their proportionate share of the total volume of waste at the site; (ii) the existence of insurance, if any, and the financial viability of the insurers; and (iii) the success others have had in receiving reimbursement for similar costs under similar insurance policies issued during the periods applicable to each site.
International Operations
Our international sales are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. International sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
COMPETITION
The Company operates in a highly competitive environment with many other organizations, some of which are substantially larger than us and have greater financial strength and more extensive resources. We compete for composite and metallic aerostructures subcontracts, and helicopter sales and structures, bearings and components business on the basis of price and/or quality; product endurance and special performance characteristics; proprietary knowledge; the quality of our products and services; the availability of facilities, equipment and personnel to perform contracts; and the reputation of our business. Competitors for our business include small machine shops and offshore manufacturing facilities. We compete for advanced technology fuzing business primarily on the basis of technical competence, product quality and price, and also on the basis of our experience as a developer and manufacturer of fuzes for particular weapon types and the availability of our facilities, equipment and personnel. We are also affected by the political and economic circumstances of our potential foreign customers and, in certain situations, the relationships of those foreign customers with the USG, the USG's perceptions of those foreign customers and the ability to obtain necessary export approvals, licenses or authorizations from the U.S. Government.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2019, we employed 2,935 individuals.
